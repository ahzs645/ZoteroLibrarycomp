KLU7WISF,Unsettling a settler society,bookSection,"[{'firstName': 'Leonie', 'lastName': 'Sandercock', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'Giovanni', 'lastName': 'Attili', 'creatorType': 'author'}]",2012-01-01,,https://sapienza.pure.elsevier.com/it/publications/unsettling-a-settler-society-film-phronesis-and-collaborative-pla,"['EG5BYG2X', '5JRIR9ZQ']",[{'tag': 'Saturation search (2)'}],"Prologue Five years ago we heard three anecdotes about the small town of Burns Lake in northern British Columbia that whetted our phronetic research appetite, as well as our evolving interest in film as a mode of inquiry and a way of approaching collaborative and transformational planning. This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."
K3DRHGMX,Characterization of the short-term temporal variability of road dust chemical mixtures and meteorological profiles in a near-road urban site in British Columbia,journalArticle,"[{'firstName': 'ES', 'lastName': 'Coker', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'NS', 'lastName': 'Turna', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'M', 'lastName': 'Schouwenburg', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'A', 'lastName': 'Jalil', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'C', 'lastName': 'Bradshaw', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'MC', 'lastName': 'Kuo', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'M', 'lastName': 'Mastel', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'H', 'lastName': 'Kazemian', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'M', 'lastName': 'Roushorne', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'SB', 'lastName': 'Henderson', 'creatorType': 'author'}]",2023 JUN 3,10.1080/10962247.2023.2186964,,['MRW66E3Y'],"[{'tag': 'PARTICLES'}, {'tag': 'HEAVY-METALS'}, {'tag': 'AIR-POLLUTION'}, {'tag': 'AMBIENT AIR'}, {'tag': 'DAILY MORTALITY'}, {'tag': 'EXPOSURE'}, {'tag': 'HEALTH-RISK'}, {'tag': 'PARTICULATE MATTER CONSTITUENTS'}, {'tag': 'SIZE DISTRIBUTION'}, {'tag': 'SOURCE APPORTIONMENT'}]","Springtime road dust is a common air quality concern for northern latitudes communities. Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics.

To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical.

Both morphs are semelparous typically maturing at age four, the anadromous morph (sockeye) at fork lengths of 38-65 cm and the nonanadromous morph (kokanee) at 17-22 cm. When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely.

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.
Contexte : Dans les mois precedant le confinement de la COVID-19 en mars 2020, un mouvement important s'est developpe partout sur le territoire dit canadien. Ce qui avait commence comme une lutte regionale pour le droit a l'autodetermination des Wet'suwet'en est devenu un moment decisif de resistance, refus, et solidarite de la part des nations autochtones a l'echelle nationale.Analyses : Cet article s'inspire de l'analyse des cadres mediatiques pour examiner l'utilisation d'un lexique de guerre dans les representations faites par les medias des mouvements de solidarite pour les Wet'suwet'en au debut de 2020. L'analyse suggere que le lexique de guerre sert simultanement a naturaliser la violence policiere et a valider la souverainete des nations autochtones.Conclusion et implications : Cette recherche contribue non seulement a la litterature sur la maniere dont les medias grand public encadrent les manifestations, mais aussi au projet en cours qui consiste a remettre en question le pouvoir exerce par les colons dans la societe canadienne."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

Biological responses were measured in the liver to assess the effects of contaminants on the fish before they began migration downstream. Both ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP 1A concentrations were significantly enhanced, being two- to three-fold higher in Fraser River samples compared with those fish from reference sites on the Nechako River. DNA adduct concentrations were two- to four-fold higher in Fraser River fish, although liver histopathology appeared unaffected. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the carcasses contributed to total contaminant burdens of less than 1 pg,g(-1). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were undetectable in nearly all samples of bile. There were strong correlations between EROD activity, CYP 1A induction, and DNA adduct concentrations but no clear correlation between these responses and PCDD, PCDF, or PCB concentrations."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations.

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action.

The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design.

In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006."

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris"

This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts."

Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region."

Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism."

Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes."

As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?)."

The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE."

This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest."

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River."

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers."

To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity."

The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat."

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue."

Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time."

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments."

What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment."

We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus."

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system."

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes."

Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation."

These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship."

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region."

Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt."

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly."

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure."

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool."

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed."

Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species."

When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities."

This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

RVKZLLN4,Annihilation of both place and sense of place: the experience of the Cheslatta T'En Canadian First Nation within the context of large-scale environmental projects,journalArticle,"[{'firstName': 'JE', 'lastName': 'Windsor', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'JA', 'lastName': 'McVey', 'creatorType': 'author'}]",2005,10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00156.x,,['MRW66E3Y'],"[{'tag': 'British Columbia'}, {'tag': 'Canada'}, {'tag': 'First Nations'}, {'tag': 'SOCIETY'}, {'tag': 'place'}, {'tag': 'COLONIZATION'}, {'tag': 'dams'}, {'tag': 'GEOGRAPHY'}, {'tag': 'HOME'}, {'tag': 'loss of sense of place'}, {'tag': 'LOWRY'}, {'tag': 'MALCOLM'}, {'tag': 'PERSPECTIVE'}, {'tag': 'SPACE'}]","The water resources of Canada are today, and have always been, of major importance to the welfare of Canadians. Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan)."
LMY277VM,Cytochrome P450 1A and related measurements in juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the Fraser River,journalArticle,"[{'firstName': 'JY', 'lastName': 'Wilson', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'RF', 'lastName': 'Addison', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'D', 'lastName': 'Martens', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'R', 'lastName': 'Gordon', 'creatorType': 'author'}, {'firstName': 'B', 'lastName': 'Glickman', 'creatorType': 'author'}]",2000,10.1139/cjfas-57-2-405,,['MRW66E3Y'],"[{'tag': 'BRITISH-COLUMBIA'}, {'tag': 'FISH'}, {'tag': 'WASHINGTON'}, {'tag': 'KRAFT MILL EFFLUENT'}, {'tag': 'CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE'}, {'tag': 'DNA-ADDUCTS'}, {'tag': 'ENGLISH SOLE'}, {'tag': 'LIVER-MICROSOMES'}, {'tag': 'PUGET-SOUND'}, {'tag': 'SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE'}]","Juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were captured at six sites on the upper Fraser, Nechako, and Thompson rivers, British Columbia, Canada. Biological responses were measured in the liver to assess the effects of contaminants on the fish before they began migration downstream. Both ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP 1A concentrations were significantly enhanced, being two- to three-fold higher in Fraser River samples compared with those fish from reference sites on the Nechako River. DNA adduct concentrations were two- to four-fold higher in Fraser River fish, although liver histopathology appeared unaffected. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the carcasses contributed to total contaminant burdens of less than 1 pg,g(-1). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were undetectable in nearly all samples of bile. There were strong correlations between EROD activity, CYP 1A induction, and DNA adduct concentrations but no clear correlation between these responses and PCDD, PCDF, or PCB concentrations."
