AB  - Analysis of data from four sockeye rearing lakes of the Fraser River system for periods of up to 20 yr provided information on the relation of estimated fish density (female spawners/ha), temperature, and zooplankton standing crops to growth. The lakes differed widely in all attributes. Growth was inversely related to estimated population density in three of the lakes, but wide variations in growth at low density occurred in the fourth, a cold lake at high elevation with short growing season. In this lake, and to a lesser extent in another lake with short growing season, temperature during fry emergence and early lake residence accounted for much of the recorded fluctuation in growth. Reduced zooplankton abundance was associated with high sockeye density in two of the lakes with intermediate standing crops and greatest sockeye densities, but was not recorded in a lake of low standing crop and intermediate sockeye density. Sockeye feeding was found to be highly selective in one lake, and a limited proportion of the zooplankton standing crop was utilized. It is suggested that reduction in standing crop by grazing of juvenile sockeye, and associated decrease in growth, is greatest as the large zooplankters are progressively reduced in abundance. Further reduction in standing crop and in sockeye growth was suggested to proceed at a slower rate. Competition at high population density was concluded to be the factor most responsible for reducing sockeye growth.

AB  - Researchers have cautioned against the borrowing of consumption and growth parameters from other species and life stages in bioenergetics growth models. In particular, the function that dictates temperature dependence in maximum consumption (Cmax) within the Wisconsin bioenergetics model for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha produces estimates that are lower than those measured in published laboratory feeding trials. We used published and unpublished data from laboratory feeding trials with subyearling Chinook Salmon from three stocks (Snake, Nechako, and Big Qualicum rivers) to estimate and adjust the model parameters for temperature dependence in Cmax. The data included growth measures in fish ranging from 1.5 to 7.2 g that were held at temperatures from 14°C to 26°C. Parameters for temperature dependence in Cmax were estimated based on relative differences in food consumption, and bootstrapping techniques were then used to estimate the error about the parameters. We found that at temperatures between 17°C and 25°C, the current parameter values did not match the observed data, indicating that Cmax should be shifted by about 4°C relative to the current implementation under the bioenergetics model. We conclude that the adjusted parameters for Cmax should produce more accurate predictions from the bioenergetics model for subyearling Chinook Salmon.Received May 20, 2014; accepted November 5, 2014

AB  - Since the early 1980s, a water temperature management program has been in existence on the Nechako River system in central British Columbia, Canada. The program releases water based on anticipated meteorological conditions in an attempt to prevent temperature from exceeding a specified threshold of 20°C downstream during a period when spawning migrations of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka are in the Nechako River. Since the inception of the program, this threshold has been exceeded only rarely; however, the variables that influence water temperature and that are used to manage water releases in the Nechako River watershed have not been subject to an independent analysis. Increasing demand for water at other times of year and a desire to restore a more natural hydrograph to the river to meet other ecological demands have impelled this analysis. A principal components analysis that examined the factors contributing to river temperature demonstrated that the summer controlled flow releases accounted for 24% of the temperature variability and were probably a factor in maintaining compliance with the program's temperature threshold. Furthermore, during most summers, the Nechako River provided a cooling influence to input from the Stuart River tributary in a downstream reach that is used by the majority of the migrating sockeye salmon. Water temperature has a modest influence on prespawning mortality (up to 22% of the variability), suggesting that attempts to reduce summer water temperatures through releases in the upper Nechako River watershed can mitigate against poor spawning success of sockeye salmon populations that migrate through the lower reaches of the system.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a well established technology for the reduction of organic matter and stabilization of wastewater. Biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, is produced as a useful by-product of the process. Current solid waste management at the city of Prince George is focused on disposal of waste and not on energy recovery. Co-digestion of fresh fruit and vegetable waste with sewer sludge can improve biogas yield by increasing the load of biodegradable material. A six week full-scale project co-digesting almost 15,000 kg of supermarket waste was completed.

AB  - Population viability has often been assessed by census of reproducing adults. Recently this method has been called into question and estimation of the effective population size (Ne) proposed as a complementary method to determine population health. We examined genetic diversity in five populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Fraser River watershed (British Columbia, Canada) at 11 microsatellite loci over 20 years using DNA extracted from archived scale samples. We tested for changes in genetic diversity, calculated the ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size to give the statistic M, calculated Ne from the temporal change in allele frequency, used the maximum likelihood method to calculate effective population size (NeM), calculated the harmonic mean of population size, and compared these statistics to annual census estimates. Over the last two decades population size has increased in all five populations of chinook examined; however, Ne calculated for each population was low (81-691) and decreasing over the time interval measured. Values of NeM were low, but substantially higher than Ne calculated using the temporal method. The calculated values for M were generally low (M < 0.70), indicating recent population reductions for all five populations. Large-scale historic barriers to migration and development activities do not appear to account for the low values of Ne; however, available spawning area is positively correlated with Ne. Both Ne and M estimates indicate that these populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding effects and may lack the ability to respond adaptively to stochastic events. Our findings question the practice of relying exclusively on census estimates for interpreting population health and show the importance of determining genetic diversity within populations.

AB  - This article examines the conflicting subjectivities and space-times of Indigenous and colonial law that underpin the recent shutdown of the Canadian economy as people barricaded railways and ports in solidarity with the Witsuwit'en hereditary chiefs' blockade against the Coastal GasLink pipeline across their territory. The article argues that this conflict between Canadian and Witsuwit'en law reflects fundamental tensions between their respective foundations in relations of the commodity and the gift. Within settler capitalist society, the value of a commodity is constructed relationally through a political economy of exchange that aims to speed transactions to maximize profits. With an ongoing drive for time-space compression, there is continual pressure in settler capitalism to develop new infrastructure that can speed the circulation of commodities. In Witsuwit'en society, the gift presents a contrasting logic of place-time extension. Rather than focusing on closing transactions to increase profits, gift giving stretches reciprocal obligations into the past and future. Contrasting these distinct conceptions of the relationship between value and time, the article argues that the Witsuwit'en struggle with Coastal GasLink should be understood as conflict between colonial temporal enclosures and a radical promise to open futures different to those engendered by the colonial present.

AB  - Research around the world has been nearly unanimous about the positive impacts of Indigenous-led health organizations on Indigenous peoples' qualitative experiences in health care, in the face of often negative experiences in non-Indigenous-led health care settings. Urban environments, including health care environments, are areas of increasing attention with regard to Indigenous peoples' health in Canada. In this study, which took place in the northern city of Prince George, British Columbia, 65 Indigenous community members and health services workers participated in interviews and focus groups, describing their experiences with urban Indigenous-led health organizations-defined in this study as non-governmental organizations that prioritize the values and practices of local Indigenous communities. Employing perspectives on place and relationships drawn from Indigenous critical theory and Indigenous community resurgence to analyze the findings of this qualitative study leads to a focus on how relationships impact and can even constitute places, enabling new understandings of the roles of Indigenous-led health organizations in urban Indigenous community resurgence.

AB  - This paper explores how remixed methodologies can inform research in Indigenous communities using short films, combining archival and contemporary footage. Drawing on the lineages of Indigenous and feminist community-based research methodologies, we develop a three-part conception of remixed methodologies. We emphasize, first, the need to resituate the process of knowledge production within relationships between researchers and Indigenous community members. Second, we stress the importance of reconsidering the intended outputs of community-university collaboration to centre community goals. Third, we underscore how remixed methodologies can disrupt the narratives surrounding settler colonial archival resources, resituating historical footage with relation to contemporary Indigenous contexts. We apply this framework to our collaborative work with the Witsuwit'en Cultural and Language Authority and the Office of Aboriginal Education at British Columbia School District #54, combining archival and contemporary films to create Indigenous education resources. Specifically, we remixed footage of Witsuwit'en traditional activities from two 1927 National Museum of Canada films with contemporary interviews and footage of Witsuwit'en governance and land use activities. We highlight how making archival films relevant to contemporary Indigenous community goals required disrupting the conventions of scholarly authority, designing collaborative outputs to suit community aims, and resituating knowledge production within the context of Witsuwit'en resilience in the face of colonialism.

AB  - Academics and champions seeking to guide and implement proactive climate change adaptation must be aware of how local political factors can be a barrier or a benefit to action. With a wave of support, the City of Prince George, Canada, pursued adaptation initiatives for six years; however, part way through the project, political changes resulted in a local governmental shift in focus. Semi-structured interviews with local experts reflect on how political changes affected the nature and legacy of adaptation in Prince George. Respondents indicated that the new political regime was not anti-environmental but explicitly focused on reducing costs, which meant minimizing studies and providing essential services. Initiatives related to transportation infrastructure and land use planning continued to move forward, whereas issues related to flooding and ecosystems were stalled. Plans and strategies that make clear links to costs and actions, and where the public clearly understands how inactions will affect them, are more likely to move forward in a less supportive political environment. Redundancies in capacity are important to maintain institutional memory. Effective communication is essential for stakeholders to understand why local governments should invest in adaptation, and to potentially present adaptation as a positive unifying direction for a community.

AB  - Almost 1.7 million people in the settler colonial nation of Canada identify as Indigenous. Approximately 52 per cent of Indigenous peoples in Canada live in urban areas. In spite of high rates of urbanization, urban Indigenous peoples are overlooked in health care policy and services. Because of this, although health care services are more plentiful in cities as compared to rural areas, Indigenous people still report significant barriers to health care access in urban settings. This qualitative study, undertaken in Prince George, Canada, examines perceived barriers to health care access for urban Indigenous people in light of how colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples in their everyday lives. The three most frequently reported barriers to health care access on the part of the 65 participating health care providers and Indigenous clients of health care services are: substandard quality of care; long wait times; and experiences of racism and discrimination. These barriers, some of which are common complaints among the general population in Canada, are interpreted by Indigenous clients in unique ways rooted in experiences of discrimination and exclusion that stem from the settler colonial context of the nation. Through the lenses of cultural safety and ethical space frameworks developed by international Indigenous scholars in efforts to better understand and operationalize relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and societies in the context of settler colonialism this study offers an understanding of these barriers in light of the specific ways that colonialism intrudes into Indigenous clients' access to care on an everyday basis.

AB  - Pacific salmon encounter widely varying environmental conditions across populations. Performance traits and environmental tolerance limits are predicted to be related to the typical abiotic and biotic conditions encountered by each population. Endurance swim performance at three different temperatures (8, 12, 22 degrees C) was compared across nine populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792)) parr from British Columbia, Canada, reared in a common laboratory environment. In addition, relative ventricular mass (RVM) was compared between good and poor performers from each population. Populations significantly differed in endurance swim performance and these differences were related to the natal lake environment. Specifically, parr populations that reside in warm, shallow lakes (Okanagan, Scotch, and Stellako) had superior swim performance at 12 degrees C compared with 8 degrees C. All other populations from deeper, cooler lakes had equivalent swim performance at 8 and 12 degrees C. Individual variability in swim performance within a population was not due to differences in cardiac size. Similarly, RVM did not vary across parr populations, suggesting that population differences in swim performance were not associated with cardiac size. This study provides further support that sockeye salmon parr are locally adapted to their environmental conditions.

In 2003, Tl'azt'en Nation and the authors initiated a toponymy study that involved finding a curricular use for Dakelh place names. In this article, we chronicle our experiences with negotiating and managing this study with Tl'azt'en Nation. Some events are specific to the topic; others are characteristic of co-managed research in general. We offer insights into what it means as non-Indigenous researchers to enter discursive territory that is charged with emotion and cultural sensitivity, and also explore the often contentious issues that can arise in Indigenous research, particularly oral history, ethnohistorical interpretation, and cultural representation. The paper concludes by discussing the opportunities and challenges of co-managed research.

AB  - Anadromous salmon migrations are energetically expensive. Long-distance migrants should be efficient in their use of energy and minimize swimming costs wherever possible. We explore swimming strategies and energy-saving tactics employed by three long-distance-migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks in the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia. We used stereovideography and bank-side observations to estimate swimming speeds (from tailbeat frequency) and ground speeds (using distance traveled and duration) for individuals at several sites. Salmon were highly efficient at migration (i.e., ground speeds equaled or exceeded swimming speeds) through reaches with relatively low encountered currents (<0.25 m·s-1). We speculate that salmon exploit small reverse-flow vortices to achieve this feat. With low encountered currents, most salmon migrated according to an optimal swimming speed model: migrants minimized transport costs per unit distance traveled. Generally, salmon were less efficient at mig..., Les migrations anadromes des saumons coûtent cher en énergie. Les poissons qui migrent sur de longues distances doivent faire une utilisation efficace de l'énergie et minimiser chaque fois que c'est possible le coût de la nage. Nous avons examiné les stratégies de nage et les tactiques de conservation d'énergie chez trois populations de saumons rouges (Oncorhynchus nerka) qui migrent sur de longues distances dans le bassin du fleuve Fraser en Colombie-Britannique. À l'aide de vidéographie stéréoscopique et d'observations depuis la rive, il a été possible d'estimer la vitesse de nage (à partir de la fréquence de battement de la queue) et la vitesse au sol (au moyen de la distance parcourue et de la durée du trajet) pour des individus à plusieurs sites. Les saumons sont très efficaces dans leur migration (i.e., la vitesse au sol équivaut à la vitesse de nage ou la surpasse) dans les zones où les courants sont relativement faibles (<0,25 m·s-1). Nous pensons que les saumons utilisent des petits remous en con...

AB  - The area-under-the-curve estimate of salmon escapement is computed from aerial counts of fish and estimates of the residence time of spawners. Imprecision in both of these factors leads to error in the final escapement estimate and, thus, affects its reliability as an index of escapement over time. The population of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Nechako River, British Columbia, was chosen for a case study, and this paper illustrates how simple simulation models can be used to explore the increases in precision about escapement estimates associated with increasing the frequency of aerial flights. Results show that confidence in escapement estimates for the Nechako River Chinook salmon population decreases as the frequency of survey flights decreases; results also show that this pattern is robust to the typically small annual differences in mean residence time in the Nechako River. Such models can help managers optimize the frequency of aerial flights by comparing the benefits of frequent flights (i.e., increased precision in escapement estimates) with the costs of those flights.

AB  - We compared the effect of uncertainty in dose‐response model form on health risk estimates to the effect of uncertainty and variability in exposure. We used three different dose‐response models to characterize neurological effects in children exposed in utero to methylmercury, and applied these models to calculate risks to a native population exposed to potentially contaminated fish from a reservoir in British Columbia. Uncertainty in model form was explicitly incorporated into the risk estimates. The selection of dose‐response model strongly influenced both mean risk estimates and distributions of risk, and had a much greater impact than altering exposure distributions. We conclude that incorporating uncertainty in dose‐response model form is at least as important as accounting for variability and uncertainty in exposure parameters in probabilistic risk assessment.

AB  - We combined dose-response analyses with a probabilistic exposure assessment to estimate the risks to native Canadians who ingest methylmercury via fish consumption from natural lakes and a reservoir in British Columbia. Available dose-response data included multivariate measurements of central nervous system functioning in Iraqi children exposed to methylmercury prenatally. We applied the method of principal components to simplify the data structure. The first principal component described close to 80% of the variability in the data, making it a reasonable choice as an index. The relationship between mercury in maternal hair and the probability of an abnormal neurological effects index was modeled with the logistic and Weibull functions. The goodness-of-fit of the two models is discussed and the results compared to other published dose-response analyses. Exposure distributions were developed to represent methylmercury dose by using observed data on methylmercury contamination in the lakes and reservoir and reasonable assumptions about other key parameters such as fish consumption. We estimated risks to the target population using Monte Carlo simulation. Consumption of reasonable quantities of fish from these bodies of water does not pose a significant risk to the aboriginal population.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δD) in the tissues of animals often correlate with δD of local precipitation. Here we examined the relationship between δD in feathers and growing season precipitation for neotropical migrant songbirds breeding over a continent-wide isotopic gradient. δD values were determined on feathers of 140 individuals of 6 species of wild insectivorous forest songbirds (Setophaga ruticilla, Empidonax minimus, Vermivora peregrinus, Catharus ustulatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Hylocichla mustelina) taken from 14 breeding locations across North America. The δD of feathers was strongly correlated with the δD of growing season precipitation at breeding sites across North America. As feather hydrogen is metabolically inert after growth, this relationship was then used to assess the breeding origins of wintering migrants. Deuterium values of feathers from 64 individuals representing 5 species of migrants (Helmitheros vermivorus, Wilsonia citrina, Hylocichla mustelina, Dumetella carolinensis, Seirus aurocapillus) at a wintering site in Guatemala were consistent with those predicted from the known breeding ranges of these species. This study demonstrates hydrogen isotopes may become a powerful tool for linking breeding and wintering grounds of neotropical migrant songbirds, as well as other migratory species moving between isotopically distinct regions.

AB  - Several mammals have adapted to harsh winter conditions by adopting hibernation strategies that enable them to survive periods of unfavourable environmental conditions. At northern latitudes, black and brown bears can be in a state of hibernation for up to seven months. As a result of this prolonged occupation of one small space, bears can be vulnerable to environmental and human caused disturbances. In this study, we developed a predictive model that identifies potential den habitat for black bears that can assist with management planning for industrial land development activities. We identified 40 dens (17 excavated in soil and 23 natural rock cavities) and used fine-scale information to determine how dens were positioned in forest stands. We found that bears denned in areas on mid to upper slope positions and that soil dens were located mainly in clay-loam soil complexes while rock cavity dens were either caves or cavities in boulder piles. Den location was distant from portions of the study area with relatively high road density. We then used resource selection functions to predict where bear dens might be located on the landscape. When applied to the GIS data, the averaged coefficients suggested that 3.1% of the study area had a high suitability ranking as den habitat while 9.1%, 14.6%, and 73.2% had mid, low, and limited suitability, respectively. In our study area, habitat for den sites is reasonably predictable and should be considered during the planning of industrial activities.

We cite specific research on Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) and Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) habitat to illustrate how nonscience influences can interfere with the dissemination of scientific information and the conduct of science in the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans. The present framework for linking fisheries science with fisheries management has permitted, intentionally or unintentionally, a suppression of scientific uncertainty and a failure to document comprehensively legitimate differences in scientific opinion.

AB  - The concept of industrial ecology is intrinsically appealing, but the practical sustainability of its precepts has yet to be adequately tested beyond the site-specific locations of most of its exemplars. Any environmental assessment must cover both sourcing and markets to establish whether initiatives to minimise mass and energy loss and promote symbiotic activities on-site are well-founded in coherent sustainable strategies for the relevant sectors off-site. The economics of industrial ecology is explored within this analytical framework, examining the interactions between the compositional and the technological elements of production that may combine to decouple environmental pollution from economic growth. Following a brief review of current industrial ecology exemplars in the forest industries sector, contrasting case studies of nascent dematerialisation of forest industries throughput are analysed. British Columbian First Nations' initiatives entailing communal eco-management systems within ancient temperate rainforests are compared with attempts to develop a modern Scottish forest industries cluster based on exotic softwood plantations. The findings emphasise the need for industrial ecology to extend its scope to embrace reform on broader resource management policies, as well as the promotion of site-based ecological technology, if it is to deliver the institutional reflexivity that can internalise both physical and economic environmental externalities.

AB  - Introduction. Disturbed by reports of high concentrations of cadmium in large land mammals in Arctic Canada, community members wondered if they should eat less moose (Alces alces). Study design. Risk assessment modelling. Methods. We measured cadmium concentrations in moose tissues donated by food hunters. As a conservative assumption, we took the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the means. Cadmium intake from other sources we estimated using risk assessment models. Assuming a Tolerable Daily Intake of cadmium of 1 microgram per kg body weight per day, we calculated maximum allowable intakes of moose kidney, liver and muscle. Results. For a non-smoking 70 kg adult, allowable monthly intakes are: 52 kg of moose muscle, or 137 g of kidney, or 516 g of liver. Allowable intakes varied by age and in proportion to body weight. Cigarette smokers (one to 1.5 packs per day) reach the limit even if they consume no moose at all. Conclusions. Adults may continue to eat moose kidney and liver occasionally and in moderate amounts, but children and cigarette smokers should not eat these organs at all. Consumption of moose muscle need not be restricted. Monitoring of cadmium concentrations in moose should continue.

AB  - Generic criteria and indicator (C&amp;I) frameworks have been the focus of recent work on sustainable forest management. These templates, however, may not be an appropriate approach for directing landscape-level forest management strategies. Instead, many argue that sustainable management should be determined using “bottom–up” approaches rather than standardized frameworks. This requires engaging local expertise in defining sustainability. Having a culturally distinct form of local knowledge, Aboriginal communities have an important role to play in decision-making processes. However, conventional participatory approaches, such as generic C&amp;I frameworks and multi-stakeholder planning processes, are often inappropriate for engaging Aboriginal involvement. We suggest that landscape-level forest planning should highlight rather than assimilate cultural perspectives on sustainable forest management. Using the co-managed John Prince Research Forest in central interior British Columbia as a case study, this paper presents the results of using C&amp;I and a scenario planning approach to describe an Aboriginal perspective of good forest stewardship. These results demonstrate that, in contrast with existing C&amp;I frameworks, locally-based sustainability criteria provide better guidance for developing and adapting landscape-level forest plans.

AB  - Conventional public library statistics are invaluable for management’s evaluation of library use and for benchmark comparisons. However, as the range and complexity of library services has grown, the number of performance measures has also proliferated. Since public library statistics cannot easily be combined into an overall measure of performance, researchers have proposed several global performance measures. Metrics such as The Library Quotient and HARPL Index have been received with varying degrees of acceptance. As public libraries compete for funding against other interests within the municipal environment, they require measures that are meaningful, pragmatic and that resonate with local decision makers. Existing metrics do not allow local government officials to easily compare the use of public libraries to other municipal facilities intended for public use or measure the impact of libraries on their users (Streatfield and Markless, 2006, p. 6). A novel approach to public library performance measurement was developed by college students during a volunteer project at the Prince George Public Library. Their time-based metric was further refined after a review of the literature and replicated as a case study research project in 2013. The latter study attempted to answer the following question: how many hours did the residents of Prince George use of the Bob Harkins branch and its collections during the month of August 2013?

AB  - This paper presents an application of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to the Fraser River basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, over the latter half of the twentieth century. The Fraser River is the longest waterway in BC and supports the world’s most abundant Pacific Ocean salmon populations. Previous modeling and observational studies have demonstrated that the FRB is a snow-dominated system, but with climate change, it may evolve to a pluvial regime. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the changing contribution of snow to the hydrology of the FRB over the latter half of the twentieth century. To this end, a 0.25° atmospheric forcing dataset is used to drive the VIC model from 1949 to 2006 (water years) at a daily time step over a domain covering the entire FRB. A model evaluation is first conducted over 11 major subwatersheds of the FRB to quantitatively assess the spatial variations of snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff (R). The ratio of the spatially averaged maximum SWE to R (RSR) is used to quantify the contribution of snow to the runoff in the 11 subwatersheds of interest. From 1949 to 2006, RSR exhibits a significant decline in 9 of the 11 subwatersheds (with p < 0.05 according to the Mann–Kendall test statistics). To determine the sensitivity of RSR, the air temperature and precipitation in the forcing dataset are then perturbed. The ratio RSR decreases more significantly, especially during the 1990s and 2000s, when air temperatures have warmed considerably compared to the 1950s. On the other hand, increasing precipitation by a multiplicative factor of 1.1 causes RSR to decrease. As the climate continues to warm, ecological processes and human usage of natural resources in the FRB may be substantially affected by its transition from a snow to a hybrid (nival/pluvial) and even a rain-dominated system.

AB  - The Aboriginal Forest Planning Process (AFPP) was developed to integrate indigenous and western forest management approaches. The AFPP is a participatory decision-making tool designed to enhance co-management of the John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in central interior British Columbia, Canada and to elicit goals, objectives, criteria, and indicators of sustainable forest management from the JPRFs Aboriginal partners. Analysis of community interview transcripts, traditional land use documentation, and secondary sources resulted in a three-stage approach to information elicitation, management, and application. Resource and social values, concerns, and traditional knowledge are summarized and compiled according to criteria themes and sub-themes. This condensed information is further divided into spatial, quantitative, and qualitative criteria and indicator categories. The AFPP was a useful method for developing forest management goals, objectives and criteria; however, further interviews were required to identify appropriate management indicators.

AB  - Aboriginal tourism is increasingly seen as a strategy for economic diversification by many Aboriginal communities. While demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America has been demonstrated, little is known about visitor product preferences. This information is needed, however, by Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. Using a psychographic segmentation methodology, we surveyed visitors to northern British Columbia who expressed an interest in Aboriginal tourism to explore their interest in specific features of potential Aboriginal tourism products. Three distinct clusters were identified as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on each First Nation’s level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with tourists.

AB  - Biomass can be used for energy purposes by either combustion to heat and power or refining into solid and liquid biofuels. The majority of biomass is used for residential purposes in developing countries. Modern biomass use in industrialized countries is increasing, and more and more biomass is also traded to be used for energy purposes. The purpose of this paper is to locate the 15 largest ethanol, biodiesel, and wood pellet plants. Facilities generating heat, steam and electricity were left out. Secondly it is not generally known what share of biomass users are large plants. Also an effort is made to find out how much these large-scale biomass refining plants use imported feedstock. For the most part, very large industrial processing facilities are found in a small number of countries. The largest ethanol mills are found almost exclusively in the United States, with one very large plant in the Netherlands. The distribution of biodiesel and wood pellet plants is more dispersed. The countries with the most large biodiesel plants include the USA, Brazil, Spain, and the Netherlands. The countries with the most very large wood pellet plants include the USA, Canada, Russia, and Germany. Torrefaction and pyrolysis technologies are still rarely used on industrial scale. Ethanol and wood pellet plants tend to be sourced from local feedstocks, while biodiesel plants are much more likely to use imported feedstocks or a mix of imports and local biomass. All of these fuels are increasingly traded through the international market. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - We examined sites used by 73 caribou located by radio-tracking during spring migration through a forested travel corridor. The physical and botanical characteristics of these sites were described to find what features (if any) distinguished them from the forest at large. Raised and open aspect, sparse tree cover, free-draining soils, and a simple flora with abundant lichens were features common to all the sites, but were lacking in the denser forest around. Scores for these attributes were ordinated by multidimensional scaling of similarities and differences from site to site. Separate searings for (i) terrain features, (ii) tree cover attributes, and (iii) floristic content each yielded a single cluster of points with few outliers and no particular pattern or trend. The inference is that the sites conformed to a single type with limited variation. A profile of the distinguishing characteristics was compiled and then applied to transects through the general migration area by persons unfamiliar with it beforehand. Sites which matched the profile proved easy to identify, even though they comprised only a small proportion of the area. Sites with high scores for the most distinctive attributes had more caribou at the time of radio-tracking.

AB  - Abstract Residents of northern British Columbia's resource-dependent areas have struggled to maintain the integrity of their communities as nonlocal firms exert ever-increasing influence over the region's resources and landscapes. Local leaders both construct and mobilize place as a vital part of their efforts to promote community well-being. This study focuses on the ways that the residents of three towns in the province's northern interior politicized place as a strategy for resisting the political influence and geographic designs of outsiders. The residents drew from their shared emotional response to powerlessness as a means of highlighting the inequities between insiders and outsiders, thereby generating a regional identity that calls into question the socioeconomic effects of resource industrialization in the north. In describing this dialectic between place making and economic restructuring, the article not only expands upon existing theory on place identity, but also contributes to a fuller understanding of the cultural geography of North America's resource-dependent communities.

Following a brief overview of contemporary work in the area of Indigenous geography, the essay unpacks this process of place-based metamorphosis with specific reference to the contributions that appear in the volume. As part of this discussion, we identify the epistemological, methodological, and ethical implications of candid and critical reflection on the relationship between place and experience in Indigenous approaches to geographic research.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large-scale outbreaks. During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000–2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m-2 yr-1 on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959–1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.

AB  - Recent research on the Aboriginal tourism market has revolved predominantly around establishing a profile of the traveller interested in Aboriginal tourism (hereafter referred to as the Aboriginal tourism traveller). Currently, the Aboriginal tourism traveller is generally described as a mature individual who is interested in having authentic experiences of different cultures. However, there is a need for a better understanding of what specific products this particular traveller is interested in, and in what style, format or nature of delivery. The study presented in this article attempts to provide insight into this topic. In a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, a questionnaire containing four potential Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products was administered to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. Despite a primary interest in nature experiences by the majority of visitors, one-third of our sample demonstrated considerable interest in experiences of Aboriginal culture. Results suggest the need for marketing diverse Aboriginal tourism attractions to attract repeat visitors and for offering an introductory experience to Aboriginal culture for first-time visitors.

AB  - British Columbia (BC) forests are estimated to have become a net carbon source in recent years due to tree death and decay caused primarily by mountain pine beetle (MPB) and related post-harvest slash burning practices. BC forest biomass has also become a major source of wood pellets, exported primarily for bioenergy to Europe, although the sustainability and net carbon emissions of forest bioenergy in general are the subject of current debate. We simulated the temporal carbon balance of BC wood pellets against different reference scenarios for forests affected by MPB in the interior BC timber harvesting area using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). We evaluated the carbon dynamics for different insect-mortality levels, at the stand- and landscape level, taking into account carbon storage in the ecosystem, wood products and fossil fuel displacement. Our results indicate that current harvesting practices, in which slash is burnt and only sawdust used for pellet production, require between 20–25 years for beetle-impacted pine and 37–39 years for spruce-dominated systems to reach pre-harvest carbon levels (i.e. break-even) at the stand-level. Using pellets made from logging slash to replace coal creates immediate net carbon benefits to the atmosphere of 17–21 tonnes C ha−1, shortening these break-even times by 9–20 years and resulting in an instant carbon break-even level on stands most severely impacted by the beetle. Harvesting pine dominated sites for timber while using slash for bioenergy was also found to be more carbon beneficial than a protection reference scenario on both stand- and landscape level. However, harvesting stands exclusively for bioenergy resulted in a net carbon source unless the system contained a high proportion of dead trees (>85%). Systems with higher proportions of living trees provide a greater climate change mitigation if used for long lived wood products.

AB  - In this essay I look at environmental impact assessment as it concerns major projects influencing aquatic environments in Canada. Environmental impact assessment is a process aimed at guarding the public interest in the proper use of resources in the aggregate. Compromises are usually worked out on a local basis for each project. More widely conceived trade-offs are favored by all but practised by few. All projects go through various stages, all begin as vague schemes; some crystallize as firm proposals and then go through the assessment process to construction and a subsequent period of operation. Environmental impact assessment as a process should reflect this pattern of activity rather than being just the preparation of statements about projects that are imminent. I have given particular emphasis to the need for follow up on whether what occurred was what was predicted. Also I have stressed the importance of anticipating that some impacts will not be foreseen and, therefore, the necessity for making ap..., La présente étude porte sur l'évaluation des effets environnementaux dans le cadre de grands projets ayant une incidence sur les milieux aquatiques au Canada. L'évaluation des effets environnementaux vise la protection de l'intérêt du public pour ce qui est de l'utilisation rationnelle des ressources. On arrive généralement à des compromis sur une base locale pour chaque projet. Tous sont en faveur des concessions mais peu en font. Tous les projets passent par diverses étapes en commençant par de vagues plans. Certains se cristallisent comme propositions fermes, puis passent par l'évaluation, la construction et la période d'application. En tant que processus, l'évaluation des effets environnementaux devrait réfléter ce schème d'activité au lieu de n'être que la préparation d'énoncés sur les projets imminents.

AB  - The estimation of flow quantiles and the regionalization of hydrologic characteristics are two major foci of current hydrologic research. A flow-duration curve represents the annual flow-frequency characteristics of rivers by depicting the cumulative frequencies for average ranked flows in a river. Generally the process requires the empirical estimation of the mean flow at each of 365 ranks. A model requiring only five parameters is developed by combining the principles of order statistics and traditional flow-frequency analyses and is applied to flow-duration curves for rivers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Results from the model may be interpreted both statistically and physically and allow the identification of hydrologically similar regions. Streamflows in British Columbia are generated from a number of distinct physical processes operating in highly diverse environments. The mixture of the streamflow-generating processes requires that the statistical model be capable of encompassing the different flow-frequency regimes. Identification of hydrologic regions also depends on the inclusion of these generating processes. The model presented incorporates the physical generating processes of streamflow in both the statistical representation of flow-duration curves and their interpretation. Similarly, the spatial model presents hydrologic regions that correspond to the known physical environment.

AB  - The paper deals with the electrical aspects of the NechakoÂ¿KemanoÂ¿Kitimat hydro-electric power development and the associated aluminium-reduction works in the province of British Columbia, Canada. After briefly presenting the physiographic setting and civil-engineering features of the world's largest underground power development, with an ultimate installed capacity of 2,240,000 h.p., the paper discusses the outstanding features of many elements of the power development wherein new engineering ground has been broken. The unusually heavy electrical loading of the 300-kV transmission system is treated at some length, as well as the mechanical loading. In addition, the plant power-supply features of what will ultimately be the largest aluminium-reduction works in the world, at Kitimat, are discussed. The paper presents comparative data on the characteristics of such equipment as the impulse turbines, generators, main step-up and step-down transformer banks, and 300-kV power cables, derived from the tenders of the several manufacturers supplying the equipment.

AB  - Contemporary Indigenous activism asserts an agency for place not normally found in geographical scholarship. Through place-based protest, organizing, and direct action, Native and non-Native people are interacting with place as a conscious being with the capacity to speak, create, and teach the responsibilities required for more inclusive forms of coexistence in today’s settler states. This “placework” articulates a more-than-human geographical self whose subjectivities are grounded in, and accountable to, land-based relationships and knowledges. Placework contributes to a geographical posthumanism that offers a distinctively Indigenous approach to the predicaments of the Anthropocene.

AB  - Although the importance of aboriginal knowledge, values and perspectives in sustainable development has been recognised for many decades, worldwide examples exist showing that aboriginal involvement is less then effective. How and where to include aboriginal needs and goals has however been problematic. Ultimately, aboriginal forest values need to be considered with scientific strategies and their role and compatibility with forest conditions needs to be explored. Criteria and indicator (C&amp;I) frameworks can be used as a platform to include community needs and goals in management decisions. This review compares aboriginal forest ecological perspectives defined by Canadian local level C&amp;I frameworks with non-aboriginal local level C&amp;I frameworks to identify their differences at the indicator level. Three major themes mark the differences between aboriginal and non-aboriginal indicators: (1) aboriginal frameworks introduce ecological indicators of cultural importance; (2) there is an aesthetic concern for forest operations especially if they affect cultural owners; and (3) indicators regarding the access to resources are more complex and include the sustainability of the productivity, proximity, integrity and quality of resources used in traditional activities. Results show that First Nation forest sustainability issues are in effect a combination of forest conditions and values. Inclusion of forest values in C&amp;I frameworks is necessary because: (1) aboriginal communities do not dissociate culture from the environment and thus forest values from forest condition, (2) they have an impact on resulting forest management strategies and decisions, and (3) they offer a holistic approach to sustainability issues and a better picture of local environmental contexts.

AB  - Canadian research on contemporary erosion and sedimentation processes covers a wide range of scales, processes, approaches and environmental problems. This review of recent research focuses on the themes of sediment yield, land-use impact, fine-sediment transport, bed material transport and river morphology and numerical modelling of fluvial landscape development. Research on sediment yield and denudation has confirmed that Canadian rivers are often dominated by riparian sediment sources. Studies of the effects of forestry on erosion, in-stream sedimentation and habitat are prominent, including major field experimental studies in coastal and central British Columbia. Studies of fine-sediment transport mechanisms have focused on the composition of particles and the dynamics of flocculation. In fluvial dynamics there have been important contributions to problems of turbulence-scale flow structure and entrainment processes, and the characteristics of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. Although much of the work has been empirical and field-based, results of numerical modelling of denudational processes and landscape development also have begun to appear. The nature of research in Canada is driven by the progress of the science internationally, but also by the nature of the Canadian landscape, its history and resource exploitation. Yet knowledge of Canadian rivers is still limited, and problems of, for example, large pristine rivers or rivers in cold climates, remain unexplored. Research on larger scale issues of sediment transfer or the effects of hydrological change is now hampered by reductions in national monitoring programmes. This also will make it difficult to test theory and assess modelling results. Monitoring has been replaced by project- and issues-based research, which has yielded some valuable information on river system processes and opened opportunities for fluvial scientists. However, future contributions will depend on our ability to continue with fundamental fluvial science while fulfilling the management agenda. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Issues related to company-community relations and the social license to operate have emerged as strategic business issues. This paper aims to contribute to the growing body of research on long-term company-community relations. An analysis of the relationship between Alcan (Aluminum of Canada, Montréal, Canada part of Rio Tinto since 2007) with the Cheslatta Carrier First Nation in the Kemano-Kitimat area of northern British Columbia, Canada, provides three contributions. The first is related to the notion of relational legacy, which refers to the sedimentation of unresolved issues that have the potential to impede the realization of corporate activities and the reproduction of low levels of social license to operate. The second concerns stakeholder management. While the literature suggests that stakeholders should be managed by companies according to the degree of salience, this analysis suggests that researchers and managers should consider the evolution of the environmental context in their analyses. Third, the analysis suggests that small or marginalized groups, depicted by the stakeholder management literature as dormant stakeholders, should not be underestimated.

The most common taxa were Diphyllobothrium sp. (spp.?) plerocercoids, Philonema agubernaculum, Eubothrium sp., and Proteocephalus sp. Various statistical techniques (K - nearest neighbour and cluster analyses based on Jaccard and percent dissimilarity matrices) were used to compare the parasite fauna in sockeye from the different lakes. K - nearest neighbour analysis demonstrated that considerable overlap existed among many of the studied lakes, whereas little overlap occurred among other lakes. Cluster analyses revealed similar faunas among some lakes within biogeoclimatic zones and lakes of similar trophic status.

AB  - In 1979, 1-0 container-grown and 2-0 bareroot lodgopole pine, Pinus contorta var latifolia (Engelm.), seedlings were planted on 20 winter landings using conventional and soil-auger planting techniques. Seedling survival and growth were assessed at the end of the first and fifth growing seasons and compared with the growth of naturally regenerated lodgepole pine seedlings on the adjacent cutover areas. Foliar nutrient content, soil bulk density, and soil nutrient pool were also compared between the two areas.Auger planting significantly improved early survival of bareroot stock but had no effect on initial survival rate of container-grown seedlings. The planting method had no significant effect on subsequent growth of either stock type. However, growth of seedlings that were planted on the landings was significantly poorer than that of natural regeneration on the adjacent cutovers. Higher soil density and a significantly reduced soil nutrient pool contributed one third and two thirds, respectively, to this observed growth reduction. Such results suggest that some form of site rehabilitation should be considered if planted trees are to reach their full growth potential on these landings.

Records include fish from many lakes and streams of the Columbia and Fraser drainages and from a few localities in the Skeena, Peace, Liard and Skagit drainages. Parasites are recorded for each species of fish from each locality. The incidence of parasitism in the fish was comparable with that found by other surveys in eastern Canada and the United States. No major differences were found in the parasite faunas of the different river systems. Most of the common parasites were forms of circumpolar or general North American distribution. Several species of parasites described only from the Pacific coast area were common in certain hosts. Introduced species of fish showed very light infections with but few species of their normal parasites. The parasite fauna of fishes of this area appears to be less varied than in eastern and southern parts of the continent., non disponible

Larvae were sampled 8, 16, and 24 days post-hatch. Larvae were larger when reared with substrate and at warmer temperatures. For whole body cortisol, a significant age by temperature interaction was observed with the highest values on day 16 for larvae from warm water treatments. Larvae reared in gravel consistently showed significantly lower whole body cortisol than larvae reared without substrate. In response to mechanical agitation, there was a significant effect of time following disturbance. Increased growth and reduced stress hormone levels make substrate rearing of yolksac larvae an important technique for enhancement efforts in artificial and natural environments. The positive effects of temperature on growth, however, with higher whole body cortisol, suggest that larval white sturgeon development may be better at cooler temperatures.

AB  - This paper presents a study describing the effect of various hydrological variables in stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) for solving the optimization problem of managing a hydropower system. We will show how choosing the best hydrological variables can strongly affect management policies. This is especially true for the system studied here, namely the Kemano hydroelectric system located in British Columbia, Canada, which is subject to large streamflow volumes due to significant snow cover during winter. Real-time snow water equivalent (SWE) data can be used directly as a variable in SDP management policies. Results indicate that for the system in this study, the maximum SWE (i.e., highest level of SWE observed from the start of winter to the current decision period) is the best among the methods investigated for effective, safe management, compared with Markov or order p autoregressive models when forecasts are not available., Cet article présente une étude décrivant l’effet de diverses variables hydrologiques de la programmation stochastique dynamique (SDP) pour résoudre le problème d’optimisation pour gérer un système hydroélectrique.

AB  - The Carrier First Nations, who are the original inhabitants of North Central British Columbia, have endured years of hardship as a result of European colonization. Over time, this has resulted in an erosion of traditional practices and a decline in overall health. There is concern that mental health practitioners are not meeting the needs of the Carrier people because they fail to understand the Carrier worldview. In an effort to better understand and respect the Carrier ideas and beliefs about mental health and mental illness, interviews were conducted with 7 traditional healers about their beliefs and their practices. The traditional healers reported that the concept of mental illness did not exist in pre-contact culture. However, the traditional healers who participated in this research actively practise ceremonies and rituals that seek to restore balance and harmony between the person and his or her environment.

AB  - Over the past several decades, a substantial amount of research has examined how cardiorespiratory physiology supports the diverse activities performed throughout the life cycle of Pacific salmon, genus Oncorhynchus. Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.

AB  - This paper considers a mathematical programming model for the management of a salmon fishery and watershed. Management objectives are specified as bounds and desirable target levels for certain important variables. The mathematical program consists of minimizing the deviation from these targets subject to natural and policy constraints. A detailed application studying the effect of the proposed Kemano II development project on the salmon fisheries of northwestern British Columbia is presented. Parametric programming is used to compare several development scenarios on the basis of the sensitivity of the system to reduce runoff in a specified year. Key words: mathematical models, fishery management, Pacific salmon, sensitivity analysis, experimentation, policy planning, Nous examinons dans le présent article un modèle de programmation mathématique applicable à la gestion d'une pêcherie de saumons et à l'aménagement de son bassin hydrographique. L'établissement de limites et de niveaux désirables pour certaines variables importantes est considéré comme un objectif spécifique de la gestion. Le programme mathématique consiste à réduire au minimum l'écart entre cibles et variables, compte tenu des contraintes naturelles et politiques. Nous présentons une application détaillée en étudiant les effets du projet Kemano II d'expansion des pêches de saumons dans le nordouest de la Colombie-Britannique. Nous servant d'une programmation paramétrique, nous comparons plusieurs scénarios d'expansion fondés sur la sensibilité du système à réduire le ruissellement en une année particulière.

AB  - The Intermontane Belt of the Canadian Cordillera has long been viewed as a passive, relatively rigid block between two metamorphic-plutonic belts, the Coast Plutonic Complex and the Omineca Belt. However, the Skeena Fold Belt, which spans most of the width of the northern Intermontane Belt, exhibits shortening comparable with that in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. The Skeena Fold Belt has many features of thin-skinned fold and thrust belts, such as thrust faults which sole into a detachment, a wide variety of structural styles which depend on rock type, a foreland basin which was cannibalized by continued deformation, a frontal triangle zone, and a hinterland of metamorphic and plutonic rocks (Coast Plutonic Complex). The Skeena Fold Belt thus is comparable with the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt, but rather than deforming a continental terrace wedge, it developed in a terrane (Stikinia) which had accreted to North America in the early Mesozoic, and in Jurassic and Cretaceous clastic successions (Bowser Lake and Sustut groups) which overlie Stikinia. Structural and stratigraphic relationships show that the earliest deformation occurred between Oxfordian and Albian time and that the last folds developed in latest Cretaceous or early Tertiary time. As much as 160 km of northeastward shortening in the Skeena Fold Belt was broadly contemporaneous with crustal thickening in the Coast Plutonic Complex and Omineca Belt, with dextral strike-slip faulting east of the Skeena Fold Belt, and with shortening in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. Therefore, between latest Jurassic and early Tertiary times, horizontal shortening occured across most of the width of the northern Canadian Cordillera. Concurrent shortening across the Cordillera suggests that a common detachment (or detachments) fed all of these zones as far east as the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt.

AB  - Spirituality and sexuality marked moral boundaries on the North American colonial frontier. Images of women's bodies and presumptions about female morality were central signifiers of relative stages of "civilization." Images created in the seventeenth century endure and persist in dividing aboriginal womanhood into the dichotomous and harmful categories of "princess" and "squaw." The continuing appeal of Pocahontas myths reveals the power of these images to affect contemporary understandings of morality and gender. This article considers the contemporary implications of frontier constructs of female sexuality and spirituality. If colonial and postcolonial relations are conceptualized as an enduring "im/moral" frontier, issues of spirituality and sexuality can be understood as complex negotiations of meaning that reflect changing power relations. Contemporary aboriginal women, metaphorical granddaughters of Pocahontas, confront their spiritual transformations in diverse ways. In central British Columbia they have done so alongside the move to beatify a former student of a residential school.

AB  - Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning habitat. Information exists on the microhabitat characteristics that define suitable salmon spawning habitat. However, traditional spawning habitat models that use these characteristics to predict available spawning habitat are restricted because they can not account for the heterogeneous nature of rivers. We present a conceptual spawning habitat model for fall chinook salmon that describes how geomorphic features of river channels create hydraulic processes, including hyporheic flows, that influence where salmon spawn in unconstrained reaches of large mainstem alluvial rivers. Two case studies based on empirical data from fall chinook salmon spawning areas in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River are presented to illustrate important aspects of our conceptual model. We suggest that traditional habitat models and our conceptual model be combined to predict the limits of suitable fall chinook salmon spawning habitat. This approach can incorporate quantitative measures of river channel morphology, including general descriptors of geomorphic features at different spatial scales, in order to understand the processes influencing redd site selection and spawning habitat use. This information is needed in order to protect existing salmon spawning habitat in large rivers, as well as to recover habitat already lost.

AB  - In Dakelh (Carrier), as in many other Athapaskan languages, valence prefixes and “inner subject” prefixes interact in a complex pattern involving a combination of consonant deletion and/or fusion and, in certain conditions, what looks like epenthesis. In this paper we investigate this apparent epenthesis effect, which is otherwise unexpected in this environment in Dakelh and is problematic in several aspects (Gessner 2003). We propose that the epenthesis should be understood as an anti-homophony effect (Crosswhite 1999, Blevins 2004a, b) serving to systematically maintain a surface distinction between paradigmatically related forms differing in valence. We demonstrate how the anti-homophony effect is best understood in a diachronic-evolutionary context rather than a synchronicphonological one: “epenthesis” is really the blocking of syncope (as a regular historical sound change). The account constitutes a striking parallel to the explanation of so-called antigemination effects as the result of syncope blocking through homophony avoidance, as proposed by Blevins (2004a, b).

This study applies literature-derived indicators to examine urban change in the city of Prince George; British Columbia's northern capital. Findings illustrate that key growth nodes have largely performed (e.g., densified) at or below the level of their surrounding neighbourhood over time despite a robust set of policy tools associated with smart growth. This research is one of few to examine smart growth in a northern urban context, and situates the concept within the slow growth/no growth realities of many rural and remote regions.

AB  - Objectives Meaningful social engagement is important to reduce risk for social isolation and loneliness. First Nations Elders are a unique group and little knowledge currently exists of their preferred forms of social interaction. The objective of this study was to describe the types of programs Nak'azdli Elders desire, identify barriers to participation, and improve creation of programs that address Elders' needs and interests. Methods This project was co-created by the Nak'azdli Health Centre and Elders, located in Northern British Columbia, with support from academic partners when and where asked. An advisory committee selected participants perceived as able to complete the survey and available for interviewing. Participants were interviewed orally in English or Carrier in their homes or at a drop-in centre, by a well-respected Nak'azdli Elder. The Elder entered participant responses (including self-reported health, awareness and utilization for existing programs, and preferences for new programs) into a paper-based survey. Descriptive and content analysis were conducted. Results Nak'azdli Elders (N = 38) were interested in wisdom sharing, social programs, and health-related activities. Elders wanted to be actively engaged in programs/activity selection, helping organize programs, knowledge sharing, skills, and stories. Barriers to participation included lack of transportation, personal health concerns, scheduling conflicts, and lack of knowledge about programs/activities. Conclusion Nak'azdli Elders were interested in culturally relevant programs involving sharing cultural knowledge, teachings, and/or language with younger generations. Elders wanted to be engaged in all stages of activities, including planning, participation, and evaluation. Future programs should prioritize community collaboration and co-creation with Elders.

AB  - This article examines the implications and limitations of First Nations forestry negotiations in British Columbia (BC), Canada by assessing how effectively the Tl'azt'en Nation is able to realize benefits under the current form of negotiations. The primary goal of the Tl'azt'en Nation has always been to defend their Aboriginal interests within their ancestral lands, which would entail the cessation of clear-cutting on their traditional territory. Although the community has pursued some economic opportunities in the forestry sector to improve their socioeconomic conditions, despite their efforts, the socioeconomic status of the community remains unchanged. The collective experience of the Tl'azt'en Nation illustrates that simply obtaining certain forest tenures and short-term-based revenue sharing agreements does not adequately meet their forestry and self-sufficiency goals. Without addressing the fundamental issues and challenges facing the community, the current practice of forestry negotiations between the Provincial government and the Tl'azt'en Nation has produced no significant benefits to the community.

AB  - Snow‐dominated watersheds are bellwethers of climate change. Hydroclimate projections in such basins often ﬁnd reductions in annual peak runoff due to decreased snowpack under global warming. British Columbia's Fraser River Basin (FRB) is a large, nival basin with exposure to moisture‐laden atmospheric rivers originating in the Paciﬁc Ocean. Landfalling atmospheric rivers over the region in winter are projected to increase in both strength and frequency in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models. We investigate future changes in hydrology and annual peak daily streamﬂow in the FRB using a hydrologic model driven by a bias‐corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (8.5), the FRB evolves toward a nival‐pluvial regime featuring an increasing association of extreme rainfall with annual peak daily ﬂow, a doubling in cold season peak discharge, and a decrease in the return period of the largest historical ﬂow, from a 1‐in‐200‐year to 1‐in‐50‐year event by the late 21st century. Plain Language Summary:Snow‐covered areas of the globe are particularly sensitive to global warming. Future projections using global climate models generally show that as the ratio of snow to rain declines, river ﬂows peak earlier in the year with reduced volume. These models also capture the phenomenon of “atmospheric rivers”: long, meandering plumes of water vapor often originating over the tropical oceans that bring sustained, heavy precipitation to the west coasts of North America and northern Europe. The present‐day frequency of landfalling atmospheric rivers on the Canadian west coast is projected to increase nearly fourfold by the late 21st century, with a proportionate increase in extreme rainfall events. Our work is the ﬁrst to directly investigate the impact of these “rivers in the sky” on “rivers on the land” using climate model projections. Focusing on the Fraser River Basin, Canada's largest Paciﬁc watershed, and using a business‐as‐usual industrial emissions scenario, we show that the basin transitions from one where peak ﬂow results from spring snowmelt to one where peak ﬂow is often caused by extreme rainfall. Our modeling suggests that extreme rainfall events resulting from atmospheric rivers may lead to peak annual ﬂoods of historic proportions, and of unprecedented frequency, by the late 21st century in the Fraser River Basin.

The context is the history of segregation of Indigenous peoples and settlers in Canada. Is there a decolonizing role for planning, beginning with the work of healing and reconciliation? And, is there a role for film as a methodological tool in such a process? Our findings suggest a very necessary role for therapeutic planning, albeit with caveats; and, that film can be an effective catalyst for creating this therapeutic space.

AB  - PHABSIM, part of the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology, was used to predict the spawning habitat used by chinook salmon in a 600 m long section of the Nechako River, British Columbia, Canada. Predictions of the model were compared to the location and amount of habitat actually used by adult chinook salmon in 1974, 1980, and 1986. About 3800 m2 (70 per cent) of the spawning area actually used by the population were predicted as unusable by the ‘best’ prediction, while 87 per cent of the area predicted as usable has never had recorded use. The ‘best’ prediction resulted from using close transect spacing, frequent measurements along the transect, river-specific habitat suitability criteria, and modelling habitat at the fish's position near the stream bottom. Depending upon the spacing of the transects and the habitat suitability criteria used, PHABSIM predicted 210 per cent to 660 per cent more spawning habitat was available than historically had ever been used. Chinook salmon in the Nechako River spawn mainly on the upstream face of dunes, therefore, the assumption in PHABSIM that conditions predicted at the transects remain unchanged upstream and downstream part way to the adjacent transects was false. This assumption resulted in about two-thirds of the correct predictions being made for the wrong reason. The accuracy of PHABSIM's predictions for spawning might be improved by incorporating an index of river bottom topography or velocity gradient into the model.

AB  - The winter diets of northern mule deer are comprised predominantly of shrubs and trees. Included in winter diets are various species of conifers, some of which are important forestry and ornamental crop trees. Diet choices and feeding habits of mule deer utilizing conifer crops, however, have not been widely reported. Here, we document diet choices made by human-habituated mule deer from north central British Columbia during an exploratory cafeteria-style feeding trial using boughs of thirteen species of native North American and introduced European conifers. Mule deer consumed more biomass from exotic conifers (specifically pine) than from rarely encountered native conifers, and consumed the least biomass from those native conifers commonly encountered by deer in northern BC, a finding which appears to lend support to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis. From most to least biomass consumed, deer selected Mugho pine, Scots pine, western hemlock, subalpine fir, Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Ponderosa pine, western white pine, lodgepole pine, common juniper, red cedar, black spruce, and hybrid white spruce. Analysis of Variance testing suggested that deer preferred to eat exotic Mugho and Scots pine and avoided eating commonly encountered, native black and hybrid white spruce. A relationship also existed between the biomass consumed and the number of bites taken by deer from each species, which generally indicated that deer took more bites from exotic and rarely encountered conifers, but not always. Our results suggest that northern mule deer, therefore, may be more likely to damage introduced pine and other exotics relative to native species planted in either ornamental or forest plantation settings when deer densities are high and/or browse resources are limited.

AB  - We examine the importance of stream habitat characteristics in governing variation in spawning densities of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) across 32 streams in the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia, Canada. We used mixed-effects models to examine four competing hypotheses for the influence of abiotic stream characteristics acting on either adult salmon or embryo mortality. All models that received support using Akaike’s information criterion included stream characteristics that are associated with cover. These included the percent area of pools, percentage of the banks that were undercut, and large woody debris (in that order). These results suggest the importance of stream characteristics, which reduce risk of predation on adults, in determining spawning sockeye salmon densities. Thus, identification of a small number of physical characteristics of streams provides insight into ecological processes that determine population densities. This information can be used to quantify habitat quality, whic...,

AB  - The Omineca Crystalline Belt of the Canadian Cordillera is flanked on the west by the Hinterland Belt, characterized by folds and faults that show predominant westward directed tectonic transport. Rocks involved in northern and central British Columbia comprise the Cache Creek Group and, to the west, various Permian, Triassic and Jurassic units. The structures in this belt record three major episodes of deformation. Earliest folds in the Cache Creek Group probably reflect latest Triassic deformation and cannot be related to the Hinterland Belt for they trend obliquely to it. In northern and central British Columbia the Hinterland Belt as a structural entity was produced by probable latest Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous deformation. Major east-dipping thrust and reverse faults, associated locally with folds and schist terranes, bring Cache Creek strata over and against coeval and younger rocks to the west.

AB  - Remains of a partially articulate mammoth skeleton were exposed during stripping operations at a mining site on Babine Lake, central British Columbia. The bones lay in silty pond deposits in a bedrock depression, and were overlain by a thin layer of gravel and a thick layer of glacial till. Although no molar teeth were found, limb proportions show that the specimen was a large mammoth, like the Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus cf. M. columbi). Two radiocarbon dates of 42 900 ± 1860 yr B.P. and 43 800 ± 1830 yr B.P. on wood from the silty fossiliferous layer, and another of 34 000 ± 690 yr B.P. on mammoth bone suggest that the animal sank in sticky pond deposits and died there. Paleobotanical evidence indicates that, during this part of the Olympia Interglaciation, the vegetation near Babine Lake was similar to present shrub tundra just beyond the treeline in northern Canada., Les ossements d'un squelette de mammouth partiellement articulé ont été découverts au cours du décapage d'affleurements à un site minier du lac Babine au centre de la Colombie Britannique.

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that decrease gene flow between diverging populations is critical to understanding speciation. Anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn sympatrically and interbreed, yet allele frequency differences at neutral loci indicate restricted gene flow. Disruptive natural selection associated with strong selective differences between anadromous and nonanadromous life histories is thought to maintain the genetic differentiation of the morphs. Recently, a putative third morph of O. nerka exhibiting green rather than red breeding colour has been found on the spawning grounds sympatric with sockeye and kokanee. We investigated the ancestry of these green fish in a 2-year controlled breeding study by using previously documented heritable, countergradient variation in red breeding colour to distinguish pure and hybrid morphs. Stabilizing sexual selection for similar red breeding colour in sockeye and kokanee has led to adaptive differences in the efficiency of carotenoid uptake between the morphs given differences in carotenoid availability between marine and lacustrine habitats. On the same diet, offspring parented by the green fish were intermediate in colour and in the concentration of dietary carotenoid pigments in their flesh and skin to those parented by either sockeye or kokanee; they were most similar to those parented by known kokanee × sockeye hybrids. This countergradient variation in carotenoid use results in a genotype-environment mismatch in nonanadromous hybrids that exposes them by their breeding colour on the spawning grounds. Given that red colour is important in mate choice, sexual selection will almost certainly reduce reproductive opportunities for these hybrids and promote sympatric divergence of these incipient species. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 84, 287–305.

AB  - This study compared fecundity-length-latitude relationships between 25 kokanee populations (15 natural and 10 introduced) and 48 sockeye salmon populations. Significant differences confirmed the hypothesis that the two Oncorhynchus nerka variants follow different reproductive strategies: (i) fecundity is more highly correlated with length for kokanee than for sockeye salmon; (ii) kokanee have higher fecundity-length regression slopes and lower intercepts than sockeye salmon; (iii) kokanee populations share a common fecundity-length regression slope, but sockeye salmon populations do not; and (iv) average lengths and fecundities of kokanee decrease with increasing latitude, but those of sockeye salmon do not. The first three findings confirm that kokanee maintain a constant egg size while increasing egg number with increasing body size but that sockeye salmon increase both egg number and egg size with increasing body size. Kokanee egg sizes may be less variable than those of sockeye salmon because kokanee ..., J'ai comparé les relations fécondité-longueur-latitude chez 25 populations de Saumons rouges non anadromes (15 naturelles et 10 introduites) et 48 populations de Saumons rouges anadromes. Des différences significatives confirment l'hypothèse selon laquelle les deux formes de Oncorhynchus nerka ont des stratégies de reproduction différentes : (i) la fécondité est en corrélation plus étroite avec la longueur chez la forme non anadrome; (ii) chez la forme non anadrome les pentes de régression fécondité-longueur sont plus fortes et l'ordonnée à l'origine est plus basse; (iii) chez toutes les populations de saumons non anadromes, mais pas chez les anadromes, la droite de régression fécondité-longueur a toujours la même pente; (iv) chez les saumons non anadromes mais pas chez les anadromes, la longueur et la fécondité moyennes diminuent à mesure que la latitude augmente.

AB  - In recent years, a buoyant global market for minerals has led to renewed interest in the mining sector as a means of generating economic growth in resource producing areas of developed nations. The development of new operations, however, raises concerns around the impacts of mining activities on the environment, health and traditional ways of life of Indigenous peoples. Using the proposed expansion of the Kemess mine in northern British Columbia as a case study, this paper examines two First Nations’ perspectives regarding the regulatory process through which environmental values may be validated and protected, and seeks to understand how these First Nations’ environmental values and perceptions of risk are connected to health and well-being. Sixteen key informant interviews were carried out and thematically analyzed through political ecology and environmental justice frameworks. The paper argues that accommodating First Nations’ environmental values and perceptions of risks is a necessary first step to reclaim health and well-being in politically marginalized settings.

AB  - In 2002, the Carney Hill neighbourhood in Prince George, British Columbia, was identified as the highest risk neighbourhood in the province for healthy child development. This paper describes the community development efforts underway since 1992 to create a positive healthy neighbourhood for residents of all ages. A review of literature explores First Nations traditional value and belief structures, the concept of integrative planning, theories of social learning and principles of community sustainability. Concepts of social capital are reviewed and the concept of sustainability capital is introduced. A case study approach is used to explore the community development process, identify positive and negative elements within the neighbourhood and to suggest methods and activities to aid in the facilitation of positive changes within the neighbourhood. Finally, ideas to integrate First Nations values and beliefs and relevant concepts of environmental sustainability within the development process are discussed.

AB  - ABSTRACT: We analyzed the distribution of HLA class II alleles and haplotypes in one Na-Dene (Athabaskan) group from British Columbia (Canada) by PCR amplification of the DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 second exon sequences. We extended the typing of the DRB1 in an Amerindian group (Penutian) from British Columbia. The presence of the alleles DRB1∗ 0405, ∗0407 and ∗0410 only in Na-Dene and alleles DRB1∗0408, ∗1301∗1302, ∗1304, ∗1305, ∗1502 and ∗1601 only in Amerindians suggests separate origins of these two groups. There were fifteen different DRB1/DQA1/DQB1 haplotypes. One unique haplotype previously reported in Native Americans was found. Thirty-four per cent of Athabaskans presented Native American haplotype DRB1∗1402/DQA1∗0501/DQB1∗0301. In addition, the results of this study are compatible with previous evidence with mitochondrial (mtDNA) polymorphisms indicating that Amerindians and Na-Dene populations derived from different migrations from Asia.

AB  - To understand links between substrate and recruitment of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), I evaluated the effects of substrate condition on larval drift, hiding, and predation between hatch and 15 days posthatch (dph). Over porous substrates (small gravel = 1.2–1.9 cm; medium gravel = 2.5–5.0 cm; cobble = 10–15 cm), rapid interstitial hiding was observed from 0 to 6 dph at low water velocity (4 cm·s–1), whereas larvae drifted in response to nonporous substrates (sand < 0.2 cm; embedded cobble). Velocities of 20 cm·s–1 led to significantly lower drift only at 1 dph over small gravel. Hiding occurred an average of 2.0–13.3 s after release at 0–6 dph. Predation by sculpins (Cottus spp.) on larval sturgeon also decreased significantly in response to porous substrates at 1 dph. The strongest expression of increased hiding and decreased predation when small gravel was available suggests that yolksac larvae prefer small interstitial spaces created by that substrate. Considering behavioural responses in ..., Afin de comprendre les liens entre le substrat et le recrutement chez l’esturgeon blanc (Acipenser transmontanus), les effets de la condition du substrat sur la dérive, la dissimulation et la prédation des larves depuis l’éclosion jusqu’à 15 jours après l’éclosion (dph) ont été évalués. Sur les substrats poreux (gravier fin = 1,2–1,9 cm; gravier moyen = 2,5–5,0 cm; galets = 10–15 cm), on observe une dissimulation rapide dans la zone interstitielle de 0 à 6 dph à vitesse de courant faible (4 cm·s–1), alors que sur les substrats non poreux (sable < 0,2 cm; galets encastrés), les larves dérivent. Les vitesses de courant de 20 cm·s–1 produisent une diminution significative de la dérive seulement à 1 dph sur du gravier fin.

The results indicated definite antimicrobial activity in the pitch preparations of Picea glauca and Pinus contorta and provide a starting point for pharmacognostic evaluation of these species. In addition, cytoxicity assays, to test the anticancer activity of methanolic extracts of Alnus incana and Shepherdia canadensis against mouse mastocytoma cells, were shown to be positive.

AB  - We studied the spatial pattern and physical characteristics of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) redds with respect to length of redd occupancy and when redd construction began. Spawners arriving first deposited their eggs in larger redds constructed in deeper, slower moving water. Redds constructed by late arriving fish were smaller on average and were usually located in relatively shallow, fast-flowing water. Late arriving fish also had a shorter average redd residence time. We suggest that progeny of early arriving spawners may have a selective advantage over progeny of late arriving fish in the same run., On trouvera ici une étude sur la répartition spatiale et les caractéristiques physiques des nids de saumons chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) en fonction de la durée de l'occupation du nid et du moment où a commencé la construction du nid. Les premiers reproducteurs arrivés pondent leurs œufs dans des nids plus grands, construits en eau plus profonde et à courant plus lent. Les nids des poissons qui arrivent plus tard sont en moyenne plus petits et sont construits en eau relativement peu profonde à courant rapide; ces poissons occupent en moyenne leurs nids moins longtemps que les premiers arrivants. Il est probable que la progéniture des premiers arrivants soit avantagée par rapport à la progéniture des poissons arrivés plus tard au cours de la même saison.[Traduit par le journal]

AB  - There has been a great deal of controversy recently in British Columbia over the non-Canadian use of the province's recreational resources. Tourism is British Columbia's third largest industry, yet tourist facilities, especially publicly provided facilities, have been experiencing crowding problems, which many believe result in deterioration in the quality of the recreational experience. In July, 1973, British Columbia's Minister of Highways responded to this situation by advocating a ban on all United States' recreational vehicles.In the present paper the problems of recreational resource development are subjected to economic analysis. One group of non-Canadian users, namely, sport fishermen, is singled out for attention. The consequences of various relevant recreation policies are discussed on a regional basis, drawing on a selection of studies undertaken by the Northern Economics Unit, Federal Fisheries Service, in Vancouver.The conclusions of the paper are as follows. It is evident that public attitudes towards non-resident use of locally identified recreational resources vary significantly from one region to another.Overcrowded conditions prevailing in some areas are not evident in others and policies must be flexible enough to take account of regional variation. Furthermore, excess demand is often a reflection of inconsistent government policies which produce a gap between the planned utilisation and the planned provision of facilities. Under such conditions discrimination on the basis of residential status is likely to be carried to lengths beyond those justified by economic analysis. In particular, in the case of British Columbia, to focus attention on restricting non-Canadian use is to divert attention away from the real problem. In the final analysis, if governments are concerned with providing an optimal amount of good quality recreational opportunities and maximising the real net benefits accruing to residents under their jurisdictions, then a policy package more finely attuned to these objectives is necessary.

AB  - Nazko cone, located in central British Columbia at the eastern end of the Anahim Volcanic Belt, is the product of at least three episodes of Quaternary volcanic activity. An eroded Pleistocene subaerial flow at the base of the pile is overlain by a subglacial mound of hyaloclastite that is, in turn, partly covered by a younger composite pyroclastic cone and associated lava flows. A whole-rock K–Ar date of 0.34 ± 0.03 Ma on the oldest flow is consistent with a hotspot model for the Anahim Belt and implies absolute late Neogene motion of 2.6 cm/year for North America. The hyaloclastite mound was erupted beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps during the Fraser Glaciation (25 000 – 10 000 years BP). Radiocarbon dates from peat above and below Nazko tephra in a bog near the cone suggest that the volcano last erupted about 7200 years BP.Nazko basalt has 10–15% normative nepheline and is classified as basanite. This is significantly more undersaturated than basalts farther west in..., Le cône de Nazko, localisé à l'extrémité orientale de la zone volcanique d'Anahim, en Colombie-Britannique centrale, doit son existence à au moins trois épisodes d'activité volcanique durant le Quaternaire.

La plus ancienne coulée fournit un âge K–Ar sur roche totale de 0,34 ± 0,03 Ma, s'accordant avec un modèle de point chaud pour la zone d'Anahim et impliquant, au Néogène tardif, un mouvement absolu de 2,6 cm/an pour l'Amérique du Nord. Le monticule d'hyaloclastite a été engendré par une éruption sous-jacente à l'inlandsis de la Cordillère durant le Pléistocène tardif, peut-être durant la glaciation Fraser (25 000 – 10 000 ans Av.P.).

AB  - Uniformity of water quality in the Upper Fraser River basin was examined using cluster analysis. Substantial variations in water quality exist within the basin. These differences are largely related to the geology of the watersheds. Differences in water quality were more pronounced among the tributaries than along the mainstem of the Fraser River. The mainstem of the river could be considered to have three distinct reaches where water quality properties were relatively constant. Cluster analysis was a useful technique for establishing similarities and differences for both the tributaries and the mainstem stations. Some limitations of water quality data and the methods used are discussed. The diversity of water quality found to exist within this basin suggests that uniform criteria or objectives cannot be applied to the basin as a whole, but may be applied to smaller units.

AB  - The high topographic relief and physiographic diversity of British Columbia make it a particularly difficult region in which to consider the potential of global environmental change to affect lake and stream habitats important for freshwater sportfish production. More importantly these provincial features intensify problems in predicting the magnitude and sometimes even the direction of such effects. Nevertheless a number of useful models are available to help predict these changes acting through alterations in stream discharge and periodicity, ice-free period, water temperature, epilimnial depth and volume, dissolved oxygen level and hypolomnetic depletion rate, all of which are major determinants of sportfish habitat quality and quantity. Not surprisingly there is great regional difference in the direction and severity of probable effects of global environmental change within the province — in some areas negative and in others positive. These are reviewed and suggestions made regarding management policies required to meet their challenge.

AB  - This paper reviews the geographic extent, distribution, plant communities, forage productivity and animal production of Crown range in British Columbia. Over 10 million ha of Crown range is distributed among 11 biogeoclimatic zones. Forestland comprises nearly 80% of the landbase grazed. In the southern interior, the most important zones include the Bunchgrass, Ponderosa Pine, Interior Douglas-Fir and Montane Spruce zones. Forage yields vary from as much as 2700 kg ha−1 on grassland to < 100 kg ha−1 under dense forest canopy. On seeded clearcuts, however, production may exceed 1500 kg ha−1. Average daily gains for steers and calves on forest range vary from 0.8 to 1.1 kg d−1. In the central interior and Peace River areas, the Sub-Boreal Pine–Spruce, Sub-Boreal Spruce and Boreal White and Black Spruce zones provide most of the forage for beef cattle. Seventeen community pastures, comprising nearly 170 000 ha, produce almost 50 000 animal-unit months (AUMs) of forage for cattle in this region. Forage produc..., L'article passe en revue l'étendue géographique, la répartition, les communautés végétales, la productivité fourragère et la production animale dans les terres de l'État en Colombie-Britannique (C.-B.). Plus de 10 millions d'hectares (ha) de parcours de l'État se répartissent entre 11 zones biogéoclimatiques. La forêt couvre près de 80% du territoire pâturé. Dans le sud de l'intérieur, les zones les plus importantes sont la zone à graminées cespiteuses, la zone du pin Ponderosa, la zone du Douglas de l'intérieur et la zone montagnarde à épinette. Le rendement fourrager peut aller de 2700 kg ha−1 sur prairie à moins de 100 kg ha−1 sous couvert forestier dense.

AB  - ConclusionsThe widespread, explosive eruption of acid volcanic rocks in the early Tertiary represents a unique event in the Phanerozoic history of the Canadian Cordilleran orogen. It coincides with a period of general uplift during which the central part of the former eugeosyncline was subjected to tensional stresses resulting in rifting and block faulting accompanied by submissive intrusion of epizonal, acid plutons. Both the plutons and the acid volcanic rocks are considered to be products of the same magma. Periodic escape of gas from the tops of large magma chambers was accompanied by intense shattering of the roof rocks and expulsion of great volumes of gas-charged magma which produced the thick piles of welded tuff and ignimbrite that characterize the early Tertiary Sloko succession.The area underlain by the early Tertiary acid volcanic rocks coincides with that of the Whitehorse-Nechako Trough, a belt of prolonged subsidence in which the greatest thickness of eugeosynclinal sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated through most of Mesozoic time. This fact, plus the predominance of acidic rather than basic lavas and plutons in the early Tertiary of British Columbia, suggests that these rocks originated from primary anatectic magma rather than acid magma derived through differentiation of a more basic parent.

AB  - Basic components of predation processes are briefly reviewed and data on these components are presented for several native Indian food fisheries. Depensatory mortality emerges as a common effect of these fisheries, which supports findings of earlier workers on Skeena River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Native food fisheries therefore operate like natural "Type II" predators, and descriptive equations are provided for use by salmon managers and modelers.Key words: fishermen as predators, native, Indian, food, fisheries, salmon, depensation, L'auteur fait une brève revue des éléments de base de la prédation et présente, pour plusieurs pêcheries de subsistance pratiquées par les Indians, des données sur ces éléments. Comme effet commun de ces pêcheries, émerge une mortalité anticompensatoire, ce qui confirme les observations de chercheurs qui avaient déjà étudié le saumon nerka (Oncorhynchus nerka) de la rivière Skeena. Les pêcheries de subsistance des Indiens agissent donc comme prédateurs naturels de «type II», et on donne des équations descriptives pouvant être utilisées pour la gestion et l'élaboration de modèles de pêcheries de saumons.

AB  - Immediately after emergence from spawning gravels, fry of stream-type chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations from tributaries of the upper Fraser River, British Columbia, distribute themselves downstream from the spawning areas, throughout the natal stream, and into the Fraser River. We tested the hypothesis that this range in dispersal distances is caused by innate differences in nocturnal migratory tendency among individuals. Using an experimental stream channel, we found repeatable differences in downstream movement behaviour among newly emerged chinook fry. Fish that moved downstream were larger than those that held position in the channel. However, the incidence of downstream movement behaviours decreased over the first 2 weeks after emergence. We propose that the variation among individuals in downstream movement behaviour we observed leads to the dispersal of newly emerged fry throughout all available rearing habitats. Thus, between- and within-population variation in the freshwater ..., Immédiatement après l'émergence des lits de gravier des frayères, les alevins de saumon chinook de cours d'eau (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) appartenant aux populations des tributaires du cours supérieur du fleuve Fraser, en Colombie-Britannique, se dispersent en aval des aires de frais, dans l'ensemble du cours d'eau natal et dans le fleuve Fraser. Nous avons vérifié l'hypothèse que cette gamme de distances de dispersion soit attribuable à des différences innées dans les tendances migratoires nocturnes chez les individus. En utilisant un chenal de cours d'eau expérimental, nous avons observé des différences répétées dans le comportement de déplacement en aval chez les alevins de saumon chinook nouvellement émergés. Les poissons qui se sont déplacés vers l'aval étaient de taille plus grande que ceux qui sont demeurés sur place dans le chenal. Cependant, l'incidence des comportements de déplacement vers l'aval a diminué au cours des deux premières semaines suivant l'émergence. Nous estimons que la variation o...

AB  - An evaluation of how coarse woody debris (CWD) changes in quantity and quality during stand development was conducted using a 426-year chronosequence of 71 stands in sub-boreal forests in British Columbia. Additional characteristics of CWD were determined in 14 of the stands. Most stands are fire initiated and input from the predisturbance stand is critical in controlling the amounts and characteristics of CWD within young stands. Log volume declines from over 100 m3/ha in young stands (0-50 years) to just over 60 m3/ha in stands from 51 to 200 years old, and then increases to greater than 140 m3/ha in the oldest (>= 400-year-old) stands. Mean snag basal area is highest (31.6 m2/ha) in young, postfire stands, decreases to a very low value (2.0 m2/ha) in stands 51-100 years old, and then reaches a second maximum (12.1 m2/ha) in stands that are 201-250 years old; it declines slightly in very old stands.

AB  - An extensive but generally thin mantle of basalt flows, the Chilcotin Group, covers much of the Interior Plateau of south-central British Columbia. It provides material for dating and for reconstructing the original form of the paleosurface on which it was deposited. K–Ar whole-rock dates demonstrate that several ages of basalt are represented, from Early Miocene (or even Late Oligocene?) to Early Pleistocene, with particularly abundant eruptions about 14–16, 9–6, and 1–3 Ma ago.Basalts of Middle Miocene and later ages, if not the Early Miocene relics as well, clearly rest on land surfaces of low local relief. In places the low-relief surfaces had been incised to depths of 100–200 m and the valleys backfilled with mid-or late Cenozoic sediments prior to burial by the basalts. The low-relief surfaces throughout the area are believed to have been developed close to a common base level, and regional differences in their present elevation are thus largely a product of post-basalt deformation. This is recorded..., Un manteau de coulées de basalte, étalé sur une grande superficie, généralement de faible épaisseur, recouvre la majeure partie du plateau Intérieur du centre-sud de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces basaltes ont été datés, et le paléorelief sur lequel repose ce manteau de basaltes a été reconstitué. Les datations K–Ar sur roche totale révèlent la présence de plusieurs coulées d'âge différent, partant du Miocène précoce (ou même Oligocène tardif?) jusqu'au Pléistocène précoce, et avec des éruptions particulièrement abondantes datées à 14–16, 9–6 et 1–3 Ma.Les basaltes d'âge miocène moyen ou plus récent, n'excluant pas les coulées résiduelles d'âge miocène précoce, reposent nettement sur des surfaces de terrain à faible relief local. En certains endroits, les surfaces de faible relief furent érodées pour former des vallées de 100–200 m de fond, comblées ultérieurement par des sédiments d'âge cénozoïque moyen à tardif et ensuite recouvertes à leur tour par les coulées de basalte.

AB  - To estimate the parameters that govern mass- and temperature-dependent growth, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing growth data from juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that were fed an ad libitum ration of a pelleted diet. Although the growth of juvenile Chinook Salmon has been well studied, research has focused on a single population, a narrow range of fish sizes, or a narrow range of temperatures. Therefore, we incorporated the Ratkowsky model for temperature-dependent growth into an allometric growth model; this model was then fitted to growth data from 11 data sources representing nine populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon. The model fit the growth data well, explaining 98% of the variation in final mass. The estimated allometric mass exponent (b) was 0.338 (SE = 0.025), similar to estimates reported for other salmonids. This estimate of b will be particularly useful for estimating mass-standardized growth rates of juvenile Chinook Salmon. In addition, the lower thermal limit, optimal temperature, and upper thermal limit for growth were estimated to be 1.8°C (SE = 0.63°C), 19.0°C (SE = 0.27°C), and 24.9°C (SE = 0.02°C), respectively. By taking a meta-analytical approach, we were able to provide a growth model that is applicable across populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon receiving an ad libitum ration of a pelleted diet.Received May 20, 2014; accepted December 4, 2014

AB  - This paper examines the ontological politics of an encounter between proposed energy pipelines and Indigenous peoples. The Enbridge Corporation has applied to construct a pipeline system to deliver diluted bitumen from the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, but the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and their member communities have asserted the authority to prevent this project from passing through their unceded territories. Studying Carrier Sekani contestation of Canadian regulatory assessment of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project, we examine how the processes of Indigenous becoming exceed notions of Indigenous being that are included in the permitting process as traditional knowledge. We focus both on the performance of legal obligations to consider Aboriginal traditional knowledge and the emerging politics of Carrier Sekani resistance. Our intention is not to question the integrity of traditional knowledge that the regulatory process incorporates, but to highlight how traditional knowledge functions as an anchor for a field of governmental inquiry and action. Providing a historical and geographical context of Carrier Sekani relations with development and the state, we argue that the coding of Indigenous being as traditional works to disavow contemporary processes of Indigenous becoming that are surplus to the spatial ontology of capitalist energy development for global markets. Against efforts to sanction development on disputed territory through formal recognition of a constrained Indigeneity, Carrier Sekani people assert the sovereign authority to prevent or permit development on their lands and waterways using traditional governance systems. Broadly, this paper suggests that recognizing the ontological politics at stake in this permitting process provides a useful opening to understand continued colonial captures at work in the inclusion of traditional knowledge in environmental governance. But it also demonstrates the capacity of Indigenous resistance to these enclosures to challenge and reshape global geographies of energy, capitalism, and climate.

AB  - This paper evaluates an innovative two-tiered model of collaborative planning designed to increase participation of First Nations in resource and environmental planning in British Columbia, Canada. Like a one-tiered model, the two-tiered model engages stakeholders in face-to-face negotiations to develop a consensus plan. However, to finalize an agreement, recommendations from the first tier are then sent to a second tier of negotiations that includes only two parties – First Nations and the provincial government. This innovative two-tiered collaborative process was designed to meet the unique position of First Nations and address the problem of low First Nations participation in previous single-tiered collaborative planning processes. Results based on 26 evaluative criteria indicate the two-tiered process was successful in increasing First Nations engagement while still meeting the interests of non-aboriginal stakeholders who did not participate at the second tier of negotiations. However, results also indicate a need to revise the two-tiered process to improve buy-in from non-aboriginal stakeholders while continuing to respect First Nations' constitutional rights. With these revisions, results suggest that a two-tiered collaborative planning model is a viable option worthy of consideration for cases in which one or more participants, such as aboriginal populations, have unique rights and interests that need to be accommodated in the process design.

In doing so, Tl'azt'en First Nation encountered challenges that reverberate today for indigenous peoples seeking timber rights in Canada. The authors demonstrate that considerable tensions exist between traditional First Nations values and the values of a commercial forestry operations and that finding reconciliation between these different values is not easy. Tl'azt'en Nation's experiences suggest several key factors for communities to consider and address in undertaking forestry operations that meet indigenous community values and goals. Further, forest companies looking to work with First Nations should understand some of the concerns First Nation communities are faced with in planning for community supported forestry operations.

AB  - Abstract Integrated river basin management (IRBM) is an approach that has been interpreted in a number of different ways during the last 100 years. Current support for IRBM is based on a ‘myth’ of inter‐agency co‐ordination. However, increasing complexity and uncertainty in river basin systems has created ‘wicked’ or ‘messy’ land and water management problems. The limited capacity of state institutions to deal effectively with such conditions suggests that the current ‘myth’ must be reformed and that a more powerful system‐response capability founded on inter‐organisational collaboration should be developed. The case for a collaborative institutional approach to IRBM is examined with reference to the Fraser Basin Council in British Columbia, Canada.

AB  - Rural and small town places in developed economies are aging. While attention has been paid to the local transportation needs of rural seniors, fewer researchers have explored their regional transportation needs. This is important given policies that have reduced and regionalized many services and supports. This article explores mobility constraints impeding rural seniors' access to regionalized services using the example of northern British Columbia. Drawing upon several qualitative studies, we explore geographical, maintenance, organizational, communication, human resources, infrastructure, and financial constraints that affect seniors' regional mobility. Our findings indicate that greater coordination across multiple government agencies and jurisdictions is needed and more supportive policies and resources must be in place to facilitate a comprehensive regional transportation strategy. In addition to discussing the complexities of these geographies, the article identifies innovative solutions that have been deployed in northern British Columbia to support an aging population. This research provides a foundation for developing a comprehensive understanding of the key issues that need to be addressed to inform strategic investments in infrastructure and programs that support the regional mobility and, hence, healthy aging of rural seniors.

AB  - Abstract Calls for community forestry on public forests grew in strength in both British Columbia and the United States during the 1990s, as part of a global movement touting the advantages of community control over centralized state administration of forests. Despite structural similarities, the trajectories of community forestry in the two locations diverged sharply, with community forests rapidly becoming a reality in British Columbia while similar proposals in the United States were blocked. This article explains these divergent trajectories by examining the differences in property relations, state institutions, stakeholder interests, and environmental social-movement strategies that led to nearly opposite outcomes in initially similar situations. It also analyzes community forestry in British Columbia relative to current debates over neoliberalism and alternative economies, arguing that detailed examination of such empirical examples demonstrates the utility of neoliberalism as an analytical concept.

AB  - This paper presents a modelling study on the spatial and temporal variability of climate-induced hydrologic changes in the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada. This large basin presents a unique modelling case due to its physiographic heterogeneity and the potentially large implications of changes to its hydrologic regime. The macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model was employed to simulate 30-year baseline (1970s) and future (2050s) hydrologic regimes based on climate forcings derived from eight global climate models (GCMs) runs under three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2). Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation was used to statistically downscale GCM outputs to the resolution of the VIC model (1/16°). The modelled future scenarios for the 11 sub-basins and three regions (eastern mountains, central plateau and coastal mountains) of the FRB exhibit spatially varied responses, such as, shifts from snow-dominant to hybrid regime in the eastern and coastal mountains and hybrid to rain-dominant regime in the central plateau region. The analysis of temporal changes illustrated considerable uncertainties in the projections obtained from an ensemble of GCMs and emission scenarios. However, direction of changes obtained from the GCM ensembles and emissions scenarios are consistent amongst one another. The most significant temporal changes could include earlier onsets of snowmelt-driven peak discharge, increased winter and spring runoff and decreased summer runoff. The projected winter runoff increases and summer decreases are more pronounced in the central plateau region. The results also revealed increases in the total annual discharge and decreases in the 30-year mean of the peak annual discharge. Such climate-induced changes could have implications for water resources management in the region. The spatially and temporally varied hydro-climatic projections and their range of projections can be used for local-scale adaptation in this important water resource system for British Columbia.

Relevant scholarship highlights the importance of these factors for achieving success with any community economic development (CED) initiative. While the initial experiences of 10 community forest initiatives under British Columbia's Community Forest Pilot Project offers evidence to corroborate this view, it is also evident that expertise and leadership, even of the exclusive variety, can substitute for community support and participation, if the goal of CED is to create a profitable community enterprise capable of delivering jobs and revenues to community members.

AB  - An inventory of provincial lakes and reservoirs has been developed to characterise and assess the distribution and morphometry of standing water bodies in British Columbia. In the province, there are over 241,500 lakes and reservoirs greater than 1,000 m2in size. These water bodies cover 2.37 percent of the province area and contain an estimated 521 km3of water (312 km3in natural lakes and 209 km3in reservoirs). A hypsometric relation suitable for order-of-magnitude estimates of lake volume from lake area is presented. Based on the distribution and morphometric attributes of lakes, several distinctive limnologic regions were identified, including the northeastern Alberta Plateau (highest proportion of circular lakes), the southwestern Alberta Plateau (lowest lake density/coverage and highest proportion of irregularly shaped lakes) and the Milbanke Strandflat (highest density of lakes). Observed regional and scale-related patterns in lake distribution/morphometry appear to be largely related to geomorphic controls, particularly tectonic and glacial history. Large-scale hydrologic implications of these standing water bodies and potential ecosystem/water resource management applications of the provincial inventory are also discussed.

Eyeflukes in other salmonids were considered to be the same species based on similar measurements and site in the eyes. These eyeflukes varied in prevalence and mean intensity in seven salmonid species surveyed in nine localities in 1979–1981. The following fish were sampled: rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), 505; mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), 334; lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), 32; Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), 66; lake trout (S. namaycush), 13; kokanee or sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), 323; and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), 164. Eyeflukes had prevalences ranging from 84 to 100% in six lakes, 64% in the river, 53% in one reservoir site, and a prevalence of 15% in the other reservoir site. Mountain and lake whitefishes had high mean intensities while kokanee had low mean intensities.

AB  - To determine use of riparian habitats by birds in the northern coniferous forest of British Columbia, we censused birds and vegetation along 500 m transects placed parallel and perpendicular to three second-order streams. Censuses were conducted during spring, summer, autumn, and winter to investigate how use of riparian habitat changed seasonally. Stream-side riparian zones were characterized by a dense understorey of deciduous vegetation not found in the upslope forest. Nine bird species preferred the riparian understorey for breeding, six preferred it only during migration. Neotropical migrants (16 of 46 species) were more closely associated with stream-sides than year-round residents (11 species). Some breeding birds (five species) were significantly negatively associated with riparian habitats. The density of riparian birds declined with distance upstream but did not decline up to 250 m away from the stream. The more extensive riparian areas downstream supported a greater density of birds in all seasons compared to upstream areas, but more species only in spring and autumn. Species that nested in non-riparian areas in summer used riparian habitat in autumn, making riparian corridors in the northern coniferous forest important during migration. Maintaining both riparian and upslope habitats is necessary to preserve species diversity al the landscape level.

AB  - This article explores the potential for building capacity to plan and develop ecotourism in a traditionally forest-dependent indigenous community in central British Columbia (BC), Canada. It is based on fieldwork conducted in 2001 and 2002, consisting mainly of two community workshops, and a survey of 128 Tl'azt'en Nation households. Results show that there is significant potential for ecotourism development in the Tl'azt'en territory. The Tl'azt'en have a strong desire to be involved in ecotourism; however, they are incognisant of the challenges and opportunities that come with its development. There is a general lack of commitment to a shared responsibility in the planning and management of ecotourism. Four potential obstacles to fully realise the development of ecotourism include the speculation that most commercial ‘niches’ are already filled; lack of clearly identified target visitor markets; competing interests from other northern BC communities that have similar resources; and stereotypical images of First Nations in Canada. The article suggests several strategies, including the capitalisation of Tl'azt'enne knowledge of the resources, building networks with other aboriginal and non-aboriginal agencies and individuals, exploring opportunities for educating and training the youth in tourism and small enterprise development, and building partnerships with tour operators.

AB  - British Columbia's energy policy is at a crossroads; the province has set a goal of electricity self-sufficiency, a 93% renewable portfolio standard and a natural gas development strategy that could increase electricity consumption by 21 TWh to 33 TWh. To ascertain the BC's supply position, a mathematical programming model of the physical workings of BC's hydroelectric generating system is developed, with head heights at the two dominant power stations treated as variable. Using historical water inflow and reservoir level data, the model is used to investigate whether BC is capable of meeting its self-sufficiency goals under various water supply and electricity demand scenarios.

AB  - This paper addresses the means by which the government of Canada is fulfilling its fiduciary obligation to consult with Aboriginal communities whose traditionally used lands are subject to industrial development. Specifically, the use of Aboriginal land use studies, as a means of consultation, is called into question on the basis of methodological limitations and cultural misrepresentation. In closing, it is suggested that until the Canadian government is prepared to take a proactive stance in mitigating land use conflicts through an effective and equitable consultative framework one should expect an escalation of litigation and continued Aboriginal discord.

AB  - Riprap, consisting of large boulders or concrete blocks, is extensively used to stabilize streambanks and to inhibit lateral erosion of rivers, yet its effect on river morphology and its ecological consequences have been relatively little studied. In this paper, we review the available information, most of it culled from the “grey” literature. We use a simple one-dimensional morphodynamic model as a conceptual tool to illustrate potential morphological effects of riprap placement in a gravel-bed river, which include inhibition of local sediment supply to the channel and consequent channel bed scour and substrate coarsening, and downstream erosion. Riprap placement also tends to sever organic material input from the riparian zone, with loss of shade, wood input, and input of finer organic material. Available information on the consequences for the aquatic ecosystem mainly concerns effects on commercially and recreationally important fishes. The preponderance of studies report unfavorable effects on local numbers, but habitat niches created by openings in riprap can favorably affect invertebrates and some small fishes. There is a need for much more research on both morphological and ecosystem effects of riprap placement.

AB  - Recent improvements in forecast skill of the climate system by dynamical climate models could lead to improvements in seasonal streamflow predictions. This study evaluates the hydrologic prediction skill of a dynamical climate model–driven hydrologic prediction system (CM-HPS), based on an ensemble of statistically downscaled outputs from the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS). For comparison, historical and future climate traces–driven ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) was employed. The Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) hydrologic model setup for the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada, was used as a test bed for the two systems. In both cases, results revealed limited precipitation prediction skill. For streamflow prediction, the ESP approach has very limited or no correlation skill beyond the months influenced by initial hydrologic conditions, while the CM-HPS has moderately better correlation skill, attributable to the enhanced temperature prediction skill that results from CanSIPS’s ability to predict El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its teleconnections. The root-mean-square error, bias, and categorical skills for the two methods are mostly similar. Hydrologic modeling uncertainty also affects the prediction skill, and in some cases prediction skill is constrained by hydrologic model skill. Overall, the CM-HPS shows potential for seasonal streamflow prediction, and further enhancements in climate models could potentially to lead to more skillful hydrologic predictions.

AB  - A new, image-based, tritiated ligand technique for measuring cardiac β2-adrenoceptor (β2-AR) binding characteristics was developed and validated with adult rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss hearts so that the tissue limitation of traditional receptor binding techniques could be overcome and measurements could be made in hearts nearly 14-times smaller than previously used. The myocardial cell-surface (functional) β2-AR density of O. nerka smolts sampled at the headwaters of the Chilko River was 54·2 fmol mg protein−1 and about half of that previously found in return migrating adults of the same population, but still more than twice that of adult hatchery O. mykiss (21·1 fmol mg protein−1). This technique now opens the possibility of investigating cardiac receptor density in a much wider range of fish species and life stages.

AB  - A new species of Eubothrium is described from northern squawfish from lakes in northern British Columbia. Morphologically, Eubothrium tulipai differs from other Eubothrium species in the shapes of the scolex, ovary, and cirrus sac. The new species differs from E. rugosum and E. salvelini, the two other freshwater species located in the Fraser drainage system, in the protuberant, powerful bothria, small, round apical disk, and constricted cirrus sac. Biologically it differs further from the two species in parasitizing a cyprinid host and is probably specific to cyprinid fish in British Columbia.,

The present research is a collaborative project between Tl'azt'en Nation (located in northcentral British Columbia, just north of Fort St. James) and the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). The objectives of the study were to collect Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to gain an understanding of the criteria for gathering individual plants for food or medicine use, and to understand why traditional plant gathering sites may fall out of use. Multiple methods were used to gather information from knowledgeable Tl'azt'enne community members including focus groups, interviews, and field trips. Community members possess deep understandings of plants and their gathering sites. People’s concerns include the loss of TEK and changing landscapes due to the effects of disturbances on their lands. The knowledge gathered and documented throughout the study can be used to promote the preservation of the culture and language of Tl'azt'en Nation

AB  - The bias correction of climate model outputs is based on the main assumption of the time invariance of thebias, in which the statistical relationship between observations and climate model outputs in the historicalperiod stays constant in the future period. The present study aims to assess statistical bias correction undernonstationary bias conditions and its implications on the simulated streamﬂow over two snowmelt-drivenCanadian catchments. A pseudoreality approach is employed in order to derive a proxy of future observa-tions. In this approach, CRCM–ECHAM5 ensemble simulations are used as pseudoreality observations tocorrect for bias in the CRCM–CGCM3 ensemble simulations in the reference (1971–2000) period. The cli-mate model simulations are then bias corrected in the future (2041–70) period and compared with the futurepseudoreality observations. This process demonstrates that biases (precipitation and temperature) remainafter the bias correction. In a second step, the uncorrected and bias-corrected CRCM–CGCM3 simulationsare used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model in both periods. The biascorrection decreases the error on mean monthly streamﬂow over the reference period; such ﬁndings are moremixed over the future period. The results of various hydrological indicators show that the climate changesignal on streamﬂow obtained with uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is similar in both its magnitudeand its direction for the mean monthly streamﬂow only. Regarding the indicators of extreme hydrologicalevents, more mixed results are found with site dependence. All in all, bias correction under nonstationary biasis an additional source of uncertainty that cannot be neglected in hydrological climate change impact studies.

AB  - Projected climate change effects on streamflow are investigated for the 2041–2070 horizon following the SRES A2 emissions scenario over two snowmelt-dominated catchments in Canada. A 16-member ensemble of SWAT hydrological model (HM) simulations, based on a comprehensive ensemble of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) simulations driven by two global climate models (GCMs), with five realizations of the Canadian CGCM3 and three realizations of the German ECHAM5 is established per catchment. This study aims to evaluate, once model bias has been removed by statistical post-processing (SP), how the RCM-simulated climate changes differ from those of the parent GCMs, and how they affect the assessment of climate change-induced hydrological impacts at the catchment scale. The variability of streamflow caused by the use of different SP methods (mean-based versus distribution-based) within each statistical post-processing pathway of climate model outputs (bias correction versus perturbation) is also evaluated, as well as the uncertainty of natural climate variability. The simulations cover 1971–2000 in the reference period and 2041–2070 in the future period. For a set of criteria, results based on raw and statistically post-processed model outputs for the reference climate are compared with observations. This process demonstrates that SP is important not only for GCMs outputs, but also for CRCM outputs. SP leads to a high level of agreement between the CRCM and the driving GCMs in reproducing patterns of observed climate. The ensemble spread of the climate change signal on streamflow is large and varies with catchments and hydrological periods (winter/summer flows). The results of various hydrological indicators show that most of the uncertainty arises from the natural climate variability followed by the statistical post-processing. The uncertainty linked to the choice of statistical pathway is much larger than that associated with the choice of the method in quantifying the hydrological impacts. We find that the incorporation of dynamical downscaling of global models through the CRCM as an intermediate step in the GCM–RCM–SP–HM model chain does not lead to considerable differences in the assessment of the climate change impacts on streamflow for the study catchments.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to trace community and regional responses to the economic downturn of 2008/2009 in Northern British Columbia, Canada. Our research during this period (2009–2011), the Northern Economic Vision II (NEV II) project, sought to investigate whether communities in the region were incorporating some of the core findings, lessons from an earlier project, the NEV I project (conducted in 2002–2005), in terms of preparing for both economic uncertainty and opportunity through place-oriented community planning and enhanced regional collaboration. Findings suggest that in the face of economic hardship, many communities continued to pursue community and regionally-oriented strategies in an attempt to preserve services and quality of life for local residents, and did not engage in reactive budget cuts in the face of economic decline, as experienced in previous bust periods.

AB  - Adaptation has lagged behind mitigation in climate change research and action, and there are currently few examples of proactive community adaptation plans in Canada or around the world. However, adaptation is being increasingly recognized as a necessary action to respond to changes in the climate as societies concurrently mitigate to minimize future anthropogenic climatic forcing. Environmental planners will play a leading role in assisting communities as they face the challenge of preparing for a changing and uncertain future. This research uses a self-assessment survey and workshop to provide a perspective of planner knowledge of climate change adaptation. It also explores climate impacts in communities across the province of British Columbia, Canada, and barriers to effective adaptation. The results indicate that planners do not have a high level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The top impacts that planners believe will affect British Columbia are related to forests, agriculture and river flooding. Planners want adaptation incorporated into existing documents (such as community, regional and provincial plans) rather than separate adaptation plans. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to promote capacity building related to climate change adaptation among planners.

AB  - This article proposes a three-part framework for accounting for the physical and social components of place as a system in community adaptation to crisis. While ideas of place have been incorporated into research on social and community resilience and adaptation, the existing work tends to focus on sense of place or place attachment. Generally, it does not account for the roles of place character or infrastructure. This article develops a novel three-part framework—incarnate, discarnate, and chimerical place—to provide a richer description of how place acts a system to inform social adaptation to crises, and specifically how it informs community resilience or transformation. This framework is demonstrated through case studies of two forest-dependent communities in British Columbia, Canada, adapting to local mill closures.

The article argues that the cultural, organizational, and systemic transformations necessary to address the deep and ongoing health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations should be rooted in Indigenous knowledges and should prioritize Indigenous voices, values, and concepts. Cultural safety, ethical space, and Two-Eyed Seeing are three examples of ideas anchored in Indigenous knowledges that speak to relationships at the interface of different systems of knowledge. We offer some examples of how a public health knowledge translation centre and a regional health service delivering organization are actualizing these concepts in their work nationally and regionally in northern British Columbia, Canada.

AB  - Both birds and plants are major components of the world's biocultural diversity. Salient species of both are recognized and named in virtually every language and both feature in countless ways in people's systems of knowledge, practice, and belief, as sources of food, materials, and medicines, and as ceremonial and religious symbols. However, these two major biological groups are also linked together, and their ecological associations are likewise reflected in cultural knowledge systems. In northwestern North America, there are many examples of the intersection of botanical and ornithological knowledge, reflected in people's vocabulary, narratives, belief systems, and management practices. Here we provide diverse illustrations of this intersection in cultural knowledge of plant-bird associations. These examples link together observations of bird habits and habitats with particular plant species and show how this complex integrated knowledge and experience has helped promote cultural richness and well-being for First Peoples of the region. Bird species from swans (Cygnus spp.) to hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and plants from edible root vegetables to nectar-producing flowers are exemplified as major representatives of ethnoecological connections. These relationships remind us of the importance of interspecies ties to environmental and cultural integrity—a key to sustainable living into the future.

AB  - Fine sediment derived from catchment erosion can adversely impact aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies of lake sediment deposits in western Canada attributed increased sedimentation to land use; however, high catchment variability and short- and long-term climatic responses complicated the interpretation of those regional records. We compiled a large inventory of lake catchment data transecting the Canadian cordillera that comprised 210Pb-based profiles of deposition, GIS-based land use records, and interpolated climate change data. We used these data and mixed-effects modeling to relate sedimentation trends to land use and climate change since the mid-20th century. Although sedimentation was highly variable, increasing trends in accumulation corresponded with cumulative land use and, to a lesser degree, with climate change. Road density was the most important variable, but the inclusion of timber harvesting density further improved model fits significantly. Land use effects were more difficult to discern for the easternmost region of the Alberta Plateau where sedimentation appeared to be cumulatively associated with both timber and energy resource extraction. Stronger relations were obtained with whole catchment (0.50–273 km2) measures of land use, suggesting that fine sediment is efficiently transferred from hillslopes to the lake basins. While accounting for land use, a climate signal was also detected with improved model fits obtained with the inclusion of catchment warming. Further modeling results suggest that at least one critical control of reconstructed sedimentation remains undetermined. Interdecadal rates of lake sedimentation in western Canada have steadily increased during the late 20th century, following patterns of regional environmental change.

AB  - Community-based research (CBR) represents a particularly timely approach to rural research. Rural areas in industrialized nations are undergoing dramatic and rapid processes of economic, social and political restructuring. These forces, combined with a trend towards place-based development and territorial policy make CBR an appropriate rural method given its flexibility and sensitivity to local context. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the use and methods of CBR in the rural setting, drawn from our collective research experience in northern British Columbia. There has been increased attention paid to CBR, signalling a form of acceptance within the academy towards community-based and participatory methods. However, gaps exist in addressing the various approaches to conducting CBR and in considering the relevance of CBR in different contexts. Researchers also note the need for better training in the use of community-based methods. We reflect upon our rural CBR experience to offer insights and pragmatic lessons on effective methodological practices using a simplified framework of the key research process stages: preparing for community engagement, doing community-based research and after the fieldwork.

AB  - Throughout the 1800s and the 1900s, woodland caribou disappeared from much of the central and southern portions of British Columbia, Canada. Conversely, moose populations expanded during the 1900s and rapidly colonized forested areas formerly occupied by caribou. Although the general trend in range recession and expansion is documented, the processes, timing, and spatial extent of overlap between these two ungulates are uncertain. Such details have implications for our understanding of the ecology of these species and the conservation of woodland caribou. Using historical-ecological methods, we documented the distribution and abundance of caribou and moose over a 150-year period. Also, we evaluated three general sources of evidence for documenting long-term changes in the distribution of hunted or trapped fauna: (1) semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents; (2) journals of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC); and (3) primary written sources. The findings of this study suggested that caribou were relatively wide-spread throughout the study area until the late 1800s when their distribution began to decline. The first recorded sighting of moose in the study area was 1832, although consensus among sources suggested that moose expanded into the area at the end of the 1800s becoming abundant in the 1920s and 1930s. Proposed causes of decline of caribou included climatic change during the 1800s and habitat loss, hunting, and altered predator-prey dynamics through the early 1900s. Our analysis of three sources of historical information and knowledge confirmed the value of Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in documenting and explaining long-term historical distribution of hunted species. Alternatively, HBC journals and other written sources provided good temporal specificity, but few recorded locations of caribou or moose. Documenting changes in the long-term distribution of both species can enlighten conservation planning for woodland caribou.

AB  - This article describes the belief in reincarnation held by the contemporary Wet'suwet'en, or Bulkley River Carrier Indians, based on twenty-eight cases investigated using the methods of Ian Stevenson. The Wet'suwet'en cases are compared to the cases I have studied among two neighboring native groups in British Columbia, Canada: the Gitksan to the west and the Beaver to the northeast. The three groups have different beliefs in the possibility of cross-sex and multiple reincarnation which may relate to their differing attitudes towards succession to hereditary titles. However, the concept of reincarnation gives all three groups a similar perspective on personality formation which affects the way children are treated. While cultural patterning shapes the belief in reincarnation, further research is necessary to assess whether something like reincarnation may be actually taking place.

AB  - Using fisheries agency databases and files, we assembled a summary database on the status of anadromous salmon stocks (genus Oncorhynchus) from British Columbia and Yukon streams. We then collected supplementary information by circulating the database among fisheries professionals and interest groups throughout British Columbia and thus identified 9,662 anadromous salmon stocks. These stocks included 866 chinook, 1,625 chum, 2,594 coho, 2,169 pink, 917 sockeye, 867 steelhead and 612 sea-run cutthroat trout stocks. We assessed the status of anadromous stocks by employing a classification scheme similar to that of Nehlsen et al. (1991). Assessments were possible for 5,487 (57%) of all stocks and included all large, commercially important stocks. The assessments found 624 stocks were at high risk, 78 were at moderate risk, 230 were of special concern, and 142 were extirpated in this century. We were unable to classify 4,172 (43%) of the stocks because of an absence of reliable data. Due to their small size, these stocks are not of great commercial importance, although they are important to the maintenance of salmonid diversity. We also identified many potential threats to anadromous salmon stocks. The absence of systematic, high-quality assessments at the biological stock level precluded reliable assignment of the specific causes for many of the stocks apparently at risk. Nevertheless, habitat degradation associated with logging, urbanization, and hydropower development contributed to most of the 142 documented stock extinctions. Furthermore, there is little doubt that overutilization by commercial and recreational fisheries has in many cases resulted in severe stock depressions that, when added to other factors, has put many stocks at risk.

AB  - Aim We assess whether and how datasets collected by the general public, so-called citizen science programmes, can improve biogeographical studies and contribute to large-scale conservation target-setting. Location Worldwide. Methods We first set a general framework highlighting the prerequisites of a relevant dataset for conservation biogeography. We then illustrate how many different citizen science programmes currently running in different countries can be placed within this framework. Results We highlight that citizen science is particularly useful to address issues spanning large temporal and spatial extents. We then show how datasets based on citizen science can be used to investigate major aspects of global change impacts on biodiversity. We further highlight why these programmes are also particularly valuable in developing the preventative and educational component of conservation biogeography. Main conclusions Conservation biogeography requires considerable amounts of data collected over large spatial and/or temporal extents. Beyond increasing technical advances to collect and analyse these data, citizen science seems to be a highly valuable tool in many aspects. However, while citizen science programmes are now popular and increasingly used in several countries, they are lacking in many others. We argue that the development of citizen science programmes should be encouraged as they can both be highly valuable for conservation biogeography and promote the reconnection between people and nature and more generally between people and science.

AB  - Discussion about local decision making tends to overlook rural and remote youth engagement. Resource extractive industries are, however, fixtures in many rural, remote, northern, and Indigenous communities in settler colonial British Columbia, Canada. These industries shape youths' perceived options for social and economic ventures when they are looking towards their futures. By engaging literature on climate change, settler colonialism, and critical Indigenous studies, and drawing on empirics from workshops conducted with youth from northern British Columbia, this paper explores how rural and remote northern and Indigenous youth engagement and perspectives can transform discussions on climate change and resource extraction. The paper documents how rural and northern youth have been engaged in environmental decision making, particularly in light of resource extraction. The paper also suggests that environmental decision making has at times been extractive itself. The paper concludes that when engaged meaningfully, youth desire to work collectively against social and environmental injustices.

AB  - Most of the hydropower generated in Canada’s western province of British Columbia is generated by a small number of large storage or diversion projects that impound large rivers. All but one were built between 1950 and 1985; a period when environmental considerations for large projects were evolving to present-day social, political and regulatory standards. Large projects result in ecosystem transformations; river valleys are converted to reservoirs, and the release of water for power generation results in highly altered flow regimes downstream of dams. I describe the effects of three projects on aquatic ecosystems and measures that have been taken over the past 60 years to monitor and mitigate those effects, with an emphasis on downstream effects to fish populations. I briefly review methods that were used to predict effects, particularly on key fish species, and consider the role of adaptive management and its alternatives on resolving uncertainties about ecological effects of large hydroelectric projects.

AB  - Collaborative governance arrangements involving a diversity of groups (e.g., governments, civil society, industry) are increasingly being used to make decisions or give advice to decision-makers on water issues. Legitimacy is a critical factor for the effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and popular approval of collaborative efforts. However, as a concept, legitimacy remains contested with various meanings, theoretical backgrounds, and source norms. Clarity is particularly needed around the changing sources of legitimacy as collaborative efforts mature. Drawing on case-study research of five collaborations in British Columbia, Canada, we present a framework of legitimacy sources as collaborations evolve. Legitimacy during the establishment of a collaboration depends principally on community readiness to collaborate, a sense of need, and the perceived potential for goal achievement. As a collaboration continues to grow, its legitimacy forms mainly from normative processes—the perceived quality of factors such as accountability, transparency, consensus-building, and representation of relevant discourses. Once a collaboration reaches maturity and faces questions of its future existence, legitimacy is largely result-based—tangible and contextually meaningful outcomes must be easily identifiable and promoted. Increased understanding of the dynamics of legitimacy can help collaborative efforts strategically plan and work toward their goals as they evolve.

AB  - Evaporative flux is a key component of hydrological budgets. Water loss through evapotranspiration reduces volumes available for run-off. The transition from liquid to water vapour on open water surfaces requires heat. Consequently, evaporation act as a cooling mechanism during summer. Both river discharge and water temperature simulations are thus influenced by the methods used to model evaporation. In this paper, the impact of evapotranspiration estimation methods on simulated discharge is assessed using a semidistributed model on two Canadian watersheds. The impact of evaporation estimation methods on water temperature simulations is also evaluated. Finally, the validity of using the same formulation to simulate both of these processes is verified. Five well-known evapotranspiration models and five evaporation models with different wind functions were tested. Results show a large disparity (18–22% of mean annual total evapotranspiration) among the evapotranspiration methods, leading to important differences in simulated discharge (3–25% of observed discharge). Larger differences result from evaporation estimation methods with mean annual divergences of 34–48%. This translates into a difference in mean summer water temperature of 1–15%. Results also show that the choice of model parameter has less influence than the choice of evapotranspiration method in discharge simulations. However, the parameter values influence thermal simulations in the same order of magnitude as the choice of evaporation estimation method. Overall, the results of this study suggest that evapotranspiration and open water evaporation should be represented separately in a hydrological modelling framework, especially when water temperature simulations are required.

AB  - This article explores the resurgence of Indigenous/Palestine solidarity during the Wet’suwet’en land sovereignty struggle in Canada that took place around the same time Donald Trump’s Middle East “peace plan” was released in early 2020. Historicizing this resurgence within a longer period of anti-colonial resistance, the article attends to the distinct historical, political-economic, and juridical formations that undergird settler colonialism in Canada and Israel/Palestine. It contends with the theoretical limits of the settler-colonial framework, pushing back against narratives of settler success, and shows how anti-colonial resistance accelerated economic crises that led both settler states to enter into “negotiations” with the colonized (reconciliation in one case, and peace talks in the other) as a strategy to maintain capitalist settler control over stolen lands. The analysis also sheds light on a praxis of solidarity that has implications for movement building and joint struggle.

AB  - Cities around the world are responding to aging populations and equity concerns for older people by developing age-friendly communities plans, following the World Health Organization's guidelines. Such plans, however, often fail to account for the wide diversity of older people in cities, with the result that some older people, including Indigenous older people, do not see their needs reflected in age-friendly planning and policies. This article reports on a study involving 10 older First Nations and Metis women in the city of Prince George, Canada, comparing the expressed needs of these women with two age-friendly action plans: that of the city of Prince George, and that of the Northern Health Authority. Four main categories were raised in a group discussion and interview with these women at the Prince George Native Friendship Centre: availability of health care services, accessibility and affordability of programs and services, special roles of Indigenous Elders, and experiences of racism and discrimination. There are many areas of synergy between the needs expressed by the women and the two action plans; however, certain key areas are missing from the action plans; in particular, specific strategies for attending to the needs of Indigenous and other older populations who often feel marginalized in health care and in age-friendly planning.

AB  - This article examines the Wet'suwet'en people's struggle for territorial control over their traditional homeland from the normative perspective of collective self-determination. I focus on two interlocking philosophical questions that arise in examination of the case: the justification for a group's right to control territory and the justification for the right of political institutions and officials within those institutions to make and enforce law for the occupants of the territory. I argue that, pursuant to the collective self-determination theory of territorial rights, the legitimate representatives of the Wet'suwet'en people must reflect the people's shared will. After describing the traditional governance system of the Wet'suwet'en people, I argue that there is nothing in principle preventing the hereditary chiefs from reflecting the shared will of the Wet'suwet'en people (as I argue electoral democracy is not always necessary for collective self-determination). I illustrate several reasons why hereditary leaders could reflect the shared will of Wet'suwet'en people better than alternative political authorities, while demonstrating that the political authority of any Wet'suwet'en governance system depends upon the actual endorsement of Wet'suwet'en people themselves.

AB  - Collaborative art is an important kind of "boundary work" in decolonizing relationships to self, others, and land in today's settler societies, or the multinational states that formed as a result of European settler colonialism. This article tells the story of a children's book co-produced by the Cheslatta Carrier Nation in British Columbia and two undergraduate students at the University of Missouri (MU) along with their faculty mentor and his son at the 2018 Cheslatta Camp Out. The Camp Out is a time when the Cheslatta Nation returns to Cheslatta Lake, the homeland from which they were forcibly evacuated in 1952. The process of doing art for the children's book together in place at the Camp Out facilitated the trust and rapport essential for the collaborative creative work, and ultimately helped the participants co-discover the storyline for the book. The co-produced artworks for the children's book (watercolors, photographs, illustrations, stories) became gifts that trace the circuits and complicities of entangled relations. As a gift, artwork brings disparate communities of practice fully into reckoning with place, understood in the Indigenous sense as the relationship of things to each other through land. This is the gift of art, the gift of place.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a non-computational sentiment analysis of the word 'change' on the subject of climate change, local climate innovation and development path change. Results were obtained from interviews conducted with local government officials in 11 communities across British Columbia: Victoria, Vancouver, Prince George, Dawson Creek, North Vancouver, Campbell River, Revelstoke, Surrey, T'Sou-ke First Nation, West Vancouver, and the Kootenay Regional Districts. The sentiment analysis was undertaken to address the lack of agreement among climate researchers and policy-makers over the meaning of change, and to determine whether changes were actually occurring in their development paths. As a result, several drivers and barriers to change were identified at the local government level. Staff quality and horizontal integration were linked to the most positive sentiments, whereas barriers to behavioral change and the limited pace and scale of change were associated with negative sentiments.

AB  - One of the leading features of colonialism is the imposition on a given territory and people a framework for what constitutes authority that renders pre-existing governing practices and legal orders unrecognizable as features of legitimate law and governance. Understood in this way, colonialism renders Indigenous law and governing practices invisible. As a result, decolonization requires changing how authority is apprehended and not only how it is distributed. This article compares two frameworks of authority in relation to the conflict on Wet'suwet'en territory: liberal postcolonial statism and relational pluralism. It shows how each framework provides a distinct lens through which to understand the pertinent features of political authority but argues that relational pluralism presents a better account of how to reconceive political authority in the context of real-world conflict.

AB  - There has been recent controversy over the discrimination between natural and anthropogenic loadings of mercury to lakes. Sediment core profiles have been interpreted as evidence that inputs to lakes have increased. Some investigators have argued, however, that mercury may be sufficiently mobile in sediments to generate profiles that are misinterpreted as historical records. This argument can be tested where the histories of inputs of mercury are known independently from other kinds of information. We have such cases in Canadian lakes and we have been able to assemble sediment core records for comparison with known source histories. Three cases are represented by Clay Lake in Ontario where the source was a chlor-alkali plant with a known history of mercury discharges, Giauque Lake in the Northwest Territories where mercury was used at a gold mine to extract gold from ore, and Stuart Lake in British Columbia where a mercury mine operated for a known period at Pinchi Lake, the lake immediately upstream from Stuart Lake. In these cases lake sediment cores were dated using lead-210 and cesium-137 and then slices were analysed for mercury. The histories of mercury deposition derived from the cores agreed well with the known histories of inputs.

AB  - To determine whether Hg from geologic/mining-related sources at Pinchi Lake (BC, Canada) was causing elevated Hg exposure and/or adversely affecting reproduction in fish-eating birds, breeding bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) on Pinchi Lake and four nearby reference lakes were sampled for blood and feather Hg concentrations and monitored for reproductive success during the summers of 2000, 2001, and 2002. Eggs of red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisgena) also were collected and analyzed. Mercury levels in species at various trophic levels from Pinchi Lake averaged approximately twice those in the same species from nearby lakes combined, even in the absence of substantial new inputs of Hg to Pinchi Lake over several decades. In Pinchi Lake, Hg concentrations in blood and feathers of eagles and eggs of grebes were significantly higher than those in corresponding samples from reference lakes. However, the mean Hg concentration (0.25 microg/g wet wt) in grebe eggs from Pinchi Lake was substantially lower than accepted threshold levels for reproductive toxicity in most avian species (0.5-1.0 microg/g wet wt). Mercury concentrations in the blood of adult eagles and their chicks were highly correlated (r = 0.91, p = 0.004). Despite elevated Hg exposure in adult eagles nesting on Pinchi Lake (blood Hg concentration, 4.3-9.4 microg/ml), birds appeared to be in good body condition, did not differ significantly in terms of weight from eagles nesting on reference lakes, and exhibited no evidence of obvious abnormal behavior or lack of coordination. Eagle reproductive success and productivity on Pinchi Lake were not significantly different from those on all reference lakes combined (p = 0.483).

AB  - A bedload movement detector of novel design was installed in a gravel-bed stream as a component of the ongoing research on sediment transport dynamics in the Stuart–Takla Experimental Watersheds in north-central British Columbia, Canada. The device is designed to collect information on the patterns and timing of bedload transport during a flood event. The device is based on a passive magnetic sensor that produces signals of 10−2 to 10−5 V as its magnetic field is disturbed by passing clasts. A series of 82 sensors is housed in an aluminum beam placed across the stream, inserted such that its surface is flush with the gravel bed. The device can be raised or lowered to compensate for bed aggradation and scour. A data acquisition system gathers voltage signals from the sensors at rates of 30 to 100 Hz. This device is sensitive enough to record the movement of most volcanic, metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic clasts larger than a few millimetres. O'Ne-ell Creek watershed is a 68 km2 tributary basin of the Middle River drainage system in the northern headwaters of the Fraser River. Bedload transport generally occurs twice a year in the Stuart–Takla streams: once during spring floods and again during salmon spawning activity. Bedload moved only during two days in 1998, at the peak of the relatively small nival flood in May. Nevertheless, the device detected at least 3×106 passing clasts. A continuous record of bedload transport was obtained, showing: a pulsating pattern of activity seemingly independent of stage, lateral movement of the transport zone, and a sudden onset of bed movement with a tapered cessation. We anticipate that more sophisticated calibration of the sensors and accelerated sampling rates will provide detailed information on the size and/or velocity and magnetic permeability of particles moving over the device, and will contribute to a better understanding of bedload transport.

AB  - Portions of wood stake salmon fishing weirs have been recorded in the Nautley River of central British Columbia dating from roughly the 13th to early 20th century A.D. The factors contributing to the preservation and detection of these features are considered, along with their spatial arrangement, and it is argued they are the remains of wood fence and basket trap weirs used to harvest sockeye salmon. The early dates and the fact that these features have survived at all have significant implications for interpretations of the development of the ethnographically described salmon focused cultures of this area, and the network of relationships they developed to compensate for cycles in sockeye abundance. It is argued here that weirs are not a result of recent diffusions, and that there is potential for the remains of similar features to be found in other streams of the region, such that long-term cultural adaptations can be better defined.

AB  - Mean summer water temperatures in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) have increased by ∼1.5 °C since the 1950s. In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture–recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival–temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961–1990) and future (2010–2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9–16% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies.

AB  - Sockeye salmon and kokanee, the anadromous and non-anadromous morphs of Oncorhynchus nerka, spawn in close physical proximity in tributaries to Takla Lake, British Columbia but are reproductively isolated and genetically distinct. Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Takla Lake with average densities ranging from 351–558 fish ha-1 in the north arm to 585–769 fish ha-1 in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71–75%) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species.

AB  - Anadromous and nonanadromous morphs of the Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn in close physical proximity in tributaries to Takla Lake, British Columbia, yet differ in morphology, gill raker number, allozyme allele frequencies, and reproductive traits. Both morphs are semelparous typically maturing at age four, the anadromous morph (sockeye) at fork lengths of 38-65 cm and the nonanadromous morph (kokanee) at 17-22 cm. When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye. We conclude that divergence has occurred in sympatry and examine potential isolating mechanisms.

AB  - Insights from both western science and traditional knowledge were applied to identify, and begin to address, climate change and water impacts at Stellat'en First Nation, British Columbia, Canada. Qualitative data from interviews and surveys of Stellat'en community members were compiled and compared with air temperature, precipitation, and hydrometric data from meteorological stations and proximal rivers. Community Elders noted changes to river water levels and shifts in fish populations. The quantitative data revealed a 2.3 °C rise in air temperature, 5 percent increase in precipitation, and 10 percent decline in snowfall over a 40-year period. Results from these analyses were reported in two knowledge intersection workshops at Stellat'en First Nation, and information sharing took place to: facilitate discussion and awareness between traditional and western knowledge holders, gain insights on the community's views of climate change and water, and identify strategies for action. Recommendations formulated and implemented by Stellat'en First Nation include improved policies, and community and individual actions. Les changements climatiques et les ressources en eau dans la Première nation Stellat'en, Colombie-Britannique, Canada : les connaissances issues de la science occidentale et des savoirs traditionnels Le recours aux connaissances issues de la science occidentale et des savoirs traditionnels a permis d'identifier, puis d'aborder les répercussions des changements climatiques sur les ressources en eau dans la Première nation Stellat'en, Colombie-Britannique, Canada. Les données qualitatives obtenues au moyen d'entrevues et d'enquêtes menées auprès de membres de la communauté Stellat'en ont été colligées et comparées à des données de température de l'air, de précipitations et d'hydrométrie recueillies de stations météorologiques et de rivières des environs. Les sages de la communauté ont observé des changements des niveaux d'eau de la rivière ainsi que des variations dans les populations de poissons. Les données quantitatives mettent en évidence une hausse de 2,3 °C de la température de l'air, une augmentation des précipitations de l'ordre de 5 pour cent, et une réduction des chutes de neige de l'ordre de 5 pour cent sur une période de 40 ans. Les résultats qui ressortent de ces analyses ont été présentés au cours de deux ateliers d’échanges sur les savoirs dans la Première nation Stellat'en. Les informations ont ainsi été partagées afin de rendre plus aisées la discussion et la sensibilisation entre les détenteurs de savoirs traditionnels et occidentaux, d'accroître les connaissances sur les opinions de la communauté au sujet des changements climatiques et les ressources en eau, et de fixer des stratégies d'action. L'amélioration des politiques et les actions à l’échelle communautaire et individuelle comptent parmi les recommandations formulées et mises en œuvre par la Première nation Stellat'en.

AB  - A means of determining air emission source regions adversely influencing the city of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada from potential burning of isolated piles of mountain pine beetle-killed lodge pole pine is presented. The analysis uses the CALPUFF atmospheric dispersion model to identify safe burning regions based on atmospheric stability and wind direction. Model results show that the location and extent of influence regions is sensitive to wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric stability and a threshold used to quantify excessive concentrations. A concentration threshold based on the Canada Wide PM2.5 Standard is used to delineate the influence regions while Environment Canada's (EC) daily ventilation index (VI) is used to quantify local atmospheric stability. Results from the analysis, to be used by air quality meteorologists in assessing daily requests for burning permits, are presented as a series of maps delineating acceptable burning locations for sources placed at various distances from the city center and under different ventilation conditions. The results show that no burning should be allowed within 10 km of the city center; under poor ventilation conditions, no burning should be allowed within 20 km of the city center; under good ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed within 10–15 km of the city center; under good to fair ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed beyond 15 km of the city center; and if the wind direction can be reliably forecast, burning can be allowed between 5 and 10 km downwind of the city center under good ventilation conditions.

AB  - Community-integrated undergraduate medical education is becoming a more common option for students predisposed to practice in rural and small town places. One such initiative, the Northern Medical Program, has been operating since 2004 in the northern interior of British Columbia, Canada. The NMP’s curriculum relies heavily on the involvement of practicing physicians in its host community, Prince George. Drawing on Bourdieu’s conceptualization of capital in its different forms, the commitment of the local physician community is understood as social capital derived from cultural capital centred on a collective sense of professional identity forged by conditions of practice in an underserviced area. The ﬁndings of this study are discussed with respect to the long-term operation and success of community-integrated medical education programs.

AB  - Introduction and Aims.The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods.This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14–30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through χ2-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results.Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00–7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53–4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46–4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21–0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion.MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.[Yang J, Oviedo-Joekes E, Christian KWM, Li K, Louie M, Schechter M, Spittal P.

AB  - To address the critical problem of inadequate physician supply in rural British Columbia, The University of British Columbia (UBC) launched an innovative, expanded and distributed medical program in 2004–2005. Medical students engage in a common curriculum at three geographically distinct sites across B.C.: in Vancouver, Prince George and Victoria. The distribution of the core Histology course required a thorough revision of our instructional methodology. We here report our progress and address the question “How does one successfully distribute Histology teaching to remote sites while maintaining the highest of educational standards?” The experience at UBC points to three specific challenges in developing a distributed Histology curriculum: (i) ensuring equitable student access to high quality histological images, (ii) designing and implementing a reliable, state-of-the-art technological infrastructure that allows for real-time teaching and interactivity across geographically separate sites and (iii) ensuring continued student access to faculty content expertise. High quality images—available through any internet connection—are provided within a new virtual slide box library of 300 light microscopic and 190 electron microscopic images. Our technological needs are met through a robust and reliable videoconference system that allows for live, simultaneous communication of audio/visual materials across the three sites. This system also ensures student access to faculty content expertise during all didactic teaching sessions. Student examination results and surveys demonstrate that the distribution of our Histology curriculum has been successful. Anat Sci Ed 1:95–101, 2008. © 2008 American Association of Anatomists.

AB  - Medical Education 2010:44: 256–262 Context In August 2004, the Northern Medical Program (NMP), a distributed campus of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia, Canada, admitted its first students. Situated at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, the NMP created new opportunities, challenges, stresses and changes for the approximately 180 local specialists and family doctors. This study examines the initial impacts of the NMP on doctors practising in its host community. Methods Qualitative interview methods were used. A purposive sample was drawn from: (i) doctors who had involvement with the NMP, and (ii) doctors who were not involved with the NMP. Data were collected from May to September 2007 using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and checked by participants. Analysis involved identifying, coding and categorising key emergent themes until saturation. Results Prior to the implementation of the NMP, doctors in Prince George had formed cohesive networks, in the face of adverse conditions, that functioned effectively as a form of social capital. The introduction of new doctors and resources through the NMP disrupted this sense of community cohesiveness. Over time, however, the NMP has created new mechanisms by which doctors interact and develop partnerships. Discussion The study confirms the value of a social capital framework for understanding a medical community’s adaptation to change. At this early point, it appears the NMP has created new mechanisms by which doctors can interact and develop the partnerships and relationships necessary to renew a sense of community cohesion.

AB  - In early 2019, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) intervened at the Gidimt'en Access Checkpoint in northern British Columbia (BC) and arrested 14 land defenders, garnering global media attention. To explore the ways that settler common sense (Rifkin 2013) is assembled and perpetuated in Canada, this paper examines how Wet'suwet'en mobilization is framed in news media coverage. Situating our work in relation to settler colonial studies and informed by the writings of Indigenous scholars, we use critical discourse analysis to assess mainstream news media framings of the Wet'suwet'en struggle. Drawing from literature on social movement suppression, we discern three main themes in these texts that work to validate the RCMP's excessive use of force against land defenders and delegitimize the Wet'suwet'en's claim to sovereignty. While this framing set the stage for sustained corporate incursions, police surveillance, and occupation across unceded Wet'suwet'en territory, we suggest negative framing as well as activist use of social media to visualize state repression may have created the conditions for what Hess and Martin (2006) call backfire.

AB  - Research has attributed the ‘silent suffering’ of men with depression to the inﬂuences of dominant masculine ideals such as strength and stoicism. Similarly, rural ideals – romanticized notions about rural places – have been shown to mute mental health issues and create barriers to help-seeking. This article examines the experiences of men with depression in Prince George, a northern resourcebased community in British Columbia, Canada. Findings reveal how depressed men and their female partners enacted strategies to positively reinforce men’s gendered sense of self, in a context that otherwise may render them ‘out of place’. While favouring men’s wellbeing, these strategies can also perpetuate an invisible geography of men’s depression.

AB  - Abstract Reconstructed recruitment was compared with the relatively limited set of anthropogenic alterations to the Nechako watercourse to identify and investigate potential causes of recruitment failure of Nechako River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus. Back-calculation of historic recruitment shows that recruitment was present but variable from 1946 until 1964. Subsequent to 1964 there was a rapid decline, principally in 1967, and recruitment failure has continued since that time. Flow regulation, which began in 1952 with the completion of Kenney Dam, preceded recruitment failure by 15 years and therefore flow regulation does not supply a simple unicausal explanation for recruitment failure. We propose that sediment input from an upstream channel avulsion in 1961, in combination with elevated flows in 1964 and 1967, led to alterations to riverbed substrates in critical white sturgeon habitat. Using air photos and specific gauge analysis, we identified a “sediment wave” in the upper Nechako River. The timing and location of avulsion sediments indicates that recruitment failure is most likely due to alteration of main channel substrates rather than the loss of off-channel habitat. Findings are discussed with reference to general hypotheses for recruitment failure in other white sturgeon populations.

AB  - This study investigates the development and application of a simple method to calculate annual and seasonal PM2.5 and PM10 background concentrations in small cities and rural areas. The Low Pollution Sectors and Conditions (LPSC) method is based on existing measured long-term data sets and is designed for locations where particulate matter (PM) monitors are only influenced by local anthropogenic emission sources from particular wind sectors. The LPSC method combines the analysis of measured hourly meteorological data, PM concentrations, and geographical emission source distributions. PM background levels emerge from measured data for specific wind conditions, where air parcel trajectories measured at a monitoring station are assumed to have passed over geographic sectors with negligible local emissions. Seasonal and annual background levels were estimated for two monitoring stations in Prince George, Canada, and the method was also applied to four other small cities (Burns Lake, Houston, Quesnel, Smithers) in northern British Columbia. The analysis showed reasonable background concentrations for both monitoring stations in Prince George, whereas annual PM10 background concentrations at two of the other locations and PM2.5 background concentrations at one other location were implausibly high. For those locations where the LPSC method was successful, annual background levels ranged between 1.8 ± 0.1 µg/m3 and 2.5 ± 0.1 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and between 6.3 ± 0.3 µg/m3 and 8.5 ± 0.3 µg/m3 for PM10. Precipitation effects and patterns of seasonal variability in the estimated background concentrations were detectable for all locations where the method was successful. Overall the method was dependent on the configuration of local geography and sources with respect to the monitoring location, and may fail at some locations and under some conditions. Where applicable, the LPSC method can provide a fast and cost-efficient way to estimate background PM concentrations for small cities in sparsely populated regions like northern British Columbia.

AB  - Profundal lake sediments are effective sample media for geochemical surveys in the northern Interior Plateau of central British Columbia, where epithermal gold prospects are an important exploration target. The problems posed by sampling of surficial materials for Au analysis are well known, but no field investigations have been made into the most appropriate size of lake sediment samples to collect in this part of the Cordillera. Samples collected with the Hornbrook-type sampler typically weigh 50 to 100 g when dry, and doubling the size of the field samples might be expected to yield more representative and reliable Au concentrations. To test this hypothesis, a comparative study of two field sample sizes was conducted in Clisbako Lake, adjacent to the Clisbako epithermal gold prospect, to ascertain whether or not there are significant differences in Au concentrations with increasing sample size. Clisbako Lake is located about 100 km west of Quesnel in the Fraser Plateau, an area of low to moderate relief and extensive drift cover. Gold occurs in quartz stockwork and silicified breccia zones within a low-sulphidation adularia-sericite epithermal system hosted in Eocene continental volcanics. Two corresponding lake sediment samples were collected at each of 36 sites: a standard sample obtained from a single drop of the sampler, and a second, larger sample obtained by combining sediment from two drops of the sampler. Sediments were dried, disaggregated and pulverized in a ceramic ring mill prior to analysis for Au and additional elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Gold concentrations in the centre of the profundal basin (4–8 ppb) are considerably greater than the regional median of 1 ppb in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Elevated concentrations of Au, As (median: 25.5 ppm) and Sb (median: 3.1 ppm) in lake sediments reflect the geochemistry of adjacent zones of epithermal mineralization and alteration. Median concentrations of 9 ppb Au over the entire lake were obtained for both standard and large-size sample suites, and gold distribution patterns are similar for both sample sizes. Equivalency of population means were tested with a two-sample paired duplicate t-test and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) on 34 sample pairs. Results indicate that there is no significant difference between Au concentrations of the standard and large-size lake sediment samples. There is no evidence to suggest that use of larger, more costly, lake sediment samples are more effective or reliable indicators of epithermal Au mineralization in this region than standard-size samples. The standard samples are satisfactory media for regional and property-scale lake sediment geochemical surveys.

AB  - We have analyzed the methylmercury exposures of native women consuming fish from a reservoir and two lakes in British Columbia. Probability density functions representing methylmercury dose were generated using reasonable distributions for exposure parameters. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of alternative parameter values on the exposure estimates. The effect of ignoring variability and uncertainty in exposure was also assessed. Calculated mean daily doses of methylmercury for the target populations were compared to the estimated average dose for the general population. We also determined the percentages of the native women populations with exposures exceeding current guidance values as well as published thresholds for neurological effects. The analysis demonstrates the importance of better characterizing the low dose effects of methylmercury, as the predicted doses fall in the range of recommended maximum daily doses but well below the higher estimates of the effect threshold.

No evidence of Brucella infection was found in the moose tested and it was concluded that they were probably not of great significance in the epidemiology of bovine brucellosis in the study area and were therefore unlikely to have hindered attempts to eradicate brucellosis from the cattle in that area.

AB  - Geographic access to emergency treatment remains an important public policy concern as rural emergency medical systems respond to various pressures to centralize services. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are effective tools to determine what proportion of a given population is adequately served by existing or proposed service distributions. METHODS: This study compares 2 GIS approaches to determining whether recent standards of emergency care access established by the British Columbia Ministry of Health Services are being met in Northern British Columbia. In particular, we compare results obtained using the more commonly used straight-line, or "as the crow flies," method with those obtained using a more sophisticated method that estimates travel time using digitally referenced road network data. RESULTS: Both methods reveal that provincial standards of emergency access are not being met in Northern British Columbia. CONCLUSION: In terms of comparing the 2 approaches, the network technique indicated a lower level of access and was more accurate in identifying populations residing inside and outside the "golden hour" of emergency care.

AB  - The damming of the Nechako River created a huge reservoir to provide hydro power to Alcan's aluminum smelter in Kitimat. Alcan hurriedly flooded the 65 000 ha valley without harvesting any of the 17 million cubic metres of the valley's timber. International Marine Logging recently bid on three tenures to harvest the submerged forest. During the late 1970s and through the 1980s IML salvaged logs from Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island. Since 1990 IML has invested in product testing, feasibility studies and securing financing to seek the Nechako reservoir timber salvaging rights and is now waiting for the government to make timber licence awards. Until recently, the logs and tree stems pulled from the bottom of lakes, reservoirs and waterways were assumed good only for pulp. The Nechako reservoir timber does not have enough fibre strength for the Council of Forest Industries to approve it for use as stress-grade lumber. But Nichols and IML have found a way to circumvent the problem. They extracted a sample of logs from the bottom of Nechako reservoir and shipped them to Oregon for testing. With the help of modern equipment it was discovered that the salvaged timber could be manufactured into veneers that can be used for producing plywood. Forest Renewal B.C. allocated funds to help develop the equipment for the underwater logging operations. Last year the Crown corporation, with an annual budget of $400 million, allocated $350,000 for underwater logging research and development. Bluewater Marine Services Ltd has designed an unmanned submersible which can be operated hydraulically from a barge like an underwater feller-buncher. It fastens itself to the tree while it cuts it down. Developed in Victoria and manufactured in Vancouver the submersible device is expected to be sent to Kinbasket Lake for testing later this month. The Kinbasket reservoir was flooded in 1973. It contains primarily hemlock, cedar, and fir which was flooded by the building of the Mica Dam.

AB  - Damming of large rivers in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Canada has divided the historical population of white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus into more than 36 fragmented populations, few of which are thriving. We now face the challenge of managing these populations to avoid extirpation. Two goals of this study were to identify extinction thresholds related to small size and inadequate habitat for this species. The minimum viable population size (MVP) is the threshold size above which populations support recruitment and grow and below which populations fail to support recruitment and decline. We estimated a single, cross-population MVP using data from multiple populations and quantile regression, which removed the effects of factors other than population size. Only two populations (those in the Bonneville and Dalles reservoirs on the Columbia River), both with significant increasing trends, were larger than our MVP estimate. We detected significant decreasing trends in two populations—those below Bonneville Dam and in the Kootenai River. To discover how site-specific differences in river habitat influence MVP, we used a population viability analysis (PVA) model that incorporated Allee mechanisms. The PVA model identified a river segment length below which extinction was certain regardless of initial population size. Above this threshold, simulated populations in river segments that were longer or that provided more frequent recruitment opportunities were able to persist with smaller initial sizes. Two priorities emerged for white sturgeon: monitoring age structure and understanding the circumstances preventing recruitment to age 1. Our results ultimately guided us toward thresholds in rearing habitat and age structure that promise to develop into more useful conservation tools than MVP for this and similar long-lived species.

AB  - ABSTRACT It is at the local/community level that the connections among ecosystem health, the health of human communities, and individual livelihoods are most apparent and critical. This paper reports a number of community initiatives aimed at improving or providing alternative livelihoods, while at the same time conserving or restoring the integrity of the ecosystem on which the community depends. It presents case studies of Zimbabwe’s CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) and Akwesasne in northeastern North America, as well as examples from northern Canada, of communities that have attempted to integrate economic development, community values/culture, and the restoration of ecosystem and community health. In both the north and the south these communities face ecological pressures such as climate change, industrial pollution, loss of diversity and productivity, deforestation, and resulting loss of traditional livelihood strategies. They are also victims of global economic forces, economic and institutional globalization, and are struggling to make adaptive responses. Common themes are identified across the case studies and we identify the need for indicators and programs that recognize and reinforce the interconnections and guide development programs that integrate community and ecosystem health and sustainability.

It is shameful that in such a rich country, such disparities persist. Spend a week on a reserve. It will change the way you think.” According to Pawlovich, if there’s any hope for changing a medical system that evidence increasingly documents is neither meeting the needs of indigenous peoples nor substantially lessening the health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, physicians have to radically rethink how and where medicine is delivered.....

AB  - The college of New Caledonia (CNC) in Prince George, British Columbia, believes in creating an environment where students can learn leadership skills from the beginning of their professional education. To that end, students, faculty members and administrators of CNC's health sciences and social services division worked together to engage in a campaign called "Expect a Leader." The intention of this campaign was to strengthen interdisciplinary awareness between programs and to introduce leadership qualities to future healthcare professionals. This article demonstrates how this initiative created change within six health science programs and across an entire division. The authors represent a cross-disciplinary team of health professionals: former CNC students, faculty members and the administrator. This team came together to discuss leadership strategies and activities that occurred within the educational setting and in the community during the Expect a Leader campaign. The authors anticipate that the campaign will foster students' involvement in interdisciplinary leadership activities within practice settings. Readers of this article will learn about the positive effects of promoting interdisciplinary leadership campaigns across healthcare disciplines, and will gain an understanding of reasons for nurturing leadership from the beginning of the students' education.

This analysis of documents produced and shared by organizers of Freedom Train 2012 maps modes of mobilizing participation across media spaces. Drawing upon alternative media literature, this article proposes a turn from analyzing how protest movements use media tools to how protest movements can be understood as forms of alternative media. The article concludes by advocating further study of alternative media practices to attend to how traditionally marginalized voices and cross-community communication networks contest industrial, governmental, and mainstream media power.

AB  - In the northern interior of BC, the town of Smithers' new garbage collection bylaw will make it illegal as of January 1, 2001, to put any product stewardship items, such as used beverage containers and old paint, into the local landfill. The bylaw also bans old corrugated cardboard, grass clippings, leaves and clean wood waste. The bylaw includes a new and visionary definition of garbage as "any material that has no economic value to a local enterprise." Farrow adds, though, that this strategy would be much more effective if the regional government would impose tipping fees at the landfill. Unlike many regional governments for rural Canadian communities, the regional district of Bulkley-Nechako doesn't charge fees to dump at its landfill. "Without the tipping fees we have no financial incentive to reduce waste, even though we recognize our social and environmental responsibility to do so. We could easily reduce our annual expenditure on waste disposal costs by one quarter if there were tipping fees ... and that would free up money for recycling and education initiatives." Our "take, make and waste" economy will pose challenges for R-CED. The prevailing wisdom remains to throw things "away" and many manufacturers are happy with the status quo, which dumps the responsibility for waste management on taxpayers.

AB  - This study quantifies the contribution of atmospheric rivers (ARs) to annual and extreme river runoff and evaluates the relationships between watershed characteristics and AR-related maximum river runoff across British Columbia and southeastern Alaska (BCSAK). Datasets used include gauged runoff from 168 unregulated watersheds, topographic characteristics of those watersheds, a regional AR catalog, and integrated vapor transport fields for water years (WYs) 1979–2016. ARs contribute ~22% of annual river runoff along the Coast and Insular Mountains watersheds, which decreases inland to ~11% in the watersheds of the Interior Mountains and Plateau. Average association between ARs and annual maximum river runoff attains >80%, >50%, and <50% along the watersheds of the western flanks of the Coast Mountains, the Interior Mountains, and Interior Plateau, respectively. There is no significant change in AR-related extreme annual maximum runoff across BCSAK during 1979–2016. AR conditions occur during 25 out of 32 of the flood-related natural disasters in British Columbia during WYs 1979–2016. AR-related annual maximum runoff magnitude is significantly higher than non-AR-related annual maximum runoff for 30% of the watersheds studied. Smaller and steeper watersheds closer to the coast are more susceptible to AR-related annual maximum runoff than their inland counterparts. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity as a major control for the distribution of peak runoff in BCSAK. This work provides insights on the hydrological response of watersheds of northwestern North America to landfalling ARs that may improve flood risk assessment and disaster management in this region.

AB  - Chlorophyll a (Chl a) seasonality was investigated in four shallow eutrophic lakes located in north-central British Columbia (western Canada). Chlorophyll a concentration maxima in all four lakes occurred during the late summer/early autumn when near-surface total phosphorus ([Tot-P]) and total dissolved P concentrations, pH, and water temperature were highest. Mass balance and inferential analyses showed that bloom-triggering P loads came mostly from within-lake sources, but that mechanisms controlling internal loading in Charlie and Tabor (lakes having hypolimnetic oxygen deficits during summer) were fundamentally different than those in Nulki and Tachick (isothermal, well oxygenated lakes). Although the timing and intensity of major blooms were associated with late summer/early autumn P loads, average summer [Chl a] were predicted well by previously developed models based solely on spring overturn [Tot-P]. Instantaneous within-lake [Chl a] were best predicted by models incorporating both surface [Tot-P] and temperature (r2 = 0.57–0.70). Moreover, [Tot-P] and temperature combined accounted for 57% of among-lake variations in instantaneous [Chl a]: log [Chl a] = 0.038 (°C) + 0.006 ([Tot-P]) + 0.203 (P < 0.001), where [Chl a] and [Tot-P] are in μg l−1. Positive associations between instantaneous [Chl a] and temperature support climate change models that forecast changes in phytoplankton productivity even if nutrient loading rates remain constant.

AB  - In central British Columbia, ice flow during the late Wisconsinan Fraser glaciation (ca. 25–10 ka) occurred in three phases. The ice expansion phase occurred during an extended period when glaciers flowed westward to the Pacific Ocean and east-southeastward onto the Nechako Plateau from ice centers in the Skeena, Hazelton, Coast, and Omineca Mountains. Initially, glacier flow was confined by topography along major valleys, but eventually piedmont and montane glaciers coalesced to form an integrated glacier system, the Cordilleran ice sheet. In the maximum phase, a Cordilleran ice divide developed over the Nechako Plateau to 300 km inland from the Pacific coast. At this time, the surface of the ice sheet extended well above 2500 m above sea level, and flowed westward over the Skeena, Hazelton, and Coast Mountains onto the continental shelf, and eastward across the Rocky Mountains into Alberta. In the late glacial phase, a rapid rise of the equilibrium line caused ice lobes to stagnate in valleys, and restricted accumulation centers to high mountains.Discordant directions in ice flow are attributed to fluctuations of the ice divide representing changes in the location of accumulation centers and ice thickness. Ice centers probably shifted in response to climate, irregular growth in the ice sheet, rapid calving, ice streaming, and drainage of proglacial and subglacial water bodies. Crosscutting ice-flow indicators and preservation of early (valley parallel) flow features in areas exposed to later (cross-valley) glacier erosion indicate that the ice expansion phase was the most erosive and protracted event.

AB  - Background: Policing has profound health implications for people who use illicit drugs. Among Aboriginal communities, distrust of police is common, due partly to legacies of colonial policing. In response to the paucity of research among Aboriginal people who use drugs, this paper aims to: (1) Describe the policing experiences of young Aboriginal people who use drugs; (2) Identify policing activities associated with unsafe injection practices; and (3) Elucidate barriers to positive police relations.Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. This mixed-methods study (N = 372) used period prevalence from 2007 to 2010 to describe policing experiences, mixed effects regression models to identify correlates of policing activities, and thematic qualitative analysis to assess attitudes to police relations.Results: Many participants were stopped by police (73%), experienced physical force by police (28%), had drug equipment conﬁscated (31%), and changed location of drug use because of police (43%). Participants who reported dealing drugs (40%) were signiﬁcantly more likely to experience police engagement. Among participants in Prince George, 4% reported to have had non-consensual sex with members of the criminal justice system. Policing activity was signiﬁcantly associated with syringe sharing, rushed injection, and reused syringe. Due to personal experience, practical concerns, and intergenerational legacies of unfair policing practices, most participants did not want a positive relationship with police (57%). Desire for a positive relationship with police was directly associated with being helped by police, and inversely associated with being stopped by police and experiencing physical force by police.Conclusion: Policing activities may be impacting the well-being of Aboriginal people who use drugs. Due to focused prosecution of street-level drug dealing, some police may favor enforcement over harm reduction. Positive police engagement and less aggressive policing may enhance perceptions of police among young Aboriginal people who use drugs.

AB  - Erosion along the Nechako Reservoir and Cheslatta River Spillway has resulted in unusually well-exposed late Quaternary and Holocene stratigraphy. Surficial sediments in the study area are mostly products of Late Wisconsinan glaciation. However, evidence for pre-Late Wisconsinan sedimentation has been found along the shores of the Nechako Reservoir, including till of an older glaciation and organic-bearing, blue-grey, lacustrine sediments of probable Middle Wisconsinan age. Stratigraphic correlation of the lake sediments suggests that an extensive lake system occurred in the region during the Olympia Nonglacial Interval. Late Wisconsinan ice initially moved along major valleys, with glaciofluvial outwash deposited in front of the advancing ice. Advance-phase glaciolacustrine sediments are rare but significant, as slope failures are spatially associated with areas where they are preserved. The distribution of these sediments and associated deltaic deposits indicates that advance-phase glacial lakes occurre..., De l'érosion le long du réservoir Nechako et du déversoir de la rivière Cheslatta a produit de très beaux affleurements de la stratigraphie du Quaternaire tardif et de l'Holocène. Les sédiments de surface dans la région à l'étude sont surtout des produits de la glaciation du Wisconsinien tardif. Toutefois, des preuves de sédimentation au pré-Wisconsinien tardif ont été retrouvées le long des berges du réservoir Nechako; elles comprennent un till d'une glaciation plus ancienne et des sédiments lacustres gris-bleu contenant de la matière organique, datant probablement du Wisconsinien moyen. La corrélation stratigraphique des sédiments lacustres suggère qu'un système extensif de lacs était en place dans la région durant l'intervalle non glaciaire Olympia. La glace du Wisconsinien tardif a tout d'abord avancé le long des vallées majeures alors que du matériel stratifié fluvio-glaciaire était déposé en avant de la glace qui avançait.

VL  - 54
AB  - Approximately 50% of the Nechako River's flow was permanently diverted into another watershed in the early 1950s. Up to 50% of the remaining flow may be diverted in the future. To give insight as to how future and past flow reductions will/have affect(ed) macrophyte abundance, we first developed equations relating average summer channel speed to cross-sectional biomass and bottom cover from data collected at 26 sites. The average summer channel speed at each site was then estimated assuming flows (at Fort Fraser) of 408 m(3).s(-1) (natural), 165 m(3).s(-1) (1952-1990 average), and two future scenarios: 120 and 60 m(3).s(-1). We then used these estimates in our equations to compute abundance under the various flow regimes. Our models suggest that flow has Little influence on macrophyte abundance in two fast-flowing reaches, which together account for 50% of the river's length. In contrast, the diversion was predicted to have increased biomass and cover by, on average, 66 g.m(-2) and 15%, respectively, in a slow-flowing reach accounting for 20% of the river's length. Biomass and cover in this reach could increase by an additional 65 g.m(-2) (or 240 g.m(-2)) and 9% (or 29%) if flows are reduced to 120 m(3).s(-1) (or 60 m(3).s(-1)).

AB  - Background: COVID-19 was declared a global emergency in the first quarter of 2020. It is has resulted in and continues in over a million deaths worldwide and halted medical systems and particularly elective surgeries worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the initial COVID-19 pandemic months on orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia. Methods: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. Results: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of > 15% (range 0–100%). Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancellation of surgeries has created an increased backlog of 32,400 orthopaedic surgeries in British Columbia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the implementation of telemedicine, which will be a long-lasting benefit in providing healthcare. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Quaternary stratigraphy of the Babine Lake region is characterized by a Late Wisconsinan succession of advance-phase glaciolacustrine sediments, glaciofluvial deposits, and till. Pollen data from a rare new interglacial site suggest a colder than present Middle Wisconsinan climate. Ice flow during the last glaciation was dominantly southeasterly, but in the Babine Range a regional, westerly ice-flow event occurred. Evidence for westerly flow diminishes eastward of Babine Lake, suggesting that the valley was near the eastward limit of an interior ice divide. Deglacial sediments include ice-marginal debris-flow, glaciofluvial, and glaciolacustrine sediments. Raised-delta elevations indicate that Glacial Lake Babine extended nearly 150 m above present lake level to 850 m asl, and higher, earlier phases may have existed locally. A variety of Holocene deposits cap the Quaternary succession. Glaciation has important implications for exploration in this copper-producing area. Southeasterly glacial dispersal ...,

AB  - The Wet'suwet'en are currently struggling to affirm their Aboriginal and territorial rights through the British Columbia treaty process. While this process continues, resource extraction activities remove large volumes of culturally important resources. At present, very few areas of the their territory have not been impacted by logging or mining development. Understandably, the Wet'suwet'en feel a sense of urgency regarding the conservation and protection of their natural and cultural resources. This paper examines how the Wet'suwet'en adapted the existing archaeological process within the resource management industry to better reflect their vision and cultural values. The creation of non-legislated policy and protocol agreements with various industry and government entities, combined with the Wet'suwet'en Territorial Stewardship Plan (WTSP), has allowed this First Nation to centrally position themselves in the archaeological process, which did not adequately address their needs. The primary result has been greater Wet'suwet'en involvement in decisions made regarding the management of their cultural resources.

We identify some of the reasons for this discrepancy and provide suggestions for future practice.

AB  - Guided by feminist and community-based participatory methodologies and by efforts to decolonize health research practices, and undertaken with qualitative research methods (interviews, open-ended questionnaires, and analysis of arts-based expressions like storytelling, joumaling, and picture-making), this research identified challenges and barriers that (predominantly Aboriginal) women in northern British Columbia faced when trying to access sexual health care services related to HPV and cervical cancer screening. The research also examined the possible effectiveness of creative or arts-based strategies to promote cervical health and screening awareness among young and/or traditionally underserved or marginalized women. We review findings from data gathered over six months during multiple interactions with 22 women from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Results confirm that ethnicity, finances, and formal education are determinants in women's awareness about, access to, and use of cervical screening services, and that experiences of gendered victimization, feelings of disempowerment, and life circumstances all influenced women's comfort levels with, access to, and use of cervical cancer screening services.

AB  - The Yinka Dene Alliance is a coalition of six First Nations in British Columbia. This Alliance has engaged a form of resistance to the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline articulated in such manifestos as the Save the Fraser Declaration. This Declaration (endorsed by over 130 First Nations in western Canada) brings to the fore the authority of the nations of the Yinka Dene Alliance, authority possessed as Indigenous nations and expressed in the form of pronouncements about what they consider to be against their Indigenous laws. The middle sections of this paper contain an exploration into how the Indigenous authority grounding these expressions of Indigenous law would likely be treated by Canadian law. The intent is to show just how antagonistic the Canadian legal apparatus is to such forms of resistance. Illustration of the depth and nature of the hostility leads into questions about why this might be so. Reflections on what seems to fuel an absolute denial of Indigenous authority show not only how challenging it will be to make headway but also the great promise held out by resistance founded on such authority. This promise is not only for Aboriginal peoples in Canada (as they struggle to protect their lands and cultures), but for citizens of the world in search of grounds of authority that might stand up in the face of powerful forces seemingly intent on short-term wealth maximization based on unsustainable resource exploitation.

AB  - While environmental rights have largely been situated within the public law arena of statutes and constitutions, tort law is an important complementary tool for protecting environmental entitlements. Aboriginal peoples face systemic barriers to accessing the environmental protection provided by tort law, in particular the law of nuisance. This Article argues for an application of tort law that is sensitive to the formal and substantive equality rights of Aboriginal peoples in the area of environmental protection. Through an examination of Thomas v. Rio Tinto as a case study in Aboriginal environmental rights in tort, the authors demonstrate that tort law can and should be responsive to the unique property interests and legal perspectives of Aboriginal peoples.

AB  - David Douglas was the first tospecialize in the botany of the North-west, and systematicallycomb the territory for specimens. Making his headquarters at Fort Vancouver, in the State of Washington, he travelled up and down the Columbia by canoe or on foot, sometimes with an Indian guide, sometimes with the Hudson’s Bay Company’s men, but often alone with his dog.Difficult and exhausting as were his journeys, he was happy in the rich harvest of plants which he obtained. His expectations were fully realized. During the six months following his arrival in the country he collected about 500 different specimens (499 to be exact), obtaining as far as possible from 12 to 24 samples of each specimen.Little escaped the keen observation of the young student of natural history. His attention was not confined to vegetation; specimens of birds, insects, and animals were also obtained.After two years’ painstaking labour in the Columbia River region from 1825 to 1827, and a very hard journey south towards California to find the sugar pine he returned to England.After a two years’ sojourn in England, during which he was feted and lionized for his botanical discoveries, he came back to Western America in 1830. This time he came trained and equipped for doing work quite different from that formerly undertaken, having added thetaking of geographical and astronomical observations to hisformer pursuits.Leaving Fort Vancouver March 20, 1833, he travelled with the express as faras Fort Okanagan. Douglas also undertook the making of field-sketches along the route and did a continuous series of the country travelledfrom Fort Okanagan to the Quesnel River, showing the naturalconfiguration, with notes on trees, vegetation, and soil. Leaving Fort Kamloops the brigade went on to Fort Alexandria, where the horses were changed for boats. The journey was also up-stream on the Nechako and Stuart rivers. Douglas went up the Nechako to Fort Fraser, on Fraser Lake, and probably went overlandfrom there to Fort St. James.After a very brief stay at Fort St. James, during which he took some observations, he and Johnson embarked in a small birch-bark canoe and descended the Stuart and Nechako rivers. At Fort George they stayeda day or two with George Linton, clerk in charge there, and then began descending the Fraser. And now disaster was added to disappointment. On June 13, at the “Stony Islands,” as he called them, they were wreckedin the rapids; the canoe was smashed to pieces. Douglas was carried down the rapids and into the whirlpool below, and he was swept about in theturbulent waters for an hour and forty minutes, before being washed on to the rocky shore. He lost everything he had except his instruments, his astronomical journal, notes and charts, and his barometrical observations.The last months of Douglas’s life were spent in the Sandwich Islands. He arrived in Honolulu in December, 1833, and spent the next few months in exploring the island of Hawaii. Hecollected a large number of ferns. The two great volcanic peaks attracted him and he climbed both, being the first white man to do so. As usual, he endured terrible hardships. In August, 1834, while crossing the island alone with his dog he fell into a pit used for trapping wild cattle, and was gored to death. Some say he was pushed in, and in this way murderedfor his money. Whichever it was, it was a horrible death, andan untimely one, for he was only 34 years old.As the pioneer botanist of North-west America and California, Douglas made their flora known to the world. The number of plants which he introduced to England in the form of root, seed,or cutting is remarkable. Other collectors have contributed moreto botanical knowledge or made more extensive collections, but none has contributed more to our stock of beautiful and hardy plants than he.

AB  - This study of family practitioners as anesthetists is based on data extracted from records of the Medical Services Plan of British Columbia. During the period from 1976 to 1986, the proportion of anesthetics that were administered by non-certified anesthetists declined from 28.3% to 22.1% of the total number. Small and medium-sized hospitals continue to depend on family-physician anesthetists. Family practitioners make up 96.9% of all anesthetists practising in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds and 88.2% of anesthetists in hospitals with 50-99 beds. Rural areas are served almost exclusively by family-practice anesthetists, since 16 of 29 B.C. regional districts have one or no certified anesthetists. The author discusses the implications of this situation for the future of family-practice anesthesia.

AB  - One of the board's key deliverables in its five-year mandate was a strategic plan for sustainability of the Fraser Basin. This plan, named the Charter for Sustainability of the Fraser Basin, was published on 27 February 1997 (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). The Charter is a prescription developed by, and for, the people who live, work, and play in the Fraser Basin. The Charter was developed based on the work of government and nongovernment agencies, committees, and individuals working together throughout the Fraser Basin. Here are some of the key elements of the Charter.The operational arm of the Fraser Basin Council Society is its Council. The Council is the custodian of the basin Charter for Sustainability (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). The Council is unique. Normally, organizations are constructed on adversarial lines. However, the Fraser Basin Council is not, and represents a new approach to doing business which cuts across adversarial lines and other differences in an effort to promote the common social good. It is a nongovernmental organization informed by governments. Governments are part of the council's management structure but it is "arm's length" from governments. It is a not-for-profit, fee-for-service, entity that can, for the first time, legally meld public sector funding with private sector participation. Although the Council is presently funded through equal contributions from the federal, provincial, and local governments, it is empowered to raise funds in many forms: bequests, legacies, property, or other in-kind gifts to augment Council operations.The Fraser Basin Charter for Sustainability is one of the final documents developed by the Fraser Basin Management Board (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). It is a broadly worded document which lays out a vision, principles, goals, and broad strategies for achieving sustainability of the Fraser Basin. Individuals, businesses, community and environmental groups, and governments are invited to promote the Charter and work together to support its implementation. The Fraser Basin Council will be responsible for updating the Charter and encouraging the application of its values and principles.

AB  - The Nechako River originally drained a network of spectacular wilderness streams and lakes. Few knew this area, other than the Cheslatta T'en First Nations community and some tourists, farmers and ranchers. Alcan arrived in 1950, lured by the promise of cheap electricity (required in vast quantities for aluminum smelting) and provincial subsidies. In return for Alcan's investment in a dam, power plant and smelter, the Industrial Development Act of 1949 provided tax exemptions, considerable autonomy, and control over much of the forests and waters of the region.In 1979 Alcan announced plans to expand electrical production at Kemano. A 1987 agreement, negotiated secretly with the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, gave it permission to divert more of the Nechako, reducing its flow to about 12 percent of the pre - 1950 amount. The agreement also contained conditions intended to ensure protection of salmon stocks. But even as Alcan began construction in 1988, opposition was increasing among residents of the Nechako Valley, led by the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and the Rivers Defense Coalition. Eventually, this opposition spread throughout the province, and captured considerable media attention. The controversy culminated in a public review by the BC Utilities Commission, and subsequently, [Mike Harcourt]'s announcement in January 1995.

AB  - The recent global commodities price boom prompted a significant growth inmineral exploration projects in British Columbia (BC). These now face theimpacts of the recession in the global economy. The forests in BC where many of these projects are underway is also facing a massive, climate-change related, pine beetle infestation which along with the housing slowdown in North America is causing a collapse of the region’s forestry industry. Mining development could create new jobs through economic development, reducing the exodus of skilledworkers and nurturing the already fragile state of many rural communities,including First Nations. Recent issues over new BC mining projects and theirimpacts on surrounding communities prompt consideration of an approach toproject planning that goes beyond simply aiming to mitigate environmental and social impacts. The opportunity exists to involve the participation of communities early in the planning process and to place greater consideration on the contribution of a project to building social capital in these mining communities. There is also the possibility to consider the role of a particular project in a more strategic sense, as part of regional development planning that deals with wider issues, time spans and synergies relating to socio-economic development in mining communities. This article stems from early research into the characterisa-tion of social capital and the use of community-indicators to forecast specificsocial and economic outcomes for new mining projects. The overall objective is to evaluate an approach to mine planning that potentially takes greater account of opportunities to enhance community health and resilience. Reference is made to a current mining project in north-central BC, characteristic of the complex socio-economic setting of contemporary mining developments in BC.

This paperexamines the historical origins of traditional CarrierSekani self-government and the events through whichtraditional self-government was undermined. It alsoexamines landscape changes that have occurred inCarrier Sekani territory since the arrival of non-aborigi-nal settlers, and the impacts of these changes on CarrierSekani communities. It is asserted that the roots of tradi-tional self-government have remained intact, though onan informal level. The basis for re-asserting control byCarrier Sekani nations over their lands and resources isa shared concern over traditional territories andresources. This is reflected in the priorities of CarrierSekani communities in the treaty-making process.

AB  - Pine cambium is a food resource that was regularly utilized by foraging populations of the interior of British Columbia from at least ad1790 to 1950. The scars left on living pine trees (Culturally Modified Trees, or CMTs) by cambium stripping are directly datable evidence for this subsistence activity by utilizing forestry increment borers to extract cores. Further, pine cambium is generally regarded as a marginal, or supplementary resource, with changes in the frequency of cambium collection being related to natural cycles in the abundance of staple resources. This paper discusses the dating of these subsistence features, and in comparing two areas of the Nechako River drainage of British Columbia, suggests that pine cambium was more intensively utilized in areas lacking salmon, the staple of the greater region.

AB  - This study examines the 1911–2010 variability and trends in annual streamflow at 139 sites across the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The Fraser River is the largest Canadian waterway flowing to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the world’s greatest salmon rivers. Our analyses reveal high runoff rates and low interannual variability in alpine and coastal rivers, and low runoff rates and high interannual variability in most streams in BC’s interior. The interannual variability in streamflow is also low in rivers such as the Adams, Chilko, Quesnel and Stuart where the principal salmon runs of the Fraser River occur. A trend analysis shows a spatially coherent signal with increasing interannual variability in streamflow across the FRB in recent decades, most notably in spring and summer. The upward trend in the coefficient of variation in annual runoff coincides with a period of near-normal annual runoff for the Fraser River at Hope. The interannual variability in streamflow is greater in regulated rather than natural systems; however, it is unclear whether it is predominantly flow regulation that leads to these observed differences. Environmental changes such as rising air temperatures, more frequent polarity changes in large-scale climate teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and retreating glaciers may be contributing to the greater range in annual runoff fluctuations across the FRB. This has implications for ecological processes throughout the basin, for example affecting migrating and spawning salmon, a keystone species vital to First Nations communities as well as to commercial and recreational fisheries. To exemplify this linkage between variable flows and biological responses, the unusual FRB runoff anomalies observed in 2010 are discussed in the context of that year’s sockeye salmon run. As the climate continues to warm, greater variability in annual streamflow, and hence in hydrological extremes, may influence ecological processes and human usage throughout the FRB in the 21st century.

AB  - Neoechinorhynchus salmonis sp. n. differs from N. rutili in having a larger body, wider proboscis, smaller, oval eggs, in the asymmetrical outer, acanthor membrane, and the female terminal genitalia. The new species was included as N. rutili in the Van Cleave and Lynch, and Bangham and Adams collections. Neoechinorhynchus salmonis differs from both N. saginatus and N. cylindratus in the body proportions, smaller egg size, and nature of the acanthor membranes. The parasites were found in the following hosts: Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum) kokanee, Salmo gairdneri (Richardson) rainbow trout, Prosopium williamsoni (Girard) mountain whitefish, and Ptychocheilus oregonensis (Richardson) northern squawfish.

AB  - Hydroelectric development, forest exploitation, agricultural land use and related human population numbers have increased rapidly during the last 40 years, in the basin of the Nechako River, a major tributary system of the Fraser River. The Kemano project of the Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd. begun in 1950, was the largest industrial scheme in the area. A key feature of the first stage of it was a dam which diverted about 40% of flow of the south branch of the Nechako River, through a tunnel in the mountains, to the Pacific Ocean. In 1987 an agreement for the Kemano Completion Project (KCP), which would have diverted 87% of the flow, was signed. This final phase of the project would have put important fisheries resources of the upper Fraser River at high risk. Mitigation for fisheries protection were inadequate or untested in the system at the time. Potential cumulative impacts of water abstraction, elevated pollution levels, increased water temperature and natural sediment were not addressed. In January 1995 KCP was cancelled but there remain at present no adequate measures to protect the fish and the river ecosystem. These measures are to be negotiated in the future. Future management of the whole Kemano development must provide biologically realistic flow and temperature regimes in the Nechako River, and must deal with cumulative impacts of population and industrial growth. To achieve ‘sustainability’ of fisheries in the Nechako River and upper Fraser watershed the present approach to the Kemano development must be changed fundamentally. The future of the Kemano development must be set in the context of the whole future of the upper Fraser system. Continued growth and development, as has occurred in the upper Fraser and total basin, can not go on without inimical changes to ecosystem conditions and loss of fisheries resources.

AB  - Concerns about living conditions on First Nations1 reserves are attracting a great deal of attention from public health practitioners and researchers looking to design and implement measures to improve and promote health. Issues related to geographic isolation, low socioeconomic status, and threats to traditional practices are known to contribute to poor health outcomes, especially amongst Aboriginal youth. Research and educational programs are needed to address these challenges yet even the most state-of-the art initiatives are destined to fail if they are perceived to be disrespectful of, and insensitive to, local First Nations' culture and ways of knowing. Inspired by Smith's call for decolonized methodologies, we develop the concept of appropriate engagement as a framework for working with First Nations. A case study of research and a nutrition program conducted in Takla Landing, British Columbia are presented to offer an outline of appropriate engagement and how it can be used to better inform public health initiatives aimed at improving the dietary practices of First Nations populations.

AB  - The susceptibility of the Prince George airshed to incidence of high concentrations of particulate matter &lt;10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) has raised considerable concern because of potential health hazards. This study examined the utility of chemical and morphological characteristics of PM10 collected and archived by the BC Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks from three monitoring stations to determine the possible sources of PM10 during selected episodic and non-episodic events. Samples from three episodic events (24 h PM10 levels &gt;50 μg m−3) and three non-episodic events (24 h PM10 levels &lt;50 μg m−3) in 1995–1996 were examined using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive system. Results show that rounded, spherical and oval shaped particulate were diagnostic for combustion sources, while irregular-shaped particulate were dominant in all samples including road dust. The particulate size distributions indicated that combustion sources contributed more to &lt;2.5 μm fraction while geologic material is responsible for particulate with diameter between 3 and 4 μm. Principal component analysis of in situ chemical composition suggests that high concentrations of aluminum, silicon and magnesium are indicative of geologic material while carbon, sodium and sulphur are indicative of combustion and industrial sources. Our study suggests that in Prince George, episodic events were influenced by geologic material while the non-episodic events are impacted by industrial, combustion and to some extent by geologic materials. We also found that the combined use of particulate morphology and elemental composition has a good potential to distinguish between geologic material and industrial/combustion sources of PM10 in the Prince George airshed.

AB  - A large number of groups in British Columbia and Canada as a whole have expended considerable effort to define sustainable development goals and, to a lesser extent, select sustainable development indicators. Many hope that collection and monitoring of such indicators will provide important policy guidance to decision-makers and provide a means for tracking sustainable development. This project was designed with the following goals: (i) to select indicators that could be linked to an operational definition for sustainable development within the Fraser River Basin (British Columbia); (ii) to assess the accessibility, quality and relevance of the best available data for developing such indicators; (iii) to apply modeling techniques for discerning the linkages among indicators; and (iv) to provide recommendations for further indicator selection and modeling research. The major methodological conclusions reached were: (i) it is important to link sustainable development goals to movements of a small slate of individual indicators as single indicators can rarely be linked to any specific sustainable development goal; (ii) the poor quality, inaccessibility and irrelevance of existing data are pervasive constraints to reliable indicator modeling; (iii) modeling is most appropriate at aggregated spatial scales such as provinces or large watersheds, while modeling at smaller ecosystem-based spatial levels is feasible but unreliable; and (iv) linking the use of deterministic and qualitative modeling approaches is a useful means for projecting indicators and discerning important policy linkages, while conventional statistical modeling approaches are frequently inappropriate because of unreliable or non-commensurable data. This has profound implications for indicator selection and modeling. In contrast to much of the current indicator work, which relies on selecting a large number of detailed specific indicators, it would be more fruitful and less costly to focus attention on a small number of indicators within selected indicator classes (such as economic, social, environmental or human health indicators). The precise specification of the indicator within each of these classes is of less consequence. Indicator modeling work should focus on larger scale systems, as opposed to smaller ecosystem units. Such work is most suited to identifying qualitative policy trade-offs and implications, rather than to forecasting specific indicators. Data gathering efforts can be scaled down substantially and should be informed, but not unduly constrained, by available model frameworks. Greater focus is required on modeling frameworks that can use incomplete data sets or qualitative information, and linking existing quantitative model structures to external qualitative models.

AB  - Osprey(Pandion haliaetus) eggs were collected during 1995 and 1996 at seven sites along the Fraser and Columbia River systems of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, USA. Fifty-four eggs were placed into a laboratory incubator. Thirty-eight of the hatched chicks were sacrificed within 24 h. Hatching success did not differ among sites and therefore between treatment and reference areas. Residual yolk sacs of eggs collected downstream of the large bleached-kraft pulp mill at Castlegar contained greater mean concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, 2,930 ng/kg lipid) compared with reference sites such as the Nechako River, an upper tributary of the Fraser system (33.7 ng/kg). Total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in yolk sacs were also higher at Castlegar and in samples from the Columbia River downstream of Portland, Oregon, compared with those from the Nechako River. Concentrations of measured chemicals, including TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs), total PCBs, p, p′-dichlorodiphenylethylene (p, p′-DDE), and other organochlorines were not different in eggs that failed to hatch compared with calculated whole-egg values for hatched eggs. There were significant biochemical responses; a hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) cross-reactive protein was detected in all samples tested and correlated positively with ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD) activity and yolk sac concentrations of TEQs and total PCBs. Tissue concentrations of vitamin A compounds varied among sites and correlated positively with yolk sac concentrations of TEQs and PCBs. Morphological, histological, and other physiological parameters, including chick growth, edema, deformities, and hepatic and renal porphyrin concentrations, neither varied among sites nor showed concentration-related effects.

AB  - Changes made to municipal boundaries are an important part of the process of urban growth. Boundary adjustments usually involve responding to urban sprawl occurring outside the municipal limits and to development trends occurring within the city as boundaries are altered to 'make room' for urban development. There has been little research within the Canadian context on the frequency of boundary adjustments undertaken by Canadian municipalities through time and by province. Existing studies tend to focus on individual case studies, included as part of a broader urban history, or they focus on general policy implications. This paper examines the broad sweep of annexation frequencies, temporal and spatial patterns through the post-war years, 1941 to 1991, for the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Descriptive statistical tests, such as analysis of variance, are used to examine comparisons of key variables within each province. The paper presents and analyzes statistics on annexation to answer three questions: (i) How important is annexation? One approach to this question is to assess how much annexation has taken place. The answer to this question can be taken as a partial measure of urban growth through annexation. (ii) How has annexation activity been distributed through time? Is annexation of only historical importance or are there significant contemporary events? (iii) How has annexation activity varied by province? The findings reveal that annexation is a pervasive form of local government reorganization. The frequency of annexation is shown to be related to municipal class, growth rate and population size. Annexation is also found to be unevenly distributed over time and space.

AB  - Bacterial colonization and growth responses of hybrid spruce (Picea glauca × engelmannii) seedlings after inoculation with plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) were evaluated in controlled environment and field assays. Six antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains belonging to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas were used as inocula. For controlled environment assays, surface sterilized seeds were inoculated with log 6 Bacillus or log 8 Pseudomonas colony-forming units (cfu) under gnotobiotic conditions for assessment of rhizosphere and internal root and stem tissue colonization. In the field trial, one-year-old, container-grown hybrid spruce seedlings were inoculated with each of the Bacillus or Pseudomonas strains 1–2 days before planting at nine field sites in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. All six strains colonized the rhizosphere with log 5.6−7.6 cfu g−1 root tissue under controlled environmental conditions. Two strains, Bacillus Pw-2R and Pseudomonas Sm3-RN, were also recovered from internal root and stem tissues with population sizes ranging from log 3.9 to log 5.0 cfu g−1 plant tissue. In the field trial, PGPR survived the winter in the rhizosphere with populations of log 2 to log 5 cfu g−1 root tissue 17 months after inoculation. In addition, spruce growth was significantly enhanced by bacterial inoculation at certain sites. The most effective growth-promoting strains were the endophytes, Sm3-RN and Pw2-R, and the external root colonizing strain, Ss2-RN. These three strains increased seedling dry weight up to 57% above noninoculated controls at five of the nine outplanting sites. Pseudomonas strain Sw1 and the other two Bacillus strains produced mean spruce dry weight increases at four of the sites. Seedling growth inhibition due to bacterial inoculation was detected at some sites. Our results confirm the short-term, site specific effectiveness of PGPR for reforestation of conifer seedlings, and indicate that benefits of a single inoculation at planting can extend through the second year in the field. In addition, bacteria capable of colonizing the seedling interior may be more effective PGPR for spruce than those restricted to the rhizosphere and the root surface. However, site specific seedling growth promotion may necessitate matching PGPR strains to outplanting sites for effective growth promotion.

AB  - The main findings of the current study were that exposing adult sockeye salmon Onchorhynchus nerka to a warm temperature that they regularly encounter during their river migration induced a heat shock response at an mRNA level, and this response was exacerbated with forced swimming. Similar to the heat shock response, increased immune defence-related responses were also observed after warm temperature treatment and with a swimming challenge in two different populations (Chilko and Nechako), but with some important differences. Microarray analyses revealed that 347 genes were differentially expressed between the cold (12–13° C) and warm (18–19° C) treated fish, with stress response (GO:0006950) and response to fungus (GO:0009620) elevated with warm treatment, while expression for genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0006119) and electron transport chain (GO:0022900) elevated for cold-treated fish. Analysis of single genes with real-time quantitative PCR revealed that temperature had the most significant effect on mRNA expression levels, with swimming and population having secondary influences. Warm temperature treatment for the Chilko population induced expression of heat shock protein (hsp) 90α, hsp90β and hsp30 as well as interferon-inducible protein. The Nechako population, which is known to have a narrower thermal tolerance window than the Chilko population, showed even more pronounced stress responses to the warm treatment and there was significant interaction between population and temperature treatment for hsp90β expression. Moreover, significant interactions were noted between temperature treatment and swimming challenge for hsp90α and hsp30, and while swimming challenge alone increased expression of these hsps, the expression levels were significantly elevated in warm-treated fish swum to exhaustion. In conclusion, it seems that adult O. nerka currently encounter conditions that induce several cellular defence mechanisms during their once-in-the-lifetime migration. As river temperatures continue to increase, it remains to be seen whether or not these cellular defences provide sufficient protection for all O. nerka populations.

AB  - In July, the Cheslatta sought an injunction from the BC Supreme Court to halt work on an access road. The presiding judge, Justice Robert Hutchison, known as the "one-day judge", abruptly ended the hearing claiming that Cheslatta's lawyer, Karen Wristen, had "just run out of time." She was unable to finish her closing arguments. After months of delays, the BC Supreme Court will finally hear the legal arguments from both sides in mid February 1997.The Huckleberry Project Committee, composed of representatives from Environment Canada, the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, the BC Mines Branch, as well as the Cheslatta and Wet'suwet'en First Nations, reviewed the mine proposal. However, Cheslatta critics say the committee's deliberations were based on incomplete information concerning metal concentration, toxin leachate, water quality and other hydrological factors. When more information was provided, specifically about the chemical characterization of the ore and design of the mine, it was not properly referred back to the project committee for full reassessment. The committee also lacked adequate information regarding the habitat and migratory patterns of fish, birds and wildlife that will be affected by the mine.A major claim of the mining lobby has been that BC will gain substantial economic benefits from the Huckleberry project. In 1995, Alan Savage, president of New Canamin Resources Ltd., sent a letter to then employment and investment minister Glen Clark, stating that "with export sales value in excess of $100 million per year at today's metal prices, this project can provide a significant contribution not only to the people of the Bulkley Valley, but, indeed, the province as a whole." Mine opponents say the Huckleberry mine will only employ approximately 200 people while all the ore will be shipped to Japan for processing.

AB  - Large areas of bedrock in Canada, such as in the interior plateau of British Columbia, are covered by a thick glacial overburden. Lateral variations in overburden thickness can create spurious anomalies in gravity data. These anomalies can be of a size and amplitude similar to those associated with mineral bodies and can be mistaken for them. A methodology is introduced that corrects gravity data for changes in overburden thickness through the use of a bedrock topography map created by integrating information from a helicopter transient electromagnetic survey with geological survey data, well water data, and gravel pit locations. The approach is tested for a 68 km × 38 km area in the prospective Nechako interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. The methodology extends the traditional Bouguer corrections by taking into account the gravitational contribution of the overburden. Results show that the capability of an airborne survey to detect a change in overburden thickness depends primarily on survey line spacing and to a lesser extent on the level of random noise in the gravity data. The bedrock topography correction has the capability of removing the gravitational attraction of overburden for the purpose of revealing, through interpretation, geological structures in the gravity data that originate from the bedrock and are otherwise concealed.

AB  - Wildlife incidents with aircraft cost airports and operators worldwide an average of US$1.28bn annually. In Canada, Airport Wildlife Management Plans (AWMPs) are designed to provide an outline of specific wildlife hazards at airports and recommend countermeasures to minimisestrike risk. Wildlife incident reports are a key component in the development of such plans. Here, wildlife incident reports were compiled and compared to data collected using newly-installed digital wildlife camera trap technology at the Prince George International Airport. Seven camera trapswere monitored for a total of 2,426 sampling days (9,228 camera days) between 2009 and 2016 and recorded a total of 3,046 animals within 16 different animal species/groups. Airport personnel recorded 4,640 animals and 23 different species/ groups during the same period. Camera traps recordedalmost five times as many animals (n = 2,525) on days when no wildlife incident reports were filed than days when wildlife incident reports were filed (n = 521) and camera traps recorded no images. Z-test for proportions analyses indicated that birds (ie flocks) were more commonly observedand reported by airport personnel than were captured by camera traps, while mammals such as moose (Alces alces), black bears (Ursus americanus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were more commonly recorded by camera traps. These findings suggest that data from camera traps can help inthe development of more informed AWMPs.

AB  - Wildlife strikes are a significant issue in the aviation industry, especially strikes with medium- to large-sized mammals, which pose a high risk of damage to aircraft and human safety. Despite the identified threat that mammals can pose to aircraft, few works have beenpublished on ways to rank and predict the risk of mammalian species to aircraft. This study used remote camera trap data collected from an array of wildlife camera traps at the Prince George International Airport (YXS), Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, to calculate strike risk forvarious species of mammals involved in runway incidents between January 2012 and December 2018. Carnivores such as red foxes and coyotes were found to be the highest risk mammal species at YXS, but foxes were found airside infrequently compared to coyotes. Binary logistic regression modellingwas used in an attempt to predict variables leading to runway incidents with coyotes at YXS. The highest supported logistic regression model predicting coyote incidents included the variables ‘weekday’, ‘month’ and ‘season’. Although data from camera trapsdid not help to predict incidents, trend data collected from camera traps mirrored coyote incident data, suggesting that camera traps are useful for capturing times of the day and seasons of the year in which coyotes are active at the airport. Suggestions are provided as to how cameras mightbe used to track the movement of animals more accurately and what other data could be useful in helping to build risk assessments and models to predict aircraft incidents with mammals of interest.

AB  - To address concerns about regional physician shortages within British Columbia, the University of British Columbia began distributing its undergraduate medical curriculum across multiple campuses (ie, urban Vancouver, small urban Victoria, and rural Prince George) in 2005. The distribution of the pathology curriculum required meeting 3 specific challenges: (i) implementation of high-quality technologies to facilitate distribution; (ii) recruitment of pathologists to teach; and (iii) creation of an electronic pathology learning center. Technological needs were met by a state-of-the-art audiovisual system allowing simultaneous interactive didactic sessions across all 3 sites, and by the use of a digital “virtual slide” system. Recruitment of pathologist educators proved challenging owing to comparatively limited staffing levels at the rural site. A physical and virtual pathology learning center was developed to assist students in self-directed study. Student performance on pathology examinations has proven to be essentially identical pre- and post-distribution, and is equivalent across all 3 sites. Quantitative and qualitative student survey data show that distributed pathology instruction is overwhelmingly well received by medical students at all sites, that pathologists' expertise is very important to students, and that pathology is one of the most popular components of the distributed curriculum. Pathology education continues to be a vital part of a distributed undergraduate medical program, and student grades and feedback demonstrate the value of the teaching and the technologies we have used. To be implemented successfully, the distribution of pathology education requires considerable financial and infrastructure investment, and ongoing commitment from pathologists and university administrators.

AB  - Health care system partners in BC are shifting toward delivering primary care approaches that are socially accountable and reflect the needs of all health partners. A partnership development and strategies workshop that was held on the Gidimt'en territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation was designed to support health care system transformation in Northern BC. Indigenous female health leaders led the workshop planning processes and facilitation to ensure that gender and racial power imbalances were addressed and the planning work was grounded in appreciation and respect for Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Workshop participants included partners from Northern Health, the First Nations Health Authority, northern divisions of family practice, medical staff associations, the Ministry of Health, academia, First Nations communities, and the community at large.Together, they used the"breathing and weaving" approach, an adaptation of the appreciative inquiry method, to discuss health care priorities. The outcomes of the workshop included the development of relationships among participants that were built on trust, mutual understanding, and respect; an increased appreciation of participatory, decolonized workshop design that included traditional healing; and a commitment to ongoing collaboration and health care system transformation to improve health and wellness service access and outcomes.

AB  - In 2015, an infrared camera installation was configured to monitor the shell temperature of the lime kiln at Canfor's Prince George Pulp & Paper mill in Prince George, British Columbia. The camera installation produced a 22-point temperature profile along the length of the kiln. Preliminary data analysis was performed to assess the capability of the thermal cameras to predict product residual carbonate compared to conventional measurements. The cameras were also used for early detection of ring formation, brick loss, and other undesirable conditions. This paper provides a detailed review of the set-up and key findings from this project, which showed that the camera-based set-up improved residual carbonate predictability by up to 67% versus conventional measurements. The paper will also demonstrate the significant benefit of providing quick and easy detection of harmful operating conditions from thermal image analysis, leading to decreased shell damage, repair costs, and downtime.

AB  - Water, surface sediments, and <40 cm rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and northern pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus oregonensis) were collected from Pinchi Lake, British Columbia, and from several nearby reference lakes. Hg concentrations in sediment samples from Pinchi L. were highly elevated compared to sediments from reference lakes, especially in sites adjacent to and downstream of a former Hg mine. In both fish species examined, Hg concentration was positively related to age and/or fork length. In northern pikeminnow, Hg concentrations were also positively related to trophic level (deltaN). Hg concentrations in both fish species were highest in Pinchi L., and were higher in pikeminnow than in rainbow trout of similar size. Average Hg concentrations in small rainbow trout from all lakes, including Pinchi L., were lower than dietary levels reported to cause reproductive impairment in common loons (Gavia immer); however, Hg levels in small pikeminnow from Pinchi L. were sufficiently high to be of concern. The risk for Hg toxicity in the study area is greatest for animals that consume larger piscivorous fish such as larger northern pikeminnow or lake trout, which are known from previous studies to contain higher Hg concentrations.

AB  - This paper addresses the 'immigrant-Aboriginal parallax gap' whereby material connections between immigration and Indigenous dispossession are rarely examined in tandem by considering ways in which the Canadian media frames Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers. Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism.

AB  - Impact of lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe was determined in six sub-areas of Forest Inventory Zone H, near Prince George, British Columbia, using a roadside survey and measurements of mature infected trees. Mistletoe effects on DBH were evident only in two of the sub-areas surveyed (Westlake and Nechako). After correcting DBH measurements for competition (stand density), dbh of 100–120 year old and 121–150 year old trees was reduced 10% and 17% respectively, in the highest mistletoe rating (DMR) category (4.5–6.0). Height/DBH relationships were affected by dwarf mistletoe only in the Nechako area. Mistletoe effects in the Nechako and Westlake areas, in stands older than 120 years with mistletoe ratings of 4.5–6.0, resulted in volume reductions of 28–42%, depending on the effects of mistletoe on height. Further losses might accrue in lodgepole pine stands if clear-cut harvesting were restricted by the BC Forest Practices Code, unless infected stems are selectively removed.

AB  - ABSTRACT. This article examines contemporary political movements among Dakelh First Nations in British Columbia that have challenged Western modernity's fixation with a future achieved through industrial progress. Aboriginal people have been especially assertive in politicizing the connections between time and place through the display and performance of memory in forms as diverse as life history narratives, the cultural landscape, media and grass-roots development projects. Such constructions suggest that future developments in traditional lands must come through an engagement with the past - its meanings, practices, and significance in the particular places of cultural and economic production. I explore how Dakelh territories serve as sites for imagining and enacting alternative political and development agendas. I argue that these territories have increasingly become spaces forged in the margins of modernity's binary oppositions of self-other, nature-culture and future-past. This finding is not meant to marginalize indigenous territories conceptually or politically, but rather to recognize their centrality to contemporary provincial politics where margins - both geographic and discursive - have become central locations for pursuing sovereignty over land and nation.

In-depth personal interviews with the hereditary chiefs and concept mapping were used to identify social-ecological linkages in Wet'suwet'en culture to inform the development of culturally sensitive social criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) in this region. The preliminary results demonstrate how the CatPac II software tool can be applied to identify key component concepts and linkages in local definitions of SFM, and translate large volumes of (oral) qualitative data into manageable information resources for forest managers and decision-makers.

AB  - Few studies to date examine the cumulative effects of climate change and resource development on social-ecological systems, such as watersheds. In partnership with a watershed alliance we endeavoured to understand the interplay of climate change and resource exploitation impacts in the Nechako River Basin, which drains an area of 52,000 km2 in northwestern Canada as part of the Fraser River Basin. Existing regional climatic studies show a clear warming trend over the last century and a projected mean temperature increase of ∼2°C for the 2050s. Watershed stakeholders determined that hydroelectric development and forestry activities interrelate particularly closely with climate impacts related to ecosystem function, water supply, and (resultantly) community well-being. Mining and oil and gas development do not currently represent a high level of concern, but will become problematic with future resource exploitation or climatic changes. The process was effective in grounding specific, day-to-day realities of climate change. The results illustrate the importance and challenge of considering both impact sources in tandem, and should inform ongoing regional planning and monitoring efforts. A major barrier to performing this type of assessment with regional stakeholders is communicating, cross-referencing, and visualizing the interrelationships between climate change and resource development, which are independently highly complex. Les changements climatiques et le développement des ressources dans les bassins versants : leçons tirées du bassin de la rivière Nechako, Canada À ce jour, peu d'études se sont intéressées aux effets cumulatifs des changements climatiques et du développement des ressources sur les systèmes socio-écologiques, tels que les bassins versants. Nous avons entrepris, en partenariat avec un regroupement d'organismes de bassin versant, de comprendre l'interaction entre les effets des changements climatiques et du développement des ressources sur le bassin de la rivière Nechako qui draine les eaux d'un territoire couvrant 52 000 km2 et faisant partie du bassin de la rivière Fraser dans le nord-ouest du Canada. Les études climatiques régionales réalisées à ce jour montrent une nette tendance au réchauffement au cours du siècle dernier et une augmentation de la température moyenne projetée de ∼ 2 °C à l'horizon 2050. Les parties prenantes du bassin versant ont établi que les activités de développement hydroélectrique et de foresterie sont intimement liées avec les effets du climat agissant sur la fonction écosystémique, l'approvisionnement en eau, et finalement le bien-être communautaire. Les secteurs de l'extraction minière et de l'exploration pétrolière et gazière ne suscitent actuellement pas de fortes inquiétudes, bien qu'ils risquent de poser problème à l'avenir avec l'exploitation des ressources ou les changements climatiques. Le processus a permis d'identifier des réalités particulières liées aux changements climatiques. Les résultats font ressortir l'importance et le défi de tenir compte simultanément des deux sources d'effets. Ils sont également susceptibles d'éclairer les mesures prises en matière de planification régionale et de surveillance. Une difficulté de ce type d'évaluation faisant appel aux parties prenantes régionales est de communiquer, d'effectuer des recoupements, et d'identifier les liens réciproques entre les changements climatiques et le développement des ressources, lesquels sont déjà hautement complexes.

AB  - Working within the sub-discipline of the Geographies of “(dis)Ability,” this article employs a mixed-method approach—using go-along interviews and barrier identification to explore disablement in the City of Prince George, a resource-centred city in British Columbia's northern interior. We shed light on how various habituations of ableism (e.g., inattention to accessibility planning, inadequate and weakly enforced building codes) are implicated in the disablement of individuals. In particular, we focus on ways in which the production of Prince George as a resource-centred, “winter city” reproduces inaccessibility in the landscape, as revealed in the experiences and impressions of residents living with impairment. The approach presented in this article offers unique insights into disablement as it has taken place in and through this remote, northern city. La condition permanente de l'invalidité : vivre au quotidien avec le capacitisme à Prince George, Colombie-Britannique Partant de la sous-discipline des géographies de l'incapacité, cet article repose sur une approche méthodologique mixte qui comprend des entretiens en situation et une démarche d'identification d'obstacles, en vue de réaliser une étude sur l'invalidité à Prince George, une ville d'extraction de ressources située dans la partie continentale nord de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces travaux visent à élucider les diverses insensibilisations face au capacitisme (par exemple, le manque d'intérêt pour l'aménagement de l'accessibilité, les codes de construction inadéquats et peu appliqués) et comment celles-ci ont des conséquences directes sur l'invalidité des individus. Il est question plus particulièrement des moyens par lesquels la production de Prince George en tant que « ville hivernale » d'extraction de ressources confère au milieu un caractère d'inaccessibilité, tel que manifesté à travers l'expérience et les impressions de résidents vivant avec un handicap. De nouvelles perspectives sur l'invalidité vécue au quotidien dans cette ville nordique éloignée se dégagent de l'approche proposée dans cet article.

AB  - Societies produce the space in which they operate through social practices that visualize, administer, and use lands and resources. Because Native peoples have held relatively little political power, their ability to influence the production of space has received little attention. Yet the superimposition of Euro-Canadian social practices onto Native spaces rarely erased native spatiality, but rather created a territory made up of shared and hybrid spaces which resulted from the interaction of Native and Euro-Canadian societies. This paper suggests that the social processes involved in the production of space are perhaps most visible when two parties are negotiating the allocation and management of lands and resources. In the 1970s the Tl'azt'en engaged in negotiations over the construction of a railway through their territory. Through the negotiations Tl'azt'en social and economic goals were inscribed to a significant degree in the spatial organization of the territory. Like current treaty negotiations, the 1970s negotiations involved compromises by both parties, and resulted in the creation of new hybrid social spaces which reflected the goals and strategies of both groups. Les sociétés produisent l'espace dans lequel elles opèrent à travers des pratiques sociales qui visualisent, administrent et utilisent les terres et les ressources. Parceque les peuple Natifs ont eu relativement peu de pouvoir politique, leur capacitéà influencer la production de l'espace a reçu peu d'attention. Cependant, l'imposition de pratiques sociales Euro-Canadiennes sur les espaces Natfs a rarement effacé la spatialité indigené, mais a plutôt crée un territoire composé d'espaces partagés et hybrides, résultat de l'intéraction des sociétés indigènes et Euro-Canadiennes. Cet exposé suggère que les procédés sociaux impliqués dans lá production de l'espace sont peut-être plus visibles quand deux partis négocient l'allocation et la gestion des terres et des ressources. Dans les années 70, le peuple Tl'azt'en s'est engagé dans des négociations au sujet de la construction d'un chemin de fer à travers leur territoire. Dans ces négociations, les buts sociaux et économiques du Tl'azt'en furent inscrits à un degré significatif dans l'organisation spatiale du territoire. Comme les présentes négociations de traité, les négociations des années 1970 ont impliqué des compromis par les deux partis, et ont résultéà la création de nouveaux espaces sociaux hybrides qui reflétaient les buts et stratégies des deux groupes.

AB  - At the Joint Review Panel (JRP) for Enbridge’s proposed Northern Gateway pipeline across northern British Columbia, many participants presenting oral statements situated themselves as decidedly ‘ordinary’ people, with rich connections to the land and landscape. Without speaking of ownership, they nevertheless made claims to the area as their home through highly detailed articulations of knowledge and experience of its natural features. For some, it was also connected to a collective, indigenous territorial claim. In all cases, we argue that it is an articulation of ‘home,’ and that this formed the basis for the political subjectivity that led to their participation in the JRP hearings. Linking the scholarly literature on home with that of political ecology, in this paper we explore the significance of the assertion of experience and knowledge of the physical environment as the basis to claim it as ‘home’ and to assert a political right to defend it from perceived intrusion.

AB  - Little research has examined individual variation in migration speeds of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in natural river systems or attempted to link migratory behavior with physiological and energetic status on a large spatial scale in the wild. As a model, we used three stocks of summer-run sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, to test the hypothesis that individual variation in migration speed is determined by a combination of environmental factors (i.e., water temperature), intrinsic biological differences (sex and population), and physiological and energetic condition. Before the freshwater portion of the migration, sockeye salmon (Quesnel, Chilcotin, and Nechako stock complexes) were captured in Johnstone Strait ( approximately 215 km from river entry), gastrically implanted with radio transmitters, and sampled for blood, gill tissue, and energetic status before release. Analyses focused solely on individuals that successfully reached natal subwatersheds. Migration speeds were assessed by an extensive radiotelemetry array. Individuals from the stock complex that migrated the longest distance (Nechako) traveled at speeds slower than those of other stock complexes. Females traveled slower than males. An elevated energetic status of fish in the ocean was negatively correlated with migration speed in most river segments. During the transition from the ocean to the river, migration speed was negatively correlated with mean maximum water temperature; however, for the majority of river segments, it was positively correlated with migration speed. Physiological status measured in the ocean did not explain among-individual variability in river migration speeds. Collectively, these findings suggest that there could be extensive variation in migration behavior among individuals, sexes, and populations and that physiological condition in the ocean explained little of this variation relative to in-river environmental conditions and energetic status. Interestingly, individual fish generally retained their rank in swimming speed across different segments, except when transiting a challenging canyon midway during the migration.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of plant foods in traditional diet of a northern foraging group, the Wet'suwet’ en Indians of northwest British Columbia. Plant foods were important in the traditional diet of the Wet'suwet'en people, although the bulk of calories, protein, minerals and B vitamins were derived from animal foods. Plant foods were consumed throughout most or all of the year. Large quantities of plant foods, notably berries and fern rhizomes, were collected and stored for winter consumption. Critical contributions from plant foods included vitamin C, fibre, and carbohydrate to balance the consumption of protein in meat. Plant foods also made significant contributions to other nutrients, including iron, calcium and magnesium. The role of plant foods in folate nutrition is still unclear. Medicinal teas, green vegetables and rice root bulbs (Fritillaria camschatcensis) contributed to vitamin C in late winter and spring.

AB  - Although not fully conceptualized as such by geographers, children and concepts of childhood were focal points of colonialism. Well into the twentieth century, Aboriginal peoples in Canada were discursively constructed by colonists as child-like subjects in need of colonial intervention in order that they ‘grow up’ into de-Indigenized Canadian citizens. Further, an important aspect of the colonial project entailed confining Aboriginal children in institutions known as Indian Residential Schools wherein, through material and curricular means, efforts were made to transform the children and dispossess them of socio-cultural identities. Much of the literature on children's geographies contemplates the socially constructed nature of childhood and critiques the pervasive (yet under-evaluated) understanding that childhood is a clear and demarcatable state of being prior to adulthood. Little attention, though, has been paid to historic or social discourses that relegated groups of people to a perpetual state of truncated childhood while simultaneously removing their children in order that those children mature into adults who embodied radically different cultural traits than their ancestors. This paper explores how Aboriginal peoples were doubly confined; firstly, by colonial constructions about children, childhood, and Othered (Aboriginal) peoples and then, secondly, within the material geographies of colonial residential schools.

AB  - This paper is anchored in two recent and concurrent openings, openings that offer opportunities for geographers to consider new modes of engaging colonial violence. The first opening is the release, in Canada, of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report and calls to action. By demanding new types of settler-subject attention to Indigenous peoples and places, it opens new spaces for extending reflection about anti-Indigenous racism and colonial violence in Canadian consciousness. The second opening is geography's growing uptake of creative and humanities-informed theories and practices. These manifest in new knowledges and practices with consequent possibilities for addressing colonial violence. I consider these two openings first by proposing changes to conversations about settler-normalized violences lived by Indigenous peoples, and, second by engaging poets working to radically re/configure language and written expression. Specifically, the paper ends with a call for geographers—particularly non-Indigenous settler geographers—to rethink ways (and forms) by which we produce knowledge, especially about colonialism and Indigenous geographies and especially in and through writing practices. The paper is experimental in form, meant to disrupt easy uptake or digestion of ideas that must remain—for settler subjects—fundamentally ragged, upsetting, and always beyond conclusion, coherence, or closure.

AB  - Indicators of wildlife health are important elements of a comprehensive approach for assessing and monitoring trends of methyl mercury (MeHg) contamination in the environment. River otters (Lontra canadensis) have been used as a model species for toxicological studies on the effects of MeHg bioaccumulation due to their position as an apex predator in aquatic systems and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Although laboratory studies suggest that sublethal MeHg exposure may have detrimental effects on wildlife, they are limited in their ability to reflect real world exposure and forecast population level effects. Few studies have identified the threshold at which MeHg exposure results in a population-level effect for wild populations of river otters in marine or fresh-water systems. We used a series of data sets collected over a 7-year period for river otter populations in central British Columbia, Canada, to assess mercury concentrations (river otter fur) and measurements of population status and health relative to a lake with an inactive and reclamated mercury mine along its shoreline (Pinchi Lake). We used a combination of remote cameras, marked individuals, hair snares, and scat counts/inventories to collect measurements of population status and health including: activity levels, population estimates, sex ratios, group sizes, litter sizes, behaviour, stress hormones, diet, and habitat quality. We found that mercury concentrations in river otter inhabiting Pinchi Lake were significantly higher than all other lakes in the study, and were also high relative to other areas in Canada and the United States. We did not, however, detect significant differences between the two lakes in many of the population parameters measured. We discuss the knowledge gaps and challenges of identifying the effects of MeHg for wild populations of mammals, determining sensitive and appropriate methods for measuring these effects, and the implications of our results for monitoring the impacts of natural resources activities. Detailed studies on population effects across a range of exposure and background conditions are required to address these data deficiencies. Typically, river otters are not included as monitoring species in environmental assessments even though their value as an indicator of anthropogenic contaminants has clearly been documented. We encourage inclusion of river otters in environmental assessments pre-, during -, and post-industrial activities as a measure of pollutant exposure and bioavailability as well as a critical first step in addressing knowledge gaps associated with contaminants and its effects on populations.

AB  - Stream temperature impacts resulting from forest harvesting in riparian areas have been documented in a number of locations in North America. As part of the Stuart–Takla Fisheries–Forestry Interaction Project, we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota. However, even modest temperature changes could alter insect production, egg incubation, fish rearing, migration timing, and susceptibility to disease, and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood.

AB  - There is a need to explicitly consider metapopulation dynamics in the development of conservation strategies for spatially structured populations. We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identified a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied >90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently, other streams make only small contributions to population abundance; however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.

AB  - Four white sturgeon were collected from the upper Fraser River near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, in the fall of 1991 and 1992. Two additional fish were taken from the Fraser River near Williams Lake, some 250 km downstream of Prince George. Samples of white muscle, red muscle, liver, and roe were analyzed for metals, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho and mono–ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorophenols to determine whether the tissues of this species were acceptable for human consumption. The concentrations of mercury in the white muscle and liver of several fish from the upper Fraser River exceeded the provincial tissue residue criteria for people who consumed low quantities of fish (i.e., 210 g wet weight/week). The concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs (expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents) in red muscle and liver of these fish exceeded the Health Canada working guidelines for the protection of human health. By comparison, white sturgeon collected in the lower Fraser River had much lower concentrations of metals and organic contaminants. The differences in contaminant burdens in fish from the two widely separated reaches of the river reflect their proximity to or distance from known contaminant sources.

AB  - The ability of paleolimnology to reconstruct historical sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) abundance was assessed at Fraser Lake, an important nursery lake in the interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Multiple sediment proxies of lake production, as well as nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, all portray relatively complacent stratigraphies, despite well-monitored changes in salmon returns over the most recent 60 years. The separation of autochthonous from total sediment organic matter did not clarify the identification of the nitrogen isotopic fingerprint of marine-derived nutrients (MDN). Slight shifts in diatom assemblages are better interpreted as responses to either early human activities in the catchment or post-Little Ice Age climate warming. The low proportion of MDN in the lake's annual budget (3% N and 7% P) is the probable reason their influence is not expressed in lake sediments. Thus, paleolimnology is incapable of providing unequivocal inferences concerning historical salmon abundances in Fraser Lake, in contrast to lakes from southern Alaska, where the same techniques have yielded unambiguous results. Sediment MDN proxies, together with catchment characteristics and escapement data, were collated for an additional nine sockeye nursery lakes spanning southern Alaska to southern BC. Primary production and biogeochemical cycling in Alaskan nursery lakes appears largely driven by MDN from sockeye returns, whereas BC lakes are more strongly influenced by allochthonous organic matter and lake-water residence times. Alaskan lakes possess the limnological features that are prerequisite for meaningful salmon reconstructions using paleolimnology, while lakes from southern BC do not. This does not suggest that MDN are unimportant in southern BC lakes but rather that they are not readily disentangled from other factors that shape the paleolimnological record.

AB  - Objectives: To explore experiences of fatigue among people with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and factors perceived to contribute to fatigue. Setting: Kelowna, Prince George, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Study design: Collaborative, qualitative methodology.Methods: Four focus groups were undertaken simultaneously with a total of 29 participants, comprising a purposive sample of men and women: 21 people with complete and incomplete SCI of high and low tetraplegia and paraplegia, 2 family members, 2 assistants and 4 occupational therapists. Interpretive analysis was grounded in the themes identified in the data.Results: Fatigue was perceived to have cognitive, emotional and physical dimensions and to exert a profound effect on the lives of many people with SCI, such that pleasurable activities were often eschewed to enable the accomplishment of more mundane tasks. Factors most consistently associated with fatigue were pain, depression and hopelessness, side effects of medications, poor quality sleep, spasticity, poor posture, diet, and the effort required to accomplish routine and self-care tasks.Conclusions: Fatigue is a complex phenomenon, interlinked with pain, depression and hopelessness that significantly diminishes the quality of life following SCI. Further research is required to provide greater understanding of this issue and to determine appropriate and comprehensive forms of intervention.

AB  - Rose Prince was a young Indigenous woman who lived during the first half of the twentieth century, spending most of her short life in a Catholic residential school near Fraser Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Shy and retiring in life, Rose's venerators believe that her understated devotion was rewarded by a postmortem miracle generally reserved only for God's greatest saints: incorruption. The Catholic hierarchy and Rose's Carrier people, though at odds on much else, are unanimous that the Lejac Indian Residential School unwittingly hosted a saint between its opening in 1922 and Prince's death in 1949, and the two groups seek together to honor her with an annual pilgrimage to her gravesite. But this fragile unanimity exists in dynamic tension with the two groups’ divergent interpretations of Prince's holiness, particularly as it pertains to the legacy of residential schools. For some within the Catholic hierarchy, Rose's sanctity provides a powerful justification for the much-critiqued assimilative educational system. For many Carrier, however, Prince is its starkest repudiation. For them, Rose was—and is—the heart of a heartless world, incarnating gentle compassion in a system that, while it trumpeted these Christian virtues, itself was notably lacking in them.

AB  - Isolating barriers that drive speciation are commonly studied in the context of two-species hybrid zones. There is, however, evidence that more complex introgressive relationships are common in nature. Here, we use field observations and genomic analysis, including the sequencing and assembly of a novel reference genome, to study an emergent hybrid zone involving two colliding hybrid zones of three woodpecker species: red-breasted, red-naped, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, S. nuchalis, and S. varius). Surveys of the area surrounding Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, show that all three species are sympatric, and Genotyping-by-Sequencing identifies hybrids from each species pair and birds with ancestry from all three species. Observations of phenotypes and genotypes of mated pairs provide evidence for assortative mating, though there is some heterospecific pairing. Hybridization is more extensive in this tri-species hybrid zone than in two di-species hybrid zones. However, there is no evidence of a hybrid swarm and admixture is constrained to contact zones, so we classify this region as a tension zone and invoke selection against hybrids as a likely mechanism maintaining species boundaries. Analysis of sapsucker age classes does not show disadvantages in hybrid survival to adulthood, so we speculate the selection upholding the tension zone may involve hybrid fecundity. Gene flow among all sapsuckers in di-species hybrid zones suggests introgression probably occurred before the formation of this tri-species hybrid zone, and might result from bridge hybridization, vagrancies, or other three-species interactions.

AB  - Regionalization, or the grouping of objects in space, is a useful tool for organizing, visualizing, and synthesizing the information contained in multivariate spatial data. Landscape pattern indices can be used to quantify the spatial pattern (composition and configuration) of land cover features. Observable patterns can be linked to underlying processes affecting the generation of landscape patterns (e.g., forest harvesting). The objective of this research is to develop an approach for investigating the spatial distribution of forest pattern across a study area where forest harvesting, other anthropogenic activities, and topography, are all influencing forest pattern. We generate spatial pattern regions (SPR) that describe forest pattern with a regionalization approach. Analysis is performed using a 2006 land cover dataset covering the Prince George and Quesnel Forest Districts, 5.5 million ha of primarily forested land base situated within the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. Multivariate cluster analysis (with the CLARA algorithm) is used to group landscape objects containing forest pattern information into SPR. Of the six generated SPR, the second cluster (SPR2) is the most prevalent covering 22% of the study area. On average, landscapes in SPR2 are comprised of 55.5% forest cover, and contain the highest number of patches, and forest/non-forest joins, indicating highly fragmented landscapes. Regionalization of landscape pattern metrics provides a useful approach for examining the spatial distribution of forest pattern. Where forest patterns are associated with positive or negative environmental conditions, SPR can be used to identify similar regions for conservation or management activities.

AB  - Background:There is growing evidence demonstrating the benefits of intradialytic cycling. However, there are relatively few centers where this practice has been adopted with no reports from hemodialysis units in rural, remote, and northern locations. Maintaining mobility and quality of life for patients on kidney replacement therapy living in remote northern communities is inhibited by inclement weather and lack of access to resources and infrastructure that support physical activity. The integration of intradialytic cycling during hemodialysis offers patients a form of safe physical activity year-round.Objective:This study focuses on better understanding the feasibility and acceptability of implementing intradialytic cycling in a remote northern geographical context.Design:A feasibility study using a mixed-methods explanatory design was adopted for this study.Setting:The research is conducted in Prince George, British Columbia.Participants:The participants are patients attending a community-based dialysis unit in remote northern British Columbia and health professionals working in the same facility.Methods:Quantitative measures were captured through cycling logbooks and quality of life measure, and qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis.Results:Six (43%) eligible patients used leg ergometers more than once for a median of 2.5 (interquartile range: 1-4) months and 87% of hemodialysis sessions. Participants cycled for a median of 65 (interquartile range: 39-76) minutes per session, with frequent variability noted between participants and different hemodialysis sessions for the same participant. Nine patients completed the European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire prestudy, with 5 (56%) also completing it poststudy. Interviews with 9 patients, 4 nurses, and 1 physiotherapist led to the identification of themes instrumental to implementation: a supportive community dialysis unit, shared responsibility, knowledge of patients/providers, and benefits associated with engagement. Themes that were identified as being key to acceptability in this remote dialysis unit were trust, connection, and engagement through common values.Limitations:Due to dialysis unit size, we had a small number of participants.Conclusions:This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing best practice in a remote community and provides insight into the elements of context and participation that contribute to acceptability in the implementation of intradialytic cycling.

AB  - Despite widespread calls to action from the scientific community and beyond, a concerning climate action gap exists. This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the role of connectedness to nature in promoting individual-level climate action in a unique setting where climate research and action are lacking: Canada’s Provincial North. To begin to understand possible pathways, we also examined whether climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and climate action. We used data collected via postal surveys in two Provincial North communities, Thunder Bay (Ontario), and Prince George (British Columbia) (n = 628). Results show that connectedness to nature has a direct positive association with individual-level climate action, controlling for gender and education. Results of parallel mediation analyses further show that connectedness to nature is indirectly associated with individual-level climate action, mediated by both climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends. Finally, results suggest that climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends serially mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and with individual-level climate action. These findings are relevant for climate change engagement and action, especially across Canada’s Provincial North, but also in similar settings characterized by marginalization, heightened vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. Drawing on these findings, we argue that cultivating stronger connections with nature in the places where people live, learn, work, and play is an important and currently underutilized leverage point for promoting individual-level climate action. This study therefore adds to the current and increasingly relevant calls for (re-)connecting with nature that have been made by others across a range of disciplinary and sectoral divides.

AB  - Plants cut at different times produce resprouts that vary in their nutritional value relative to when they are cut. To determine how vegetation management in transportation (road and rail) corridors at different times of the year could influence browse quality in the years following cutting, and how this could potentially influence encounters between herbivores and vehicles, we undertook a 3-year study. In 2001, at a wildlife viewing area near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, we established a control area and treatment areas where shrubs and trees that are used as food by moose (Alces alces) were cut at the beginning of June, July, August, September, and October. In the fall, moose were most often observed browsing the resprouts of plants cut in August (years 1 and 2 post-treatment) and September (year 3). Cumulative winter track counts were highest in the uncut control area in the years following cutting. Spring pellet counts revealed that most pellets were deposited in the uncut (years 1 and 2) and August-cut (year 3) areas during winter. With the exception of the first year after cutting, browse removal by moose was highest for plants cut later in the growing season. Overall, our findings suggest that following cutting, plants cut later in the year are selected more often by moose relative to those cut earlier. To reduce browse use of corridor vegetation in areas where concerns for moose-vehicle collisions exist, we recommend that vegetation maintenance activities be conducted in the early summer months of June and July.

AB  - The Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en of Northwestern British Columbia formerly used landscape burning to manage patches of black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), the most important plant resource of their seasonal round. In view of its significance one might postulate that managed sites would conform to a biophysical or ecological type to maximize return for effort. However, a survey of a number of traditionally managed sites indicated that managed sites are characterized by wide variation in biophysical attributes including elevation, aspect and moisture regime, while proximity to fishing sites, village sites, or sites for harvest of alpine resources proved to be a common factor in known historic berry patch sites. We conclude that characterization of the ideal site type for aboriginal V. membranaceum management must include the economy and social institutions of the local First Nations and requires an enhanced appreciation for the sophistication of the strategies and techniques employed in their management and utilization of the species.

AB  - The mental and emotional dimensions of climate change are increasingly concerning as extreme events become more frequent and severe, ecosystem destruction advances, and people become more aware of climate impacts and injustices. Research on climate emotions has rapidly advanced over the last decade with growing evidence illustrating that climate emotions can impact health, shape climate action, and ought to be considered in climate change communication, education, and engagement. This paper explores, describes, and discusses climate emotions in the context of Canada’s Provincial North: a vast region characterized by a vulnerability to climate change, remoteness, political marginalization, diverse Indigenous populations, and economies/livelihoods tied to resource extraction. Using postal survey data collected in two Provincial North communities (Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Prince George, British Columbia; N = 627), we aim to (1) describe climate emotions experienced in the context of Canada’s Provincial North, including relationships among specific emotions; and (2) examine if socio-demographic variables (gender, age, and parenthood) show a relationship with climate emotions. Results show high levels of emotional response to climate change overall, with worry and frustration as those emotions reported by the highest percentage of participants. We also find significant difference in climate emotions between men and women. A methodological result was noted in the usefulness of the Climate Emotion Scale (CES), which showed high reliability and high inter-item correlation. A notable limitation of our data is its’ underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples. The findings contribute to a greater understanding of climate emotions with relevance to similar settings characterized by marginalization, vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. We discuss our findings in relation to the literature and outline future research directions and implications.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss an innovative course offered as a partnership between the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) (Canada), the Prince George Chamber of Commerce (Canada) and local businesses: UNBC’s third-year undergraduate/graduate course, carbon and energy management. Design/methodology/approach The authors have all participated in the development, design and/or delivery of the course and have provided their reflections on the experience. In addition, they sought insights from students and other interested people on the impact and significance of this course. Findings Carbon and energy management is an action learning-based co-created course initiated by the Chamber to address an interest in mitigating climate change amongst local businesses. Among businesses, the carbon economy is under considerable discussion. The increased awareness of climate change, and the need to better manage carbon, has led to local businesses eager to reduce greenhouse gases but lacking the expertise necessary. UNBC students (undergraduate and graduate) learn innovative and practical skills through creating carbon footprint analyses for small- to medium-sized business/non-profit clients, providing recommendations on reducing reliance on fossil fuels and formally presenting their findings to their clients. After five years, 46 businesses and non-profit organizations have participated in the course along with over 30 students and 5 separately hired student interns. The Chamber is now rolling out the program for Canadian Chamber of Commerce interested in similar community–university partnerships. Originality/value This paper describes a course that is a novel approach to university–community partnerships, both in approach and focus area. The linking, through the course, of small- to medium-sized businesses with the provision of plans for carbon reduction developed by university students is an unusual approach. However, there is significant value to all partners in the approach. Allowing the main community partner to serve as the lead in the project also offers an unusual experience and perspective for the university partner, as often such partnerships are largely driven by the post-secondary institution’s interests and needs, which can create a challenging power dynamic. Instead, the course offers a lesson in how a university can be clearly in service to the community at the community’s invitation. Finally, this paper offers reflections on the value of this type of project for creating sustainability initiatives from the perspective of all participants, students, faculty, university administration, city government, participating businesses and the Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating the critical need for understanding a project as an intersection of all participating actors.

AB  - Background.Mental health and wellbeing, including addressing impacts of historical trauma and substance use among young people, has been identified as a key priority by Indigenous communities and leaders across Canada and globally. Yet, research to understand mental health among young Indigenous people who have used drugs is limited. Aims.To examine longitudinal risk and strengths-based factors associated with psychological distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs. Method.The Cedar Project is an ongoing cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver, Prince George, and Chase, British Columbia, Canada. This study included participants who completed the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, returned for follow-up between 2010 and 2012, and completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Adjusted linear mixed-effects models estimated effects of study variables on changes in area T-scores of psychological distress. Results.Of 202 eligible participants, 53% were women and the mean age was 28 years. Among men, childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect), any drug use, blackouts from drinking, and sex work were associated with increased distress. Among women, childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect), blackouts from drinking, and sexual assault were associated with increased distress, while having attempted to quit using drugs was associated with reduced distress. Marginal associations were observed between speaking their traditional language and living by traditional culture with lower distress among men. Conclusion.Culturally safe mental wellness interventions are urgently needed to address childhood trauma and harmful coping strategies that exacerbate distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs.

AB  - There is a paucity of research that evaluates climate change adaptation actions. Academics partnered with the City of Prince George, in Northern British Columbia, Canada, for over five years to explore and address adaptation. After an adaptation strategy was created, eight initiatives oriented towards implementation were pursued. These initiatives focused on incorporating adaptation into local plans, and in-depth explorations of impacts related to forests, river flooding and effects to transportation infrastructure. This article summarizes the initiatives pursued and assesses their effectiveness through semi-structured interviews with local planners, engineers, managers, community champions and politicians. The initiatives deemed to be most successful—and most likely to continue after the project has ended—focus on topics that: are of high public concern; have clear cost implications; incorporate adaptation into policy; and/or promote tangible outcomes. Results highlight both benefits and drawbacks associated with ‘mainstreaming’ adaptation into existing plans and strategies, and the importance of building and maintaining internal capacity.

AB  - Spawner escapements for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are frequently estimated by using a variety of methods over time. To evaluate temporal patterns in escapements, the data must be standardized. In our study, we standardized escapement data from 1980 to 1998 for the chinook salmon O. tshawytscha of the Nechako River in British Columbia. This particular stock and period were chosen because (1) escapement had been estimated by several methods that could be standardized and (2) escapement estimation methods and data had previously been summarized in detail and were readily available. The area-under-the-curve method of estimating escapement had been used since 1987, and after minor adjustments in 1989, methods had remained constant. To evaluate whether differences in methods for earlier years affected analysis of trends in escapement over time, we converted the data for years 1980–1988 to area-under-the-curve equivalents. The mean of reported escapements for the 1980–1988 period increased from 18% to 22% after standardization. The increase demonstrates the importance of standardizing data when analyzing trends in Pacific salmon escapement data.

AB  - Background:Incarceration and homelessness are closely related yet studied rarely. This article aimed to study the incarcerated homeless and identify specific vulnerabilities, which rendered them different from the nonincarcerated homeless. It also aimed to describe the homeless population and its significant involvement with the criminal justice and enforcement system.Methods:Data were derived from the British Columbia Health of the Homeless Study (BCHOHS), carried out in three cities in British Columbia, Canada: the large urban center Vancouver (n = 250), Victoria (n = 150) and Prince George (n = 100). Measures included socio-demographic information, the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus.Results:Incarcerated homeless were more often male (66.6%), were in foster care (56.4%) and had greater substance use especially of crack cocaine (69.6%) and crystal methamphetamine (78.7%). They also had greater scores on emotional and sexual abuse domains of CTQ, indicating greater abuse. A higher prevalence of depression (57%) and psychotic disorders (55.3%) was also observed. Risk factors identified which had a positive predictor value were male gender (p < .001; odds ratio (OR) = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7?4.4), a diagnosis of depression (p = .02; 95% CI: 1.1?4.4) and severe emotional neglect (p = .02; 95% CI: 1.1?3.2) in the childhood.Conclusion:Homeless individuals may be traumatized at an early age, put into foster care, rendered homeless, initiated into substance use and re-traumatized on repeated occasions in adult life, rendering them vulnerable to incarceration and mental illness.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze relationships between the variability of MODIS derived snow covered area (SCA) and flood dynamics for the management of reservoirs. The study was conducted in the Nechako River Basin in British Columbia (Canada). Relationships were analyzed between daily SCA calculated from filtered MODIS images and the fraction of the flood volume that had already entered the reservoir during the snowmelt period. Results indicate a robust (R2 = 0.87) and significant (p < 0.001) correlation over a 14-years (2000-2013) period. A similar analysis was conducted for each sub-basin, producing an even more robust relationship (R2 = 0.90) for the Tahtsa Lake sub-basin. Two distinct relationships corresponding to years with either large or small spring runoff were identified by classifying years according to their maximum snow water equivalents (SWE), peak inflows and flood volume, thus improving the correlations. These empirical relationships are a simple forecasting tool that does not require any additional data other than MODIS SCA and SWE measurements. This straightforward approach can be applied to other mountainous watersheds dominated by snow accumulation and melt.

AB  - The water resources of Canada are today, and have always been, of major importance to the welfare of Canadians. Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply–management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of ‘megaprojects’, often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, ‘First Nations’ peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects – especially dam construction – on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T’En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan).

AB  - The management of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and/or exurban settings is of growing concern as these mammals, along with coyotes, cougars and others, begin to re-colonize areas from which they had been extirpated. Urban and exurban landscapes can offer much needed habitat to these space-demanding creatures, thereby buffering habitat losses in other areas and protecting populations of these species, but only if conflicts between these animals and humans can be managed and minimized. In the case of urban black bears, they can become quickly labled as a “problem” bear if they become too reliant on human garbage or other food sources such as fruit trees. A “problem” bear usually becomes a dead bear. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, UNBC researchers undertook two surveys of Prince George over a 3 year period and a companion survey in the city of Coquitlam, BC to examine attitudes towards urban bears. The research found that residents of both cities, in spite of regular and close encounters with black bears, strongly supported the presence and preservation of bears within an urban setting, largely due to conservation concerns. Both communities were supportive of non-lethal control of “problem bears” and supported the use of warnings and fines to discourage human behaviors that created human-bear conflicts over lethal controls. These findings offer support for municipal governments to reconsider approaches to urban bear management.

AB  - Across rural North America, aboriginal and nonaboriginal people have formed strategic alliances to defend what are perceived to be common resources and attachments to place. Thus far, little is known about how these partnerships have factored into indigenous pursuits of territorial autonomy. This article describes how the Cheslatta T'en, a Dakelh (Carrier) community in north-central British Columbia, established a measure of control over their homeland after forming an alliance with local nonnative residents. Cheslatta leaders used cultural exchanges and social networks generated by the alliance to fashion territorial initiatives that, when taken together, channel popular environmentalism, provincial forestry policies, and ancestral ethnoecology into collective identity, action, and authority. As a result, the band has attained political influence over its traditional lands without participating in the province's treaty settlement process. Interethnic partnerships in rural areas are particularly relevant to political ecology because they reveal how the common experience of powerlessness can generate new forms of resource management that synthesize diverse constructions of nature. In this way, the paper contributes to the growing empirical work on such alliances and to emerging frameworks for a political ecology of social movements. It also adds to the ethnographic literature on the colonial encounter in British Columbia by highlighting the role of interethnic collaboration in contemporary rural resource management projects.

AB  - BACKGROUND:Young Indigenous people, particularly those involved in the child welfare system, those entrenched in substance use and those living with HIV or hepatitis C, are dying prematurely. We report mortality rates among young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia and explore predictors of mortality over time. METHODS:We analyzed data collected every 6 months between 2003 and 2014 by the Cedar Project, a prospective cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios using Indigenous and Canadian reference populations. We identified predictors of mortality using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS:Among 610 participants, 40 died between 2003 and 2014, yielding a mortality rate of 670 per 100 000 person-years. Young Indigenous people who used drugs were 12.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.2–17.5) times more likely to die than all Canadians the same age and were 7.8 (95% CI 5.6–10.6) times more likely to die than Indigenous people with Status in BC. Young women and those using drugs by injection were most affected. The leading causes of death were overdose (n = 15 [38%]), illness (n = 11 [28%]) and suicide (n = 5 [12%]). Predictors of mortality included having hepatitis C at baseline (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.47–5.16), previous attempted suicide (adjusted HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.01–3.50) and recent overdose (adjusted HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.00–8.09). INTERPRETATION:Young Indigenous people using drugs in BC are dying at an alarming rate, particularly young women and those using injection drugs. These deaths likely reflect complex intersections of historical and present-day injustices, substance use and barriers to care.

AB  - Drawing on ongoing patterns of learning and relationship, this paper offers a reflection and acknowledgement on the notable influence of two rivers and their role as respected and highly valued “eco-social elders”: The Taieri River in Otago, New Zealand, and the Nechako River in northern British Columbia, Canada. The paper is motivated by the question: “If a river has ‘voice’, what can be learned from the emergence arising from rivers ‘in conversation’?”. At the heart of the reflection are the themes of confluence and emergence—ways in which we grasp the coming together of things, especially when that combination is more than the sum of their parts. The paper aims to explore a “conversation” between the river teachings of the Taieri River and the Nechako River, identifying examples of patterns and connections between distinct river “voices,” and how these may contribute to emergence and ongoing conversations among different rivers and their teachings. The paper commences with an introduction to both rivers, identifying points of direct comparison and contrast, then moving to explore themes of confluence, weaving and emergence, combining ecological, metaphorical, and personal perspectives. The conversation then progresses downstream to river–ocean relationships, reflecting on rivers as eco-social elders that inspire conversations, provide a sense of home, and offer a point of reference to consider the wider influence on rivers and waterways on the health of diverse species within catchments and across the planet.

AB  - Many studies have defined the interrelationships between climate, forest disturbance, and runoff at small scales (500 km2). In this study, we explore the relationship between climate, extreme forest fire seasons, mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks, and runoff in eight large watersheds within the Fraser and Peace drainage basins in British Columbia (BC), Canada from 1981–2019. Using a climate index based on precipitation and air temperature anomalies, we find extreme forest fire seasons (those that burned >5% of a watershed's area) are most likely to occur when a warm/dry summer is preceded by multiple seasons of cool/wet conditions. Using the climate suitability class (CSC) model to explore the relationship between climate and MPB outbreaks, we validate previous findings that lower-than-average precipitation, warm growing season temperatures, and lack of extremely cold temperatures during winter are connected to MPB outbreaks within central BC. However, the CSC model needs improvements to accurately assess MPB suitability in northern watersheds that are located outside the model's calibration region, either through weighted variables or lower degree day thresholds. Minimal runoff response occurs from these forest disturbances, with the most prominent runoff change being related to the 2014 fire season in the Osilinka and Mesilinka watersheds. The limited effects of forest disturbance on annual runoff are likely related to large watershed sizes, low percentages of disturbed area in some study watersheds and post-MPB forest dynamics. These results provide valuable insight into the interrelationships of climate, forest disturbance and runoff in large Canadian boreal forested watersheds.

AB  - Watersheds are settings for health and well-being that have a great deal to offer the public health community due to the correspondence between the spatial form of the watershed unit and the importance to health and well-being of water. However, managing watersheds for human health and well-being requires the ability to move beyond typical reductionist approaches toward more holistic methods. Health and well-being are emergent properties of inter-related social and biophysical processes. This paper characterizes points of connection and integration between watershed management and public health and tests a new conceptual model, the Watershed Governance Prism, to determine the prevalence in peer-reviewed literature of different perspectives relating to watersheds and public health. We conducted an initial search of academic databases for papers that addressed the interface between watershed management (or governance) and public health themes. We then generated a sample of these papers and undertook a collaborative analysis informed by the Watershed Governance Prism. Our analysis found that although these manuscripts dealt with a range of biophysical and social determinants of health, there was a tendency for social factors and health outcomes to be framed as context only for these studies, rather than form the core of the relationships being investigated. At least one cluster of papers emerged from this analysis that represented a cohesive perspective on watershed governance and health; “Perspective B” on the Watershed Governance Prism, “water governance for ecosystems and well-being,” was dominant. Overall, the integration of watershed management/governance and public health is in its infancy.

AB  - Local governments can encourage proactive action on climate change by incorporating adaptation measures into long-term planning documents. The authors undertook action-oriented, case study research by participating (as adaptation experts) in the process to create a sustainability and land use policy plan for the City of Prince George, Canada. A range of adaptation measures was incorporated into both documents. Factors enabling the incorporation of adaptation included a high level of local awareness, an existing adaptation strategy to draw upon and the flexible process used to create the plans. Challenges such as a lack of priority, limited policy direction and perceptions of climate change as solely an environmental challenge persist as barriers to incorporating adaptation into local plans, particularly in smaller centres.

AB  - Field data and a forced, modal-based, two-layer, variable-cross-section model (TLVC) were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in a large multibasin reservoir, Nechako Reservoir (British Columbia, Canada). The TLVC showed that most of the thermocline deflections at the dam could be accounted for by considering the first two basins upstream of the dam, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and that the thermocline deflections were dominated by the first (H1) and second (H2) horizontal baroclinic modes of the combined basins. Calibration of the TLVC against the field data showed that the H1 and H2 modes were strongly damped, with effectively no free thermocline oscillations. This strong damping had two effects: high coherence between the wind and thermocline deflections and phase lags between thermocline deflections at different locations. The damping in Nechako Reservoir is stronger than in many lakes, and results from both high velocities within the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes and drag due to submerged trees, which cover 30% of the bed. Our study provides a picture of overdamped baroclinic response and shows how useful information about the baroclinic response in complex bathymetries can be obtained using relatively simple tools such as the TLVC.

AB  - The Aluminum Company of Canada, Limited (Alcan) has proposed completion of its hydroelectric developments to increase aluminum smelting capacity in north-central B.C. The project was started in 1950 and included the Kenney Dam on the Nechako River in the Fraser catchment area, the creation of the Nechako Reservoir, and the construction of facilities for generating power at the Kemano River on the west coast. Completion of development (Kemano Completion Proposal), at a cost of over $2 billion, would divert 84 percent of the initial mean annual discharge of the Nechako River, and 62 percent of the mean annual discharge of the Nanika River in the Skeena catchment area, to the Kemano River. The proposal offers discharges that are intended to protect Pacific salmon stocks, or, where this is not possible, mitigation of losses. This paper identifies the more obvious effects of abstraction and regulation on salmon populations and their habitat. These include interference with migration of adults, changes in the quality of spawning gravel, imposition of stress on all stages of the fish from high total gas pressures and from alterations in ambient temperature, changes in the composition of the total fish community, changes in the production and availability of food, stranding of fish, weakening or loss of cues for homing, and increased exposure to predation from fish and birds. A major difficulty in trying to relate effects to salmon populations lies in distinguishing fish numbers as determined by habitat effects, from numbers determined by the level of recruitment to the rivers as a result of exploitation by the fishery. Three approaches to the problem are: experimental design of impact assessment, modelling changes of discharge and salmon habitat, and analysis of case histories of regulated discharge. The last seems to be the most instructive per unit of effort required. As an approximation to obtaining replication of treatment effects, and to judge the reliability of prediction of effects of flow regulation, case histories of regulated salmonid rivers were examined. It was found that negative effects outnumbered positive ones, that prediction was usually incorrect, and that, even where flow regulation was implemented with the express intention of increasing numbers of salmonids the results fell short of expectations. On this evidence it appears that the outcome of a development as demanding of water as Kemano Completion is difficult to predict in precise quantitative terms and carries some risk for natural populations.

AB  - Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93% and 99%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.

AB  - A mixed-stock fishery occurs when multiple populations of a fish species are exploited together in a common area where they aggregate outside the breeding season (e.g. for feeding or overwintering), and the aggregation is known as a mixture. Recreational fishing often exploits such mixtures, and estimating the proportional contributions of populations to fisheries promotes more sustainable resource use. Ten DNA microsatellites were assayed in a mixture of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus Suckley overwintering in the Nechako River, upper Fraser River, British Columbia, and in baseline population samples from 14 tributaries putatively contributing to the overwintering mixture. A DNA microsatellite-based mixed-stock fishery analysis suggested that five populations together contributed 0.80 to the mixture. Most of the errors associated with the mixture estimates were attributable to uncertainty in baseline allele frequencies. Radiotracking data confirmed that tributary populations contributing to the mixture estimated by genetic analysis also contained individuals that moved between spawning tributaries and overwintering sites. The results better resolve habitat use by potadromous bull trout in the upper Fraser River and, in combination with assessments of baseline population-specific spawning abundances and productivity, will better inform a decision of whether or not allowing some harvest within the current catch-and-release fishery is biologically sustainable.

AB  - The archaeological record indicates the use of salmon and a wide range of terrestrial mammals at sites spanning the last millennium in the vicinity of the Nautley River on the Nechako Plateau of central British Columbia. In particular, a long record of sustained use of small and medium bodied fur-bearing mammals, especially beaver, rabbit, and muskrat, is evident, which neither prey-selection, nor fur trade intensification models adequately explain. Instead, the usage of diverse small prey is best understood in the context of the contingencies and long-term structure of the region’s salmon fishery, the social networks between communities and places, the various uses people had for these animals, and the meanings of their relationship to them.

AB  - You Are On Indian Land, a Challenge for Change documentary shot during a border-crossing blockade on Akwesasne territory (near Cornwall, Ontario) in 1969, helped interrupt the colonial legacy of Canadian cinema. Since then, activism in defense of Wet’suwet’en struggles to protect unceded territory, including remarkable uses of video and social media, carry on the transformative spark of this and other Indigenous films. Until recently, Indigenous filmmaking in Canada has mostly been relegated to informational and documentary programming because this is the genre sanctioned by colonial institutions. The commercial success of Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner (2001), disrupted this gatekeeping, and the release of Mi’kmaq filmmaker Jeff Barnaby’s Rhymes for Young Ghouls (2013) and Blood Quantum (2019) completely shattered the imposed barrier. Barnaby’s films are about the crimes of colonialism inflected through the zombie-horror and revenge-fantasy genres. This article weaves together these formative moments of Canadian documentary and fiction filmmaking with respect to issues of justice, land claims, and visual sovereignty, raising the question of what it means to represent Indigenous social struggles in popular film genres and what they say about the concept of Canadian identity.

AB  - The political-legal discourse of Indigenous rights continues to be separated from discussions of health care services in geographic scholarship, due to the ways in which political-legal, settler-colonial definitions of rights fail to take Indigenous understandings into account, as well as a distrust on the part of scholars of the limited and contingent notion of “rights.” While Indigenous rights, inherently tied in Canada to recognition by the settler-colonial state, have limited application in achieving social justice or decolonization for Indigenous peoples, we argue that Indigenous rights can be used as a complementary discourse to Indigenous resurgence, within broader discourses of Indigenous justice, to lend legal and political weight to arguments for cultural safety and human rights in health care. We draw on a study conducted with 50 Indigenous community members and 15 health services professionals in the northern city of Prince George, Canada, to elucidate how Indigenous peoples’ experiences in health care settings may be improved by giving attention to rights discourse and removing the geographic and identity-based limitations of Indigenous rights to health care in Canada.

AB  - On 1 December 2016, British Columbia’s (BC) provincial drug insurance program changed which medications in certain classes would benefit under the insurance program in an attempt to reduce expenditure. As part of the modernization, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins), Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) were affected. Prescribers and pharmacists had six months to discuss the changes with patients, and change medications if deemed necessary. Purpose: To quantify the changes made to prescriptions and to adjust to the Modernized Reference Drug Program. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two clinics in Prince George, BC. Charts for patients that were prescribed any drugs in the affected classes were reviewed to determine if, and when, they had been changed, and by which health care professional. In December 2016, a clinical pharmacist, integrated within the study clinics, informed prescribers of the changes, and made patient-specific clinical notes within the charts. The notes described the changes and recommended alternative agents and appropriate dosing in order to assist the prescriber to have a conversation with the patient regarding the switch. Results: Out of 429 unique patients, 233 patients were prescribed a Statin, 229 patients an ACEI, 110 an ARB and, 83 a CCB. Sixty-five drug changes were indicated to reflect the modernization, and with guidance from a clinical pharmacist, nurse practitioners (NPs), and family physicians (FPs), 65% of these identified drugs were switched to reflect the modernization. Community pharmacists made no drug changes in the study sample, despite the prescriptive authority and compensation available to do so. Province-wide, approximately 21% to 33% of affected drugs were switched during the same time-frame. Direct collaboration between a clinical pharmacist, working alongside NPs and FPs, was more successful in optimizing these medications when compared to standard practice, or community pharmacists alone.

AB  - The telling of birth stories (i.e. stories that describe women's experiences of giving birth) is a common and important social practice. Whereas most research on birth narratives reflects the stories of middle-class, ‘adult’ women, we examine how the birth stories told by early-age mothers interconnect with broader narratives regarding social stigma and childbearing at ‘too early’ an age. Drawing on narrative theory, we analyse in-depth interviews with 81 mothers (ages 15–24 years) conducted in Greater Vancouver and Prince George, Canada, in 2014–15. Their accounts of giving birth reveal the central importance of birth narratives in their identity formation as young mothers. Participants’ narratives illuminated the complex interactions among identity formation, social expectations, and negotiations of social and physical spaces as they narrated their experiences of labour and birth. Through the use of narrative inquiry, we examine the ways in which re-telling the experience of giving birth serves to situate young mothers in relation to their past and future selves. These personal stories are also told in relation to a meta-narrative regarding social stigma faced by ‘teenage’ mothers, as well as the public's ‘gaze’ on motherhood in general – even within the labour and delivery room.

AB  - Unusual channel-amphitheatre landforms are present in Late Pleistocene-early Holocene, subaqueous fan and delta deposits in the glacial Lake Fraser basin, central British Columbia. The lake formed during the decay of the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet and drained-11,500 years ago during a large outburst flood. The fronts of a delta and two subaqueous fans consisting of silt to fine sand are marked by branching networks of wide, nearly flat channels that terminate upstream in digitate, steep-walled amphitheatres. We propose that these channel amphitheatre landforms formed by liquefaction flowslides that were induced by the rapid drawdown of glacial Lake Fraser during the outburst flood. Similar geomorphic forms, which we believe also to be associated with rapid drawdowns of large Late Pleistocene-early Holocene lakes, occur elsewhere in North America. A recent tailings dam failure and an intentional breaching of a 100-year-old hydroelectric dam provide insights into the processes responsible for the landforms. By using geomechanical analysis, we show how rapid lake drawdown can trigger liquefaction flowslides in deposits of silt to fine sand. The novelty of our approach lies in combining geomechanical reasoning with geomorphic analogues to understand histories of ancient glacier-dammed lakes and of the glacial lake outburst floods that are sourced from them.

AB  - Background:Studies suggest that Aboriginal people in Canada are over-represented among people using injection drugs. The factors associated with transitioning to the use of injection drugs among young Aboriginal people in Canada are not well understood. Methods:The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study (2003–2007) involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants’ venous blood samples were tested for antibodies to HIV and the hepatitis C virus, and drug use was confirmed using saliva screens. The primary outcomes were use of injection drugs at baseline and tranisition to injection drug use in the six months before each follow-up interview. Results:Of 605 participants, 335 (55.4%) reported using injection drugs at baseline. Young people who used injection drugs tended to be older than those who did not, female and in a relationship. Participants who injected drugs were also more likely than those who did not to have been denied shelter because of their drug use, to have been incarcerated, to have a mental illness and to have been involved in sex work. Transition to injection drug use occurred among 39 (14.4%) participants, yielding a crude incidence rate of 19.8% and an incidence density of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years. In unadjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use was associated with being female (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–3.72), involved in sex work (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.75–6.40), having a history of sexually transmitted infection (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.07–3.78) and using drugs with sex-work clients (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.19–5.32). In adjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use remained associated with involvement in sex work (adjusted OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.45–10.71). Interpretation:The initiation rate for injection drug use of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years among participants in the Cedar Project is distressing. Young Aboriginal women in our study were twice as likely to inject drugs as men, and participants who injected drugs at baseline were more than twice as likely as those who did not to be involved in sex work.

AB  - Many current tree improvement programs are incorporating assisted gene flow strategies to match reforestation efforts with future climates. This is the case for the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), the most extensively planted tree in western Canada. Knowledge of the structure and origin of pathogen populations associated with this tree would help improve the breeding effort. Recent outbreaks of the Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) pathogen Dothistroma septosporum on lodgepole pine in British Columbia and its discovery in Alberta plantations raised questions about the diversity and population structure of this pathogen in western Canada. Using genotyping-by-sequencing on 119 D. septosporum isolates from 16 natural pine populations and plantations from this area, we identified four genetic lineages, all distinct from the other DNB lineages from outside of North America. Modeling of the population history indicated that these lineages diverged between 31.4 and 7.2 thousand years ago, coinciding with the last glacial maximum and the postglacial recolonization of lodgepole pine in western North America. The lineage found in the Kispiox Valley from British Columbia, where an unprecedented DNB epidemic occurred in the 1990s, was close to demographic equilibrium and displayed a high level of haplotypic diversity. Two lineages found in Alberta and Prince George (British Columbia) showed departure from random mating and contemporary gene flow, likely resulting from pine breeding activities and material exchanges in these areas. The increased movement of planting material could have some major consequences by facilitating secondary contact between genetically isolated DNB lineages, possibly resulting in new epidemics.

AB  - The theoretical premise of this paper is that place is an unbounded material, social and cultural agent within and through which practices of colonialism were enacted in British Columbia. Specifically, the places of British Columbia's ‘Indian’ residential schools, and the subjects who occupied them, are conceptualized as intimate sites nested within Canadian colonial and nation-building agendas that were predicated on policies of assimilation, enculturation or annihilation of indigenous people. Such conceptualizations allow for an understanding of both how colonialism was actualized against First Nations' peoples and how First Nations' peoples actively navigated and resisted that colonial project. In order to access experiences of residential school places, the article draws from published First Nations' testimonial literatures. It also draws from creative materials produced by students within the schools in order to understand how First Nations' students articulated against assimilative educational processes. The article concludes with a consideration of how nested place, First Nations' resistances, and Euro-colonial concepts of gender are circulating today with reference to a Dakelh woman (and former residential school student) under consideration for beatification in northern British Columbia.

AB  - Unlike the historic settlement of the rest of Canada, treaties with the First Nations originally occupying most of present-day British Columbia have never been finalized. Since 1993, the federal government of Canada, the provincial government of British Columbia, and approximately two-thirds of the First Nations in British Columbia have been engaged in treaty and land claim negotiations under a unique British Columbia treaty process. To date the process has produced only five agreements, three of which are fully ratified, one of which is in the ratification process, and one of which was rejected by the First Nations membership. This article reviews the history of treaties in British Columbia and uses exploratory illustrative case studies to examine two of these recent treaty negotiations—the Lheidli T'enneh First Nations and the Tsawwassen First Nations. These case studies demonstrate that treaty negotiations are very complex processes and do not always achieve mutual agreement, yet features of governance and land ownership included in these agreements have implications for land use policy and planning that affect all First Nations people in British Columbia, in Canada, and around the world.

TI  - “Show-Stopper” — Effectively Managing Project Social Risks: Improved Approaches to Aboriginal Engagement and Consultation
TY  - journalArticle
AU  - Mathewson, Andrew
AB  - A number of proposed pipelines in western and northern Canada have highlighted critical path social risks associated with effectively engaging and consulting with impacted Aboriginal rightsholders along pipeline rights-of-way. Opening up new markets for Canada’s oil sands, shale and off-shore gas resources will require an expansion of the pipeline system in northern British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. While navigating the regulatory approval process can be a formidable hurdle, a far greater challenge is how proponents manage the process of building relationships and consulting with affected Aboriginal communities. Failing to earn Aboriginal support for proposed projects can be a “show-stopper”.Exploration of new basins in Canada, driven by increased demand for energy in Asia, may compete with other land uses and constitutionally-protected rights and practices of indigenous peoples. Public, media and environmental response to new pipelines is often lead by the reaction of impacted communities. The task of identifying the social risks to a project, understanding the engagement process, fulfilling the regulatory consultation requirements of different jurisdictions, balancing impacts with benefits, managing issues and resolving disputes, communicating with the public and media effectively all require improved skills and approaches.The paper surveys the stakeholder engagement experience and differences in approaches for recently proposed major arctic gas and western oil pipeline projects, as well as pipelines to service Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities on the Pacific north coast, providing practical insights with possibly international application. Utilizing decision and risk analysis and scenario planning methodologies, applied to development of an Aboriginal engagement and consultation strategy, the paper examines how multi-billion dollar investments in new pipelines can be better secured by integrating stakeholder engagement into a project’s risk management design. With greater precision and improved approaches proponents can effectively manage social risks, reduce stakeholder conflict and associate project uncertainties.

AB  - Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh First Nation communities have traditionally used smoking, drying, and salting of fish and game as preservation methods to enhance food security. Our results showed that levels of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were significantly higher in smoked salmon samples compared to moose meats, and further, that PAH contents were also dependent on the duration of smoke processing. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was not detected in fresh or partially smoked foods, but was present in both fully smoked moose (1.4 μg/kg) and fully smoked salmon (3.6 μg/kg) meats, respectively. The total concentrations of PAH present in fully smoked meats using traditional smoke processing methods employed by Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh nations indicate that a risk assessment is required to determine the safety of these smoke-processed foods.

AB  - Objectives: Decreased quality of life in diabetes is associated with poor health outcomes. Far-infrared sauna treatments improve the quality of life for those with chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and congestive heart failure. The objective of this study is to determine whether far-infrared saunas have a beneficial effect on quality of life in those with type II diabetes. Design: This was a sequential, longitudinal, interrupted time series design study. Setting/location: The setting was Fraser Lake BC, a rural village in central British Columbia, Canada. Subjects: All patients of the Fraser Lake Community Health Center with type II diabetes were invited to participate in this study. Interventions: The study consisted of 20-minute, 3 times weekly infrared sauna sessions, over a period of 3 months. Outcome measures: To assess quality of life, subjects completed the 36-item Short-form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) questionnaire as well as “Zero-to-Ten” Visual Analogue Scales. Baseline study parameters were measured within 1 week prior to commencing sauna sessions. Postintervention measurements were collected between 1 and 3 days after the last sauna session. Results: Physical health, general health, and social functioning indices of the SF-36v2 improved. Visual Analogue Scales for stress and fatigue improved. Conclusions: Far-infrared sauna use maybe associated with improved quality of life in people with type II diabetes mellitus. Uptake of infrared saunas use is greater than the uptake of other lifestyle interventions.

AB  - It is a common practice to employ hydrologic models for assessing present and future states of watersheds and assess the degree of alterations for a range of hydrologic indicators. Previous studies indicate that the hydrologic model may not be able to replicate some of the indicators of interest, which raises questions on the reliability of model simulated changes. Hence, we initiated a study to evaluate the replicability of the streamflow changes by employing the widely used variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model for sub-basins and mainstem of the Fraser River Basin, Canada. Given that the hydrologic regime of the region is known to be influenced by teleconnections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we used hydrologic responses to the PDO and ENSO states as analogues for evaluating the model's ability to simulate climate-induced changes. The results revealed that the qualitative patterns of response, such as lower flows for the warm PDO state compared to the cool state, and progressively higher flows for the warm, neutral and cool ENSO states, were generally well reproduced for most hydrologic indicators. Additionally, while the directions of change between the different PDO and ENSO states were mostly well replicated, the magnitude of change for some of the indicators showed considerable differences. Hence, replicability of both magnitude and direction of change need to be carefully examined before using the simulated indicators for assessing future hydrologic changes, and a reliable replication increases the confidence of projected changes.

AB  - This article is a response to Kassam, Avery, and Ruelle’s insights as presented in this forum on rural science education. Topics considered include troubling the urban/rural divide in the context of Indigenous knowledge and expanding to include the common Canadian notion of the “remote”, a designation rooted in our national colonial narrative for the mythic, typically northern, wilderness sparsely inhabited by primarily Indigenous peoples. These concepts are further considered through exploration of Indigenous and allied ecological activism in Canada and the United States related to the proposed Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines. This discussion concludes with an argument for the inherent pedagogical opportunity presented by such cases for contemporary educators to engage students in consideration of wicked problems, geographically rooted cognitive diversity, and the legal, economic, ecological, and cultural underpinnings and ramifications of the current events prominent in their home communities and abroad.

AB  - A lake sediment geochemical survey was undertaken over the Nechako plateau, British Columbia, to test application of the technique to regional exploration and compare its effectiveness with results obtained elsewhere. Organic-rich lake sediment samples were collected towards the centre of approximately 500 lakes on a helicopter-assisted survey covering some 16,000 km2. Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region.

AB  - The Upper Jurassic Topley Intrusions intrude rocks of the tectonically stable Interior Plateau in central British Columbia. A stable primary remanent magnetization of both normal and reversed polarity was isolated after a.f. demagnetization in 19 of 22 sites (109 cores; 208 specimens) representing several of the plutonic units present in this sialic complex of quartz monzonite affinity near Endako, B.C. The unit mean remanence directions support some petrological correlations suggested by Carr, Bright, and White et al., but do not support others. The pole position derived from 13 sites representing 6 plutonic units with a K–Ar radiomelric age of 139 ± 4 m.y. (White et al.) is 128.6 °E, 70.0 °N(δm = 14.4°; δp = 11.4°). This position indicates a smooth polar wander path during the Jurassic between the well defined Upper Triassic and Lower Cretaceous pole positions.

AB  - The Takla Group of north-central British Columbia as originally defined contained volcanic and sedimentary rocks of Late Triassic and Jurassic ages. As redefined herein, it consists of three formations in the McConnell Creek map-area. Lowest is the Dewar Formation, composed of argillite and volcanic sandstone that is largely the distal equivalent of basic flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks of the Savage Mountain Formation. These formations are overlain by the volcaniclastic, basic to intermediate Moosevale Formation. These rocks are Upper Triassic (upper Karnian and lower Norian). They are unconformably overlain by Lower Jurassic rocks of the Hazelton Group., Le groupe de Takla, dans le centre nord de la Colombie-Britannique, dans sa définition originale comprenait des roches volcaniques et sédimentaires datant du Trias supérieur et duJurassique. Comme on le redéfinit ici, il comprend trois formations dans la région de McConnell Creek. A la base on retrouve la formation de Dewar, composée d'argillite, de grès volcaniques qui sont à peu près l'équivalent distal des coulées basiques et des roches volcaniclastiques grenues de la formation de Savage Mountain. Ces formations sont recouvertes par les roches volcaniclastiques basiques et intermédiaires de la formation de Moosevale. Ces roches datent du Triassupérieur (Karnien supérieur et Norien inférieur). Elles sont finalement recouvertes en discordance par les roches du groupe de Hazelton datant du Jurassique inférieur. [Traduit par le journal]

AB  - After many years of colonisation and oppressive policies, Indigenous cultures in Canada are reviving elements of their cultural heritage. As such, numerous Indigenous communities are working with higher learning institutions to safeguard elements of their heritage, specifically, knowledge and land-based practices. In this article, we discuss one case study of Dakelh [Indigenous) knowledge-holders that merged the practice of traditional moose-hide tanning with academic components surrounding issues in cultural heritage. With the intention of transmitting information about the field of ICH as well as safeguarding one Dakelh intangible cultural heritage element, we developed an experiential-learning university course that grounded theoretical issues in Indigenous cultural heritage. In discussing our methodology of merging the two ways of learning and teaching, including the benefits and challenges of such a course, the article elaborates how the combination of traditional and academic methodologies in a university setting can help Indigenous communities transmit their intangible cultural heritage to younger generations.

AB  - Objectives: This study sought to document the trends in drug use among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in northern British Columbia, and to discuss the public health implications. Method: We conducted a 7-year medical-chart review of all IDU-related admissions (n=2072) to an inpatient alcohol and drug cletoxification centre in Prince George, British Columbia. Primary cletoxification diagnosis was modeled onto year of admission using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: Our study demonstrated an increasing prevalence of cocaine as the primary cletoxification diagnosis in IDU-related admissions in northern BC, from 32% of all IDU admissions in 1999 to 64% in 2001, and then a relatively steady elevated rate of approximately 60% between 2001-2005. Conclusions: Given that needle exchange programs and other harm reduction services for IDUs in British Columbia are not readily available in many northern and rural areas, the risks associated with intravenous cocaine use among northern IDUs represent a serious public health challenge. Tailored harm reduction strategies should take into account the prominence of intravenous cocaine use as an HIV risk factor. In areas without well-established intravenous drug use monitoring programs, such as rural and remote areas, cletoxification treatment records may serve as important sentinels for changing drug use patterns among IDUs.

TI  - Products, features and target markets: An inquiry into Aboriginal tourism product preference of visitors to northern British Columbia.
TY  - journalArticle
AU  - Kutzner, Diana
AB  - Many Aboriginal communities in British Columbia, Canada and worldwide, are on the search for new development opportunities and industries to diversify their economies. Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris

June Wood chronicles the history of the Nechako River and its region, covering the construction of the Kenney Dam, which changed forever the flow of the river and its tributaries; the controversial Kemano Completion Project, which threatened to doom the river further still; and the subsequent battles to protect the river and the communities affected by its altered flow. She also delves into the aftermath of the devastating mountain pine beetle epidemic that severely harmed the economy of the region. An active participant in many of the fights to protect the Nechako River, Wood is one of the most qualified people to speak on behalf of the land she calls home. She passionately introduces a river whose once forceful flow has been weakened to a mere trickle and sympathetically relays the harsh realities of environmental ruin{u2014}both to the river and the forest through unnatural and natural causes{u2014}while weaving in her personal narrative of the land that holds her heart."

TI  - Mineral exploration of the Nechako plateau, Central British Columbia, using lake sediment geochemistry
TY  - thesis
AU  - Hoffman, Stanley Joel
AB  - A lake sediment geochemical survey was undertaken over the Nechako plateau, central British Columbia, to test applicability of lake sediment sampling to regional exploration. Organic-rich samples were collected near the centres of approximately 500 lakes on a helicopter-assisted survey covering some 16,000 km². It was found that lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain distinctive suites of trace metals, and that regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V, and Ga are related to differences in underlying geology, whereas anomalous levels of Cu, Mo, Pb, and Zn reflect mineralized bedrock or rock types favourable to the occurrence of sulphide concentrations. Possible mechanisms of anomaly generation were examined by detailed studies of the Capoose Lake Cu-Mo-Pb-Zn anomaly, and the Fish and Portnoy Lake Cu-Mo anomalies, both previously defined by the regional survey. Capoose Lake, a large cligotrophic lake, occupies a 'U'-shaped valley, and is characterized by Fe- and Mn-rich and organic-poor sediment. In contrast. Fish and Portnoy Lakes are small dystrophic and eutrophic ponds, respectively, completely surrounded by bogs. They contain organic-rich and Fe- and Mn-poor sediment. These studies show that anomalous accumulation of Cu, Zn, and Mo in soils, streams, and lakes reflects weathering of sulphide occurrences. Cu, Zn, Mo, Fe, and Mn concentrations associated with chemical phases comprising overburden materials were partitioned using partial extraction experiments. Cu, Zn, and Mo anomalies in soils reflecting mineral occurrences are commonly hydromorphic, although anomalies formed by mechanical processes are prominent near bedrock exposures. Cu and Zn are more firmly bound in soils and stream sediments than lake sediments, with the proportion of these elements associated with (and presumably scavenged by) amorphous Fe oxides increasing from soils to stream sediments to lake sediments. Mo is held by both amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides. An increase in the scavenging ability of amorphous Fe oxides from soils to streams sediments also is observed in the Fish and Portnoy Lakes area. However the bulk of the Cu, Zn, and Mo in the latter two lakes is apparently bound to organic matter. Metal levels within lake sediments are highly variable, and within each lake the maximum range of concentrations commonly exceeds an order of magnitude. Zones of greatest Cu, Zn, and Bo enrichment are within 10 to 150 m from shore, downslope from mineral occurrences. Metal accumulation favours zones slightly above the base of the nearshore slope, where the volume of emerging groundwater presumably is greatest. Anomalies are also generated by inputs of metal-rich fines carried by streams. Consequently for maximum anomaly contrast, samples should be collected from zones where dissolved metals or metal-rich silt and clay are flowing into a lake. Coarse clastic sediment should be avoided.

AB  - This research is a community-based oral history project under the Tl'azt'en Nation/University of Northern British Columbia Community University Research Alliance (CURA) and focuses on the area around Yeko [Cunningham Lake]. Tl'azt'en Nation is located in North Central British Columbia, approximately 65 km north of Fort St. James. The Tl'azt'enne self identify as Dakelhne.Conducting this research into the history and significance of Yeko,with members of the Tl'azt'en Nation Elders Society, ensures that Tl'azt'tenne can pass on this important history about their land and culture to the next generation. The information gathered was documented using written, audio, and video techniques, according to the wishes of the Elders/experts. Archival research of written sources has also been used to supplement the oral history. Three general themes emerged throughout the research: Importance of Community, Learning of Traditions, and Treaty. Each of the Elders discussed how close-knit the communities were in the past.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Mauren Tanyi
AB  - "This practicum report examines the concept of cultural competency in Nezul Be Hunuyeh Child and Family Services Agency in Fort St. James. This agency serves Aboriginal people from the Nak’azdli band and Tl’azten Nation, who live on reserves around Fort St. James area. The report examines how workers approach cultural competency, the challenges they face in doing so, and how these challenges impact their use of cultural competency. The methods used to conduct this study included observation, discussion with workers and key members of the community, and consultation with my practicum supervisor. It was realized that workers use cultural competency in appropriate ways. Possible reasons to support this are; the agency’s clearly stated mission statement and the level of delegation the agency has achieved. The challenges faced by workers are not directly related to the worker-client relationship, but to issues arising from the meso and macro levels. These issues could begin to be addressed through a government reconciliation process with Aboriginal people. This reconciliation process would open up ways for policy changes, which will promote more culturally relevant programs and services on reserve. It is recommended that future practicum students consider practicum in a government structure or perhaps divide time between the two agencies to understand the views stemming from both structures."

TY  - thesis
AU  - Jessica Place
AB  - "In recent years, uncertainty concerning the long term future of British Columbia's forest industry has led to renewed interest in the mining sector as a means of generating economic growth. However, the development of new operations has raised concerns around the impacts of mining activities on the environment, health and traditional ways of life of First Nations peoples. Using the proposed expansion of the Kemess mine in northern British Columbia as a case study, my research examines two First Nations' perspectives regarding the regulatory process through which environmental values may be validated and protected, and seeks to understand how First Nations' environmental values and perceptions of risk are connected to health and well-being. This case study finds that the environmental values of local populations and the perceived risks associated with resource development are neither well understood nor are they felt to be adequately addressed in environmental impact assessment (EIA) or consultative processes. As a result, health and well-being are undermined."

AB  - The Endako low-F granodiorite-type porphyry Mo deposit is hosted by the Triassic to Eocene Endako batholith, which comprises five temporally distinct plutonic suites, only one of which is mineralized. Pre-mineralization suites range in composition from diorite to granodiorite. The synmineralization Jurassic-Cretaceous Francois Lake suite includes two granodiorite- to monzogranite-bearing subsuites. Postmineralization phases include the Eocene Sam Ross Creek monzogranite. The batholith spans a silica range of 44-80 wt.% and consists of metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, low- to high-K, I-type granitoids; the Sam Ross Creek phase is an A-type granite. Positive epsilon (Nd)(T) values (+1.1 to +7.2) indicate derivation predominately from juvenile source materials, but with variable input from an older crustal component. Evidence suggests generation of older plutonic suites in a juvenile arc-type setting and younger K-rich felsic suites via recycling of juvenile arc crust without significant mantle-derived contributions. Three distinct Mo-deposition events in the Endako camp are linked to repeated generations of oxidized, highly evolved monzogranitic phases (pre-ore dykes, aplitic Nithi and Casey intrusions) belonging to both Francois Lake subsuites. Late pre-ore dykes with "Casey-like" geochemical signatures, along with massive unmineralized Casey intrusions near the Endako deposit, could reflect repeated injections from an underlying magma chamber that remained molten during the youngest Mo-deposition event. A genetic link may exist between the Sam Ross Creek phase, a pluton with Climax-type granite characteristics, and Eocene kaolinite alteration in the Endako deposit. Also, potential exists for Eocene-age Climax-type Mo mineralization within the Endako mining camp.

AB  - The structure and stratigraphy of the southeast Nechako Basin, which are poorly understood primarily because of substantial volcanic cover, are investigated in an analysis of seismic reflection, well, and potential field data. Formation and development of the SE Nechako Basin resulted in sub-basins containing Cretaceous and Eocene rocks. Interpretation reveals that dextral transtension in the Early to Middle Eocene created NNW-trending, en echelon, strike-slip faults linked by pull-apart basins, which locally contain a thickness of Eocene volcaniclastic rocks of >3 km. This structural pattern is consistent with regional observations that suggest the transfer of slip from the Yalakom fault to the north via a series of en echelon strike-slip faults. In the Middle to Late Eocene, faults associated with a change in the direction of stress, echoed by the north-trending right-lateral Fraser fault, reactivated and cut earlier structures. A simple model agrees with local observations, that northeast-directed compression was subparallel to the relic Cretaceous grain. Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous throughout the basin and may be remnants of a broader basin, or a number of contemporaneous basins, formed in a regional transpressional tectonic setting that caused northeast-directed thrusting along the eastern side of the Coast Plutonic Complex. Results suggest that thrusting affected most of the SE Nechako Basin, as observed across the Intermontane Belt to the northwest and southeast. The pattern of deposition of Neogene volcanic rocks of the Chilcotin Group was in part controlled by the Eocene structural grain, but we find no evidence of Neogene deformation.

AB  - Il est difficile d'effectuer une etude geologique a faible profondeur dans le sud-est du bassin de Nechako. La pietre qualite de l'imagerie de la sismique reflexion a faible profondeur est en partie due a la grande couverture par des roches volcaniques datant de l'Eocene et du Neogene. Les affleurements de ces roches volcaniques et du socle, datant principalement du Cretace, sont souvent caches par des depots du Quaternaire et de la vegetation. Les estimes de la vitesse de l'onde P a faible profondeur proviennent d'une inversion tomographique des premieres ondes arrivees, un outil efficace lorsque l'imagerie sismique est de faible qualite. Les vitesses du modele tomographique concordent avec la diagraphie sonique et les echantillons de laboratoire, sauf pour ceux provenant du Groupe de Chilcotin (Neogene). Des roches sedimentaires datant du Cretace ont des vitesses d'environ 2800-4200 ms(-1). Les roches des groupes de Endako et d'Ootsa Lake (Eocene), lesquelles ont des vitesses d'environ 3000-4200 ms(-1), ne peuvent pas etre differenciees en se basant sur les vitesses. La vitesse, le caractere (densite, foyer et profondeur de penetration) des rayons et les liens avec la geologie de surface et des puits limitent l'etendue sous la surface du Groupe d'Endako a proximite du puits b-82-C. Le Groupe de Chilcotin donne habituellement des vitesses (similar to 2400-3000 ms(-1)) inferieures aux vitesses correspondantes provenant de diagraphies soniques (4500-5200 ms(-1)) et de mesures en laboratoire (5000-5200 ms(-1)). Ces basses vitesses pour le modele peuvent etre causees par les roches brechiques a porosite elevee pres de la surface par rapport aux autres mesures qui ciblaient des laves massives a porosite moindre. Les vitesses moyennes les plus basses, situees au sud-est, sont reliees aux depots brechiques anormalement epais a porosite elevee du Groupe de Chilcotin. Cette conclusion concorde avec l'interpretation que le Groupe de Chilcotin est plus epais dans les vallees des anciennes rivieres.

AB  - New U-Pb ages and K-Ar dates, primarily for rocks proximal to mineral occurrences in the Fawnie Range of central British Columbia, document latest Cretaceous (ca. 74-66 Ma) continental-arc igneous activity and date associated base and precious metal mineralization. U-Pb ages of ca. 73-69 Ma for the Capoose pluton and hypabyssal to extrusive garnet rhyolites at the Capoose prospect demonstrate a latest Cretaceous age for mineralization and a likely plutonic source for mineralizing fluids. A U-Pb age of ca. 67 Ma for a late mineralized felsic dyke and two K-Ar dates (ca. 70 and 68 Ma) for hornfelsed Jurassic volcanic rocks at the Blackwater-Davidson prospect constrain a latest Cretaceous age for mineralization. A U-Pb age of ca. 74 Ma for a fine grained diorite sill that cuts a significant epithermal gold vein at the Tsacha prospect places a minimum age on mineralization at this probable Jura-Cretaceous deposit and documents latest Cretaceous magmatism. Latest Cretaceous K-Ar dates are reported for an andesite flow adjacent to the Eocene Holy Cross deposit (ca. 66 Ma), about 35 km north of the Fawnie Range, and a Kasalka Group rhyolite (ca. 68 Ma) exposed near the western margin of the Nechako Plateau. Latest Cretaceous magmatism and mineralization in the Fawnie Range represent the waning stages of Bulkley suite magmatism and porphyry-style mineralization, which was concentrated along the western margin of the Nechako Plateau at circa 88-70 Ma. The distribution of latest Cretaceous arc igneous rocks along the North American Cordilleran is reviewed and tectonic implications discussed.

AB  - Onset and termination of Eocene felsic volcanism in the Chilcotin Plateau of central British Columbia is constrained between 54.6 and 46.6 Ma by 33 new U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic age determinations. Dates were obtained from representative felsic coherent and fragmental volcanic rocks that comprise the Ootsa Lake Group. The resulting chronostratigraphy shows that magma compositions evolved from felsic to intermediate, with no spatial migration of the volcanic activity. Rhyolitic compositions are oldest; and are overlain by dacitic rocks with varied phenocrysts assemblages. In many parts of the Chilcotin Plateau, the Eocene stratigraphy is capped by distinctive vitreous black dacite lavas, which are contemporaneous with andesitic lavas of the Endako Group in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Crystallization ages from Ootsa Lake Group rocks of the Chilcotin Plateau overlap age determinations from correlative rocks of the Nechako Plateau and southern BC. Collectively, this geochronological dataset supports previous suggestions of a voluminous Early Eocene-aged (similar to 55-46 Ma) period of volcanism in the Intermontane Belt. The abrupt initiation of volcanism, as well as the wide extent, thickness, and compositions that characterize Eocene volcanic rocks may be explained by cessation of subduction and formation of a slab gap beneath British Columbia in the Early Eocene.

AB  - Following growth of the Canadian Cordillera during the Mesozoic, the southern Cordillera was subject to extension during the Paleocene and Eocene that correlated with widespread volcanic activity in south- central British Columbia, including across much of the Nechako- Chilcotin plateau. In 2008, Geoscience BC acquired 330 km of deep vibroseis reflection profiles on the plateau, mostly over the Stikinia arc terrane, but also over its eastern contact with the oceanic Cache Creek terrane. All seven seismic reflection lines reveal a strongly reflective lower crust that extends from 7 to 9 s down to the Moho, which is defined by the downward termination of reflectivity at 11- 12 s. In the uppermost crust, extension occurred by block faulting with faults soling into subhorizontal to shallowly dipping detachments above 10 km depth. Extension in the deeper upper and middle crust, which was partly controlled by antiforms likely related to earlier shortening, was accommodated on a network of anastomosing shear zones that sole out into the top of the reflective lower crust. The lower crustal reflections correlate with seismic P- wave velocities of 6.45- 6.98 km/ s, indicating that the reflective lower crust has a more mafic composition than the middle crust. As in other extensional settings, we suggest that this pervasive fabric of reflectors arises from the intrusion of mantle- derived basaltic magma into zones of ductile shearing, and that differentiation of these melts resulted in the widespread Paleocene to Eocene volcanism. Reflector dips indicate that extension was approximately east- west, consistent with north- northwest- trending horsts separated by basins filled with Paleocene to Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.

AB  - ABSTRACT: While radiation therapy for breast cancer can be omitted in some settings, in others it is now being recommended more often. Radiation is usually recommended for patients with invasive breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. Internationally, there is general agreement that regional nodal radiation is beneficial when four or more nodes are positive, and in BC adjuvant regional nodal radiation also tends to be offered to all patients with any number of positive nodes after both breast conserving surgery and mastectomy. Most patients who are found to be node-negative after mastectomy do not require adjuvant radiation therapy. However, patients at risk because of their young age or the size and biology of their tumors may be candidates for radiation therapy. Because adjuvant radiation therapy is based on pretreatment staging, it is important to accurately determine both the primary and nodal stage, especially in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Typically, radiation therapy sessions last 15 to 20 minutes and can be given over 16 to 20 sessions. Patients are monitored regularly during treatment for management of side effects, which can include fatigue, dermatitis, and breast/chest wall tenderness. In the long term there can be permanent cosmetic changes, and rare risks of lung, rib, and heart damage, as well as second malignancies.

AB  - While ministering across the immediate area, Wright was pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Fort George - a structure financed by and built on land donated by the Northern Resources Security Company (NRSC), the sole land agent in the neighbouring (and competing) townsite of Fort George.7 His concern for the state of local morals was not without selfinterest. [...]reports of immorality and vice at the Georges - South Fort George, Fort George, and, in time, Prince George - were journalistic staples. Here we see the play of anthropologist Clifford Geertz's maxim that culture is comprised of the stories that people tell themselves, about themselves, intersecting with the scholarship on boosterism in western Canada.11 Yet rather than emphasize the outward expression of the booster mindset as it has been examined on the Canadian Prairies, this treatment touches on how these depictions tinted the settler population's self-perception.12 In this, the approach also reflects on how the language of race informed and distorted local identity in the Georges.13 Ultimately, for the Interior's white settlers, the provincial government's eventual response to the Georges' competing demands satisfied few and contributed to a gnawing fear that opinion leaders and policy-makers in southern and urban British Columbia neither heard nor cared about concerns born beyond their own communities. After years of negotiation and manoeuvre, the confirmation in 1902 that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) would be built through northern British Columbia sparked the enthusiastic search for prime locations along the anticipated line.15 An immediate point of interest was the region near the junction of the Nechako and Fraser Rivers, where commentators believed the line would cross on route from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast (see Figures 1 and 2).16 While the railway, the federal government, and the provincial governments argued, pushed, and prodded each other into concessions and agreements, settlers and adventurers ventured into the northern Interior, and South Fort George emerged as an unincorporated cluster of homes, roads, and businesses huddled alongside the paddlewheel landing established on the Fraser River in early June 1909.17 Founded by Alexander G. Hamilton in 1906 when he opened a store at the site, the community owed its name to the fact that it lay south of Fort George, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) post sited by fur trader Simon Fraser in 1807.18 That post rested on a separate parcel of land south of Fort George Reserve

AB  - In some hydrological systems, mitigation strategies are applied based on short-range water temperature forecasts to reduce stress caused to aquatic organisms. While various uncertainty sources are known to affect thermal modeling, their impact on water temperature forecasts remain poorly understood. The objective of this paper is to characterize uncertainty induced to water temperature forecasts by meteorological inputs in two hydrological contexts. Daily ensemble water temperature forecasts were produced using the CEQUEAU model for the Nechako (regulated) and Southwest Miramichi (natural) Rivers for 1–5-day horizons. The results demonstrate that a larger uncertainty is propagated to the thermal forecast in the unregulated river (0.92–3.14 °C) than on the regulated river (0.73–2.29 °C). Better performances were observed on the Nechako with a mean continuous ranked probability score (MCRPS) &lt;0.85 °C for all horizons compared to the Southwest Miramichi (MCRPS ≈ 1 °C). While informing the end-user on future thermal conditions, the ensemble forecasts provide an assessment of the associated uncertainty and offer an additional tool to river managers for decision-making.

AB  - MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in VV polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the − 3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 91.5% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow-free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

AB  - A new method for regression analysis of longitudinal counts is applied to data from Prince George, British Columbia, previously analysed by Knight et al. The data consist of daily recordings of the number of emergency room visits for each of four categories of respiratory diseases, along with measurements of meteorological variables and air pollution. We use a state-space model assuming conditionally independent Poisson counts for the four categories given a latent morbidity process, the latent process being a gamma Markov process. The main objective of the investigation was to examine the relationship between air pollution and respiratory morbidity, taking into account seasonality and meteorological conditions. We found that total reduced sulphur significantly influences the expected number of emergency room visits for the four disease categories, in agreement with the conclusion by Knight et al. However, our final model is simpler than theirs; in particular we found no evidence of seasonal variation beyond that explained by the meteorological variables.

AB  - Alcan Smelters & Chemicals Ltd. initiated construction of the final phase of the Kemano Completion Project in north-central British Columbia to divert additional water from the Nechako Reservoir to the existing powerhouse. The Nechako Reservoir was created by the construction of the Kenney Dam in Nechako Canyon, a natural barrier to salmon migration. The Nechako River downstream of Nechako Canyon supports important runs of sockeye and chinook salmon. This additional diversion of Nechako River flow creates the potential of high water temperatures and increased thermal stress to migrating sockeye salmon enroute to their spawning grounds in Nechako River tributaries. To achieve specific downstream water temperature objectives during sockeye salmon migration each summer, a two-level outlet facility adjacent to Kenney Dam is to be constructed to release cooling water at 10°C to the Nechako River. Results of mathematical modelling of Nechako River water temperatures show that, based on specified design criteria, a maximum Kenney Dam release of 167 m 3 /s at 10°C would be required to meet the downstream water temperature objectives.

AB  - In Canada, First Nations rights and title to lands and resources have been recognized however, reconciliation of land use conflicts has proven difficult. Co-management is emerging as a potential process for sharing authority between First Nations and others, though evaluative tools are required. This thesis builds on research by UNBC and Tl'azt'en Nation on adaptive forest co-management of the John Prince Research Forest. Through a case study, it presents a method for working with local First Nations to develop measures of co-management success. The method engages 'local experts' through a modified Nominal Group Technique, with an iterative, participatory approach. Results include a set of locally-defined measures on cultural revitalization, characteristics of effective Tl'azt'en measures, and a method evaluation. The method successfully engaged participants in generating effective measures, and constructive participant feedback was received. Implementation of a monitoring program by the John Prince Research Forest is required prior to complete evaluation.

AB  - Freshly caught salmon were hot smoked with the traditional smoke processing methods of the Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh First Nations communities, producing both half-smoked and fully smoked food products. To ascertain the nature of antimicrobial effects related to the smoking process, the residue content of 16 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and total PAHs of smoked products were determined and correlated with smoking process duration. When compared with fully smoked samples, partially smoked fish had significantly less total PAHs and were composed solely of low-molecular-weight components, with phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, and napthlalene, respectively, being the most abundant. In contrast, fully smoked products possessed significantly higher levels of low- and high-molecular-weight PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene. Sequential extractions of water, ethyl acetate, and hexane were performed to identify antimicrobial activity imparted by the traditional smoking process. No activity was observed in water or ethyl acetate extractions, whereas hexane extracts were inhibitory to Staphylococcus aureus, with more inhibition observed in fully smoked samples when compared with partially smoked samples. This study provides evidence that traditional smoke processing methods used by First Nations communities can provide value toward producing food products that have extended shelf lives, and protect against a prevalent common pathogen easily transmitted by humans to processed food through direct contact.

AB  - A 1987 Settlement Agreement between Alcan Aluminum Ltd., the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia, established a program (Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program) of ''measures'' to conserve salmon stocks in the Nechako River, Large-scale applications of several habitat measures are planned to offset the risks to chinook salmon caused by reductions in habitat quality associated with reduced flows and mid-summer temperatures. Experimental placement of debris refugia and introduction of inorganic nutrients were conducted from 1988 to 1991 in the upper river. Juvenile chinook salmon highly colonized stream-side debris structures, including rootwad-tree sweepers, floating cribs, pseudo-beaver lodges and debris catchers. Fry density was similar to that in natural woody debris cover, which is sparse in the river. Durability of the structures was low to moderate, except for debris catchers which readily withstood peak flows of 250-270 m(3).s(-1). Debris catchers were also more extensively utilized by young chinook during the rearing and migratory period in June. Mean numbers of chinook fry per structure during May, June and July (1991) were: debris catchers; 277, 522 and 40; debris bundles; 209, 85 and 17, respectively. By 1991 during June to July, most chinook fry counted along the margins of the 20-km study reach, inhabited the added debris structures. Adult rainbow trout also more extensively colonized debris structures than nonstructure sites along the river margins. An in-situ nutrient bioassay in the upper river demonstrated marked nitrogen deficiency and phosphorus co-limitation, with oligotrophic background levels at detection limits. Subsequent whole-river additions of 5-fold increases in inorganic N and P from May to July in 1989 (flow, 52 m(3).s(-1)) indicated that peak periphyton accrual, dominated by diatoms, increased an order of magnitude, and nutrient additions elevated periphyton accrual over large distances (50 km). High emigration of chinook fry confounded detection of a growth response. Debris structure placements were effective as salmonid cover, but it was unconfirmed if fertilization will augment the growth of young chinook in the upper Nechako River, as was confirmed earlier for juvenile coho salmon and steelhead trout at an oligotrophic coastal river.

AB  - ObjectiveTo measure the effectiveness of implementing the chronic care model (CCM) in improving HIV clinical outcomes. DesignMultisite, prospective, interventional cohort study. SettingTwo urban community health centres in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. ParticipantsTwo hundred sixty-nine HIV-positive patients (18 years of age or older) who received primary care at either of the study sites. InterventionSystematic implementation of the CCM during an 18-month period. Main outcome measuresDocumented pneumococcal vaccination, documented syphilis screening, documented tuberculosis screening, antiretroviral treatment (ART) status, ART status with undetectable viral load, CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL, and CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL while not taking ART compared during a 36-month period. ResultsOverall, 35% of participants were women and 59% were aboriginal persons. The mean age was 45 years and most participants had a history of injection drug use that was the presumed route of HIV transmission. During the study follow-up period, 39 people died, and 11 transferred to alternate care providers. Compared with their baseline clinical status, study participants showed statistically significant (P < .001 for all) increases in pneumococcal immunization (54% vs 84%), syphilis screening (56% vs 91%), tuberculosis screening (23% vs 38%), and antiretroviral uptake (47% vs 77%), as well as increased viral load suppression rates among those receiving ART (72% vs 90%). Stable housing at baseline was associated with a 4-fold increased probability of survival. Aboriginal ethnicity was not associated with better or worse outcomes at baseline or at follow-up. ConclusionApplication of the CCM approach to HIV care in a marginalized, largely aboriginal patient population led to improved disease screening, immunization, ART uptake, and virologic suppression rates. In addition to addressing underlying social determinants of health, a paradigm shift away from an “infectious disease” approach to a “chronic disease management” approach to HIV care for marginalized populations is strongly recommended.

AB  - Additions of inorganic N and P to replicated stream mesocosms were used to test the hypothesis that production of the benthic food web in the flow-controlled Nechako River, B.C., was N and P limited. N, P, and N + P additions were contrasted with controls to determine the responses of periphyton and macroinvertebrates over a 33-day period in late spring. Periphyton accrual under N + P addition was greater than two times that of the controls, and N alone produced a moderate increase. Periphyton showed relatively little response to P addition compared with controls. Macroinvertebrates, especially orthocladiine midges and mayflies, increased in density under N or N + P additions, in contrast with P additions and controls. Increased emergence rates of adult aquatic insects from the mesocosms were consistent with increases observed in benthic invertebrates. The results showed nutrient Limitation of benthic productivity and that algal and benthic invertebrate responses were closely coupled. N was most Limiting, but with additions of inorganic N as low as 10 mu g . L-1, P became limiting. The benthic invertebrates that increased most in abundance corresponded to the predominant prey in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry diets at the time of the experiment.

AB  - The addition of 540 MW of hydroelectric generating capacity to the Nechako Reservoir involves the increased diversion of water from the headwaters of the Nechako River in the Fraser River drainage to the Kemano River on the Pacific coast. Approval of the project requires a two level release structure at Kenney Dam at the head of the Nechako Canyon to manage downstream flows and water temperatures to conserve and protect chinook and sockeye populations. Two- and three-dimensional mathematical models were used to evaluate the hydrothermal characteristics of the Nechako Reservoir and to assess the capability of the proposed structure to provide releases necessary to meet downstream objectives. Results of the modelling show that deep water intake temperatures are sensitive to reservoir surface elevation and the deep water intake elevation. Modelling results for maximum release of 200 m3/s show that the deep water intake invert should be located at an elevation of 795 m to ensure water temperature criteria are met. The three dimensional modelling showed that little, if any additional bottom water mixing beyond that indicated by the two dimensional results for a nearby lake is likely to occur as a result of the Kenamo completion project. Extreme condition analysis shows that there exists sufficient volumes of cold water in the Nechako reservoir to ensure that the 10 degree C water release criteria can be met for the required period

AB  - With its entry into Confederation, British Columbia assumed jurisdiction over public lands ("assumed" may have a double meaning given the Supreme Court's 2014 Tsilhqot'in decision) through section 92 (5) of the Constitution Act, while the federal government undertook responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" under section 91 (24). Governmental conduct of Indigenous relations was further guided by Article 13 of the Terms of Union Act, which committed the Dominion to "a policy as liberal as that hitherto pursued" by colonial governments, supported by a concomitant provincial obligation for periodic transfer of public lands to the Dominion in pursuit of that goal.6 Those arrangements quickly brought competing provincial and federal approaches to "the Indian land question" into overt conflict. The Cheslatta and Ingenika bands were both abruptly uprooted from their homes and reserve lands by the Kemano and W.A.C. Bennett dams, respectively.7 Persistence of policy and prejudice during the period was reflected in two core themes: first, that Indigenous interests were subordinate to governmental interests (replacement of reserves lost to flooding was at best an afterthought, a cursory legal obligation to be fulfilled after substantive resource development decisions had been made);8 second, that government knew best what was good for Indigenous people (what the latter needed or wanted was irrelevant or inconsequential). 96 L.E.

AB  - For the past 20 years First Nations leaders of northern British Columbia have been advocating for a Social Work program that would address the unique needs of First Nations communities. This is not surprising given the historical destruction of First Nations families and communities as a result of colonization. Many would argue that current child welfare practices continue on where residential schools left off in implementing government assimilation policies. Approximately 30% of all children in care in Canada are Aboriginal (Fournier and Crey,1998). This is no different in British Columbia. In the northernhalf of the province the number of Aboriginal children in continuing care is as high as 80% (Children's Commission Annual Report, 1998). The need for culturally sensitive child welfare practices is critical to First Nations communities and families. With the opening of a new northern university in 1992, University of Northern British Columbia, there was a renewed hope by northern First Nations leaders for a Social Work program that would meet their needs as well as support their vision for a future of self sufficiency and independence. This paper describes one small step in that vision, that is, the development of First Nations Social Work courses. To better understand this development process it is first important to be aware of the context in which it was undertaken.

AB  - Flooding events can have significant impacts, in terms of both loss of life and property damage. Analyzing floods to understand their processes and patterns improves our ability to predict when floods will occur. Under changing climate conditions, this will become even more important. The utility of an alternative approach to conventional flood analysis was investigated in a regulated river system with a reservoir, the Nechako River Basin located in British Columbia, Canada. Using the 1955–2008 daily discharge measured on the Nechako River discharge and its major tributaries, a random forest model was constructed to evaluate the relative importance of contributing discharges to the main stem during significant flood events in the downstream community of Prince George. Discharges from the unregulated Stellako and Nautley Rivers were found to be the most important variables during a spring flood. Conversely, during a winter flood, the regulated Skins Lake Spillway and the Kemano Powerhouse discharges were found to be the most important variables in the model. During periods of no flood, the main stem Nechako River at Isle Pierre discharge was the most important. This work provides a novel source of evidence that flow regulation on the Nechako River is an important indicator of downstream winter flood conditions in Prince George, potentially exacerbating ice jams and/or causing significant property damage and economic losses.

AB  - Despite recent setbacks, like the Feb. 4 Supreme Court of Canada decision not to get involved in the dispute, [Justa Monk] has vowed to continue his decadelong fight against Alcan's Kemano Completion Project (Kemano 2). Monk's tribal council, based in Prince George, consists of 10 Indian bands, including the Cheslatta Carrier Nation. Monk knows the Cheslatta story well and he also knows the Kemano project poses a real threat to the survival of his people.In 1987 Alcan and the governments of B.C. and Canada reached a secret deal on the Nechako's water. They decided Alcan could have 87 per cent for its Kemano 2 project, while the people along the river and the wildlife, waterfowl and fish could have 13 per cent. The people were shut out of this deal six years ago and they've been shut out every year since, by one secret deal after another. It's time for the secrecy to stop and it's time for the truth about the full impacts of the Kemano projects to come out - before Alcan is allowed to put another spade to the ground. The planned provincial review falls short.To give [Bill Clinton] a better understanding of Kemano 2, Monk sent him a copy of the excellent 25 - page chapter on the Nechako from Mark Hume's book The Run of the River. In it Hume, an award - winning writer, quotes Dr. Don Alderdice, who for years has valiantly expressed his concerns about Kemano 2. Alderdice, a retired salmon physiologist, who worked for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for 49 years, has studied the project in depth. His conclusion: "The Kemano Completion flows are going to be disastrous, absolutely catastrophic."

AB  - Between 1908 and 1912, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway appropriated reserve land possessed by the Lheidli T'enneh Band at Fort George (now Prince George), B.C., offering $68 000, and ultimately paying $125 000, for land it later sold for more than $1 million. Band members were pressured by missionary clergy and the Department of Indian Affairs, to surrender the reserve to the railway swiftly and, from the perspective of the company, cheaply. Resistance by the band to the surrender did, however, result in temporarily stalled negotiations and a marked increase in compensation. The surrender or "sale" of Reserve No. 1 is illustrative of the broader phenomenon of the transfer of aboriginal reserve land to national railways, justified by the perceived benefit of the railway to the progress and development of Canada, and by the alleged benefit of relocation and isolation of the Lheidli T'enneh to their ultimate assimilation into Canadian society.

TI  - Review of water management in the Nechako River Basin : final report
TY  - journalArticle
AU  - Scarge, B. L.
AB  - A comprehensive review of water management practices in the Nechako River Basin in British Columbia was provided. The Nechako Reservoir System is an important component of the Kemano hydroelectric power generation project which is owned by Alcan Smelters and Chemicals Ltd. Particular attention was focused on the events and circumstances that resulted in ice jams and flooding in down-stream communities from the Nechako Reservoir in the fall of 1996, which has become the source of considerable public concern. Reservoir management practices regarding energy production, fisheries resource protection, flood protection and recreational use, were reviewed. The roles and responsibilities of those responsible for reservoir operations were analyzed and the water management of the reservoir during 1996 was assessed. Recommendations were made to help strengthen the reservoir operating practices.

TI  - Remembering forward : navigating the everyday of forced displacement with the Cheslatta T'en
TY  - thesis
AU  - Wikler, Maia
AB  - Development in British Columbia has and continues to operate within an extractivist, colonial framework with little regard to environmental or community impacts. In 1952, the Cheslatta T’En were forcibly removed from their homelands for Alcan’s Kenney Dam. Because of the frequent flooding of Nechako Reservoir, the Cheslatta live in constant tension with a permanently changed landscape as the bones of their ancestors and memories of their way of life continues to wash ashore. The coordinated and intentional efforts of Alcan and the Department of Indian Affairs to remove all material traces of the Cheslatta from their lands had devastating impacts that reach into their ancestral past, continue in the present, and shape Cheslatta’s collective action for a more just future. The Cheslatta’s memories of their lands and forced displacement are the traces that Alcan and the settler state could not erase. Today, with approximately 140 band members resettled onto eleven different reserves, totaling 1,400 hectares and scattered over 170 miles apart, the Cheslatta navigate resettlement and efforts to reclaim their heritage in a land and space disconnected from what had been their homelands for thousands of years. Through an ethnohistorical and ethnographic analysis, I investigate the following: How are acts of resistance to displacement and dispossession informed by cultural meanings and memories of the land? What are the everyday experiences of dispossession and displacement? How do community members navigate “moving forward”? In this thesis, I analyze the individually narrated experiences of displacement; observations of reconciliation negotiations; community gatherings; Cheslatta community members’ interactions with the landscape; and, archival documents. My analysis coincides with theoretical frameworks of memory, space and place, and settler state reconciliation politics.

AB  - Water temperature is actively being monitored along the regulated Nechako River and some of its unregulated tributaries in northern British Columbia (BC) to determine how climate variability, climate change and flow regulation influence water temperatures. The Nechako Watershed, located mainly in the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone, spans 47,200 km2 in area . The regional climate experiences a prominent seasonal cycle in air temperature and precipitation, with subfreezing temperatures and snow accumulating during winter. Waterways therefore experience extended near 0°C water/ice temperatures during the winter season. The accumulation of snow yields snowmelt-generated peaks in discharge during the spring freshet period in unregulated tributaries ., Regional studies on climate reveal recent warming trends that are anticipated to persist through the 21st century, with a projected mean air temperature increase of ∼2°C by the 2050’s . In response to warming air temperatures, regional water temperatures are also on the rise, with an average warming trend of 0.7°C from 1950 to 2015 . Changing water temperatures are important in understanding ecological and environmental impacts on riverine systems, including aquatic species such as fish (e.g., sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), all endemic species to the Nechako Watershed), invertebrates, and micro-organisms. Managing water temperatures during the fish spawning season is crucial as elevated temperatures induce stress and affect reproduction success ., Starting with a pilot project in summer of 2019, we expanded in situ monitoring of water temperature to 29 sites; however, for the purposes of this paper, only data from 24 sites are included (some sites have limited data samples or loggers could not be retrieved in the field). Currently, 25 sites are fully operational and collecting data, all deployed to sample and record data at 15-minute intervals starting at the top of the hour. Site data collection occurs at minimum once annually (typically during summer/early fall), along with site and logger maintenance. Field notes are taken to identify any potential issues with data collection, such as loggers dewatering during low flows, duration of logger removal for data collection, and any other environmental concerns that should later be considered during data analysis., The assembled data are useful to build long-term time series of observed water temperatures within the Nechako Watershed and as a baseline for future projects. The data are also used to determine the effectiveness of the Summer Temperature Management Program at the Nechako Reservoir and Skins Lake Spillway . Therefore, these data can be used in the future to better identify the optimal discharge from the reservoir to minimize ecological effects on the watershed.

AB  - Canfor's Prince George Pulp & Paper Mill in Prince George, BC, Canada operates a bleach plant effluent system for the production of Bleached Kraft Pulp. The original underground fiberglass reinforced pipe (FRP) presents an elevated risk to both environment and production targets. Over the past five years there have been over 10 repairs required to maintain integrity of the pipeline. The primary objective of the project was to create a more reliable pipeline and reduce the risk of a major leak event and subsequent consequences. With temperatures up to 75 degrees C, standard PE4710 materials were not suitable for this application. A brand new Polyethylene of Raised Temperature Resistance (PE-RT) pipe that expands the use of Polyethylene (PE) pipe into larger diameter industrial applications allowing continuous operating range from -45 degrees C to 82 degrees C with intermittent temperatures up to 95 degrees C was selected to replace the underground fiberglass piping.

AB  - The John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) was established as a co-managed forest between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, as an opportunity for these partners to blend their respective ways of understanding and managing forests to contribute to ecological and social sustainability Using four criteria of successful co-management reported in the literature as critical to the early stages of partnership - partnership building, institutional structure, decision-making, and capacity - we discuss the JPRF's performance during the first half-decade of its existence. The JPRF's early experience provides an example of the evolution of a co-management relationship that, while facing constraints and challenges in regard to some of the criteria, has provided the foundation for a strong future partnership.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indigenous leaders and child and family advocates are deeply concerned about the health impacts of the child welfare system, including HIV vulnerability. The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of having been apprehended into the child welfare system and associated HIV vulnerabilities among young Indigenous people who use drugs. METHODS: The Cedar Project is a cohort of young Indigenous people ages 14-30 years who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. Multivariable logistic regression modeling determined associations between a history of involvement in the child welfare system and vulnerability to HIV infection. RESULTS: Of 605 participants, 65% had been taken from their biological parents. Median age of first apprehension was 4 years old. Having been sexually abused, having a parent who attended residential school and being HIV-positive were all independently associated with having been involved in the child welfare system. Participants who had been involved in the child welfare system were also more likely to have been homeless, paid for sex, diagnosed and hospitalized with mental illness, self-harmed, thought about suicide, and attempted suicide. Among participants who used injection drugs, those who had been involved in child welfare were more likely to have shared needles and overdosed. CONCLUSION: This study has found compelling evidence that young Indigenous people who use drugs in two cities in BC are experiencing several distressing health outcomes associated with child welfare involvement, including HIV infection. Jurisdictional reforms and trauma-informed programs that use culture as intervention are urgently needed.

AB  - Two-dimensional (2-D) models of audio and broadband magnetotelluric (MT) data collected throughout the southern Nechako basin in south central British Columbia, Canada, provide electrical resistivity images of the Cretaceous to Oligocene volcanic and sedimentary packages and underlying crustal-scale features. Analysis of distortion effects and structural dimensionality indicate that the MT responses are primarily one-dimensional (1-D) at periods less than 0.1 s. Departures from a 1-D response occur with maximum phase differences occurring between 0.1 and 10 s. The upper crustal resistivity models reveal a low resistivity layer at near surface depths, interpreted as Chilcotin basalts, that blankets portions of the region to depths less than 50 m, but locally thicken up to 200 m. Cretaceous sedimentary units (those showing the highest potential for hydrocarbons) are characterized by moderately low resistivities that are laterally variable. More uniform, lower resistivities appear to be associated with the Eocene volcaniclastic groups, suggesting that the MT method can distinguish between these units and may be useful in targeting areas that are more prospective for hydrocarbon exploration. In general midcrustal resistivity values are high, consistent with values of typical volcanic terranes; however, a low-resistivity zone is identified at 8-10 km depth that correlates closely with the location of seismic reflectors as well as recent microseismic activity. This low-resistivity zone is interpreted as a midcrustal reservoir of magma, the top of which marks the upper limit of fluids migrating from lower crust depths. Additionally, several crustal-scale faults are imaged.

AB  - Introduction: To help address physician shortages in the underserved community of Prince George, Canada, the University of British Columbia (UBC) and various partners created the Northern Medical Program (NMP), a regional distributed site of UBC's medical doctor undergraduate program. Early research on the impacts of the NMP revealed a high degree of social connectedness. The objective of the present study was to explore the role of social capital in supporting the regional training site and the benefits accrued to a broad range of stakeholders and network partners.; Methods: In this qualitative study, 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with community leaders in 2007. A descriptive content analysis based on analytic induction technique was employed. Carpiano's Bourdieu-based framework of 'neighbourhood' social capital was adapted to empirically describe how social capital was produced and mobilized within and among networks during the planning and implementation of the NMP.; Results: Results from this study reveal that the operation of social capital and the related concept of social cohesion are multifaceted, and that benefits extend in many directions, resulting in somewhat unanticipated benefits for other key stakeholders and network partners of this medical education program. Participants described four aspects of social capital: (i) social cohesion; (ii) social capital resources; (iii) access to social capital; and (iv) outcomes of social capital.; Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the partnerships and networks formed in the NMP planning and implementation phases were the foundation for social capital mobilization. The use of Carpiano's spatially-bounded model of social capital was useful in this context because it permitted the characterization of relations and networks of a tight-knit community body. The students, faculty and administrators of the NMP have benefitted greatly from access to the social capital mobilized to make the NMP operational. Taking account of the dynamic and multifaceted operation of social capital helps one move beyond a view of geographic communities as simply containers or sinks of capital investment, and to appreciate the degree to which they may act as a platform for productive network formation and expansion.

AB  - Seismic inversion is applied to generate physical property models (P-wave velocity and numerical attenuation) for four profiles in the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau region of south-central British Columbia, Canada. A newly developed method that combines three-dimensional (3-D) travel-time inversion and 2.5-dimensional (2.5-D) viscoacoustic full-waveform inversion was applied to generate the geophysical models from vibroseis data acquired along the preexisting crooked roads. These models are useful for the characterization of rock types in terms of their positions and thicknesses, which may be used in conjunction with geological ground truth to infer the extent of lithostratigraphic units in the subsurface. The velocity structures also may be used for future reprocessing of the seismic reflection data to derive improved images based on the better near-surface velocity models. The subsurface geology of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau region is complex, resulting from multiple stages of tectonic compression and extension, contemporaneous with the deposition of sediments and volcanic material. Several basin structures are identified from the joint interpretation of the waveform tomography velocity models and post-stack time migration images. The combination of these results enables the extrapolation and characterization of geological structures to similar to 3 km depth, particularly within the Cenozoic volcanic units that dominate near-surface stratigraphy. Based on the seismic profiles, a fence-diagram geological interpretation that extends to similar to 3 km depth illustrates the complex structure of the Jurassic to Neogene stratigraphic sequence.

The objectives of this study were to (a) describe the prevalence of suicide attempt and (b) to describe correlates of vulnerability to suicide attempts within a cohort of young Aboriginal people who use drugs in 2 Canadian cities. We aimed to situate the findings within the context of historical and lifetime trauma. Study design. The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving 605 young Aboriginal people aged 14–30 who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, Canada.Methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling identified independent predictors of suicide attempts. Estimates of adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.Result. In multivariable analysis, residing in Prince George (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.64), ever having been sexually abused (AOR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.39, 3.08), and ever having overdosed (AOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.42) independently predicted lifetime attempted suicide.Conclusions. Suicide prevention and intervention programs must address historical and lifetime trauma among Aboriginal young people who struggle with substance dependence.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) living in the mountainous areas of British Columbia are usually classified as either northern caribou, which spend much of the winter in low-elevation relatively young forests foraging primarily on terrestrial lichens, or mountain caribou, which winter in high-elevation old subalpine forests foraging exclusively on arboreal lichens. The forest-management practices necessary to conserve caribou differ substantially between these two categories of animals with different life-history strategies. Because of this variability in winter-habitat use, information relating specifically to Takla Lake caribou was required for forest management. To provide this information, we radio-collared 15 female caribou in two subherds in the vicinity of Takla Lake and determined their distribution and movements between January 1996 and May 1998 in relation to topography and vegetation cover. Habitat selection was examined using a classified satellite image. At the landscape scale, Takla Lake caribou ..., Les Caribous (Rangifer tarandus) qui vivent dans les zones montagneuses de la Colombie-Britannique sont généralement classifiés comme des caribous « du nord », où les animaux passent une bonne partie de l'hiver à basse altitude, dans des forêts relativement jeunes, se nourrissant surtout de lichens terrestres, ou alors comme des caribous « de montagne », où les animaux passent l'hiver à haute altitude, dans de vielles forêts subalpines, se nourrissant exclu- sivement de lichens arboricoles. Les pratiques de gestion nécessaires à la conservation des caribous varient considérable ment entre ces deux stratégies opposées. À cause de la variabilité dans l'utilisation de l'habitat en hiver et pour des fins de gestion, nous avons eu besoin d'informations concernant spécifiquement les caribous du lac Takla.

AB  - Changes in air temperature and precipitation can modify snowmelt-driven runoff in snowmelt-dominated regimes. This study focuses on climatic change impacts on the snow hydrology of the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Statistically-downscaled forcing datasets based on 12 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to drive the VIC model for two 30-year time periods, a historical baseline (1980-2009) and future projections (2040-2069: 2050s), under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5.The ensemble-based VIC simulations reveal widespread and regionally coherent spatial changes in snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE) and snowcover over the FRB by the 2050s. While the mean precipitation is projected to increase slightly, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is projected to decrease by nearly 50% in the 2050s compared to the baseline. Snow accumulation and snow covered area are projected to decline substantially across the FRB, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. Onset of springtime snowmelt in the 2050s is projected to be nearly 25 days earlier than historically, yielding more runoff in the winter and spring for the Fraser River at Hope, BC and earlier recession to low-flow volumes in summer. The ratio of snowmelt contribution to runoff decreases by nearly 20% in the Stuart and Nautley sub-basins of the FRB in the 2050s. The decrease in SWE and loss of snowcover is greater in low-to-mid, than high, elevations where temperature remain sufficiently cold for precipitation to fall as snow.

AB  - Across the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of British Columbia, the distribution of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, which are considered prospective for hydrocarbon exploration, is poorly known due to the surface cover of glacial deposits and Tertiary volcanic rocks. To constrain the subsurface distribution of these Cretaceous rocks, in 2008 Geoscience BC acquired seven long, up to 14.4 km, offset vibroseis seismic reflection lines across a north-northwest-trending belt of exhumed sedimentary rocks inferred to be part of the Taylor Creek Group. P-wave velocity models, which are consistent with sonic logs from nearby wells, have been estimated using three-dimensional first-arrival tomography to depths ranging from 1 to 4 km. Igneous basement can be identified on most lines using the 5.5 km/s isovelocity contour, which locates the top of the basement to an accuracy of similar to 400 m where its depth is known in exploration wells. There is no general distinction on the basis of seismic velocity between Cretaceous sedimentary and Paleocene-Eocene volcanic-volcaniclastic rocks, both of which appear to be characterized in the tomographic models by velocities of 3.0-5.0 km/s. The geometry of the igneous basement inferred from the velocity models identifies north-trending basins and ridges, which correlate with exposed rocks of the Jurassic Hazelton Group. Identified Cretaceous sedimentary rocks occur beneath less negative Bouguer gravity anomalies, but the original distribution of these rocks has been disrupted by later Tertiary extension that created north-trending basins associated with the most negative gravity anomalies. We suggest that Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, if deposited, could be preserved within these basins if the rocks had not been eroded prior to Tertiary extension.

AB  - In the BATHOLITHSonland seismic project, a refraction wide-angle reflection survey was shot in 2009 across the Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau of central British Columbia. Part of the seismic profile crossed the Nechako Basin, a Jurassic-Cretaceous basin with potential for hydrocarbons within sedimentary strata that underlies widespread volcanic rocks. Along this 205 km-long line segment, eight large explosive shots were fired into 980 seismometers. Forward and inverse modelling of the traveltime data were conducted with two independent methods: ray-tracing based modelling of first and secondary arrivals, and a higher resolution wavefront-based first-arrival seismic tomography. Material with velocities less than 5.0 km/s is interpreted as sedimentary rocks of the Nechako Basin, while velocities from 5.0-6.0 km/s may correspond to interlayered sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The greatest thickness of sedimentary rocks in the basin is found in the central 110 km of the profile. Two sub-basins were identified in this region, with widths of 20-50 km and maximum sedimentary depths of 2.5 and 3.3 km. Such features are well-defined in the velocity model, since resolution tests indicate that features with widths greater than similar to 13 km are reliable. Beneath the sedimentary rocks, seismic velocities increase more slowly with depth - from 6.0 km/s just below the basin to 6.3 km/s at similar to 17 km in depth, and then to 6.8-7.0 km/s at the base of the crust. The Moho is found at a depth of 33.5-35 km beneath the profile, and mantle velocities are high at 8.05-8.10 km/s.

AB  - We used electromyogram (EMG) radiotelemetry to assess swimming activity (e.g., swim speeds), behaviour, and migration speeds (e.g., ground speeds) of individual adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrating through several reaches of the Fraser and Nechako rivers in British Columbia. Using a laboratory swim flume and volitionally swimming adult fish carrying EMG transmitters, we developed relationships between EMG pulse intervals and swim speeds. A bioenergetics model was used to estimate reach-specific energy use per metre for each individual based on the average swim speed, migration time, body size, and river temperature. Migration was most energetically efficient (i.e., migration costs per unit distance traveled were relatively low) for females compared with males, large males compared with small males, and 1995 males compared with 1993 males. In all three cases, differences in swim speed patterns were primarily responsible for differences in energy use.

Nous avons fait nager librement des poissons adultes portant des émetteurs EMG dans un rapide de laboratoire pour établir une relation entre, d'une part, les intervalles entre impulsions et, d'autre part, les vitesses de nage. Nous avons utilisé un modèle bioénergétique pour estimer l'utilisation d'énergie par mètre dans les différents tronçons des cours d'eau pour chaque individu à partir de la vitesse de nage moyenne, du temps de migration, de la taille des individus et de la température de l'eau. L'efficacité énergétique de la migration était plus grande (c'est-à-dire que les coûts de la migration par unité de distance franchie était relativement faibles) chez les femelles que che...

AB  - We report on the identity, characterization, and spatial trends of several brominated flame retardants and hydroxylated (OH-) and methoxylated (MeO-) organohalogen contaminants in bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nestling plasma collected from sites along the west coast of North America. Samples were from four southwestern British Columbia (BC) locations, a reference site in northern BC (Fort St. James; FSJ), and from Santa Catalina Island, CA (SCI), an area of high DDT and PCB contamination. Mean concentrations of Σpolybrominated diphenyl ether (ΣPBDE (8 congeners monitored); 1.78−8.49 ng/g), ΣOH-polychlorinated biphenyl (ΣOH-PCB (30 congeners monitored); 0.44−0.87 ng/g), and ΣOH-PBDE (14 congeners monitored; 0.31−0.92 ng/g) were similar in eaglets from southwestern BC yet lower than for SCI and significantly higher than for FSJ. Dominant PBDE congeners were BDE47, BDE99, and BDE100, but SCI eaglets also contained low levels of higher brominated congeners. 4-OH-CB187 and 4‘-OH-CB202 accounted for 65−100% of ΣOH-PCB in all BC eaglets, with 4‘-OH-CB202 as well as 3‘-OH-CB138 and 4-OH-CB146 dominating in SCI eaglets. Ostensibly of biogenic origin, 6‘-OH-BDE49 and 6-OH-BDE47 were found in BC nestlings. Only 4‘-OH-BDE49 (2.10 ng/g) was found in SCI eaglets. MeO-PBDEs and total hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were not found in any birds, but the polybrominated biphenyl BB101 was detected in southwestern BC samples. This study demonstrates that west coast North American bald eagles contain previously unreported organohalogens, which have the potential to impact the health and survival of these raptors.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Magnetically tagged particles were used to investigate the effects of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and floods on the dispersion of coarse bed material in the Stuart-Takla region, British Columbia, Canada. The dominant annual sediment transporting event in the channels is the snowmelt flood events, with lesser activity usually accomplished during summer floods. Annually in August, the channel bed material is reworked by the Early Stuart sockeye salmon spawning, as the fish excavate the streambed to deposit and bury their eggs. These nesting cavities are called redds. Results from 67 tracer recovery experiments over five years were highly variable, subject to the magnitude of floods and the returning population of salmon. Overall, the depositional pattern from nival flood events usually demonstrated a high degree of clast mobilization, long travel distances (up to 150 m), and mean depths of burial up to 18 cm. Summer flood events showed somewhat lower rates of mobilization, distances of travel, and depths of burial. Although the fish did not move the tracers very far, their effect on the bed was generally quite pervasive - up to 100 percent of the clasts were mobilized, and the depth of burial was considerable (mean burial depths up to 14 cm). The amount of vertical mixing of sediment by salmon was often on the same order of magnitude as flood events. The significant vertical mixing of sediments by the fish has important implications for the mobility of sediment in the stream. Since any armoring layer formed during high flows throughout the year is subject to the bioturbation of salmon, this suggests that the transport threshold in the creeks remains relatively low. Salmon likely play an integral role in the sediment transport dynamics and annual sediment budget of the lower reaches of these creeks.

AB  - Sediment dynamics in most large river basins are influenced by a variety of different natural and anthropogenic pressures, and disentangling these cumulative effects remains a challenge. This study determined the contemporary and historical sources of fine-grained (< 63-μm) sediment in a large, regulated river basin and linked changes in sources to activities in the basin. The river has seen declines in chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, and the endangered Nechako white sturgeon populations, and sediment (both fine-grained and sands) transport and deposition have been identified as potential causes of these declines.

AB  - While researching aspects of indigenous oral history in the western part of what is currently called Canada, I encountered an anecdote from a Southern Tutchone elder from the Yukon. This elder, Mrs. Annie Ned, was criticizing a group of scientists at a joint conference of scientists and indigenous persons involved in environmental issues facing the polar and sub-polar regions of Canada. She said to the scientists: 'You people talk from paper' (Cruikshank 1998: 45). In this essay I will discuss why and how this phrase functions as potent criticism of how western law and science deal with indigenous groups in settler colonial societies and, perhaps, how western law and science deal with knowledge in general. To do that I'll look at a case where two different kinds of legal tradition come into conflict-in part because of what each of them takes to be law's materials. The case is called Delgamuukw v. British Columbia (hereinafter Delgamuukw). The conflict is between Canada and two indigenous groups-the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en- residing in what is currently called British Columbia.

As much as e-health technologies are valuable and empowering an interventionist presumption limits the potential value of digital communication as a healing resource. With examples from three digital story-telling sites, we explore the internet as both a social space and therapeutic tool where indigenous youth are constructing and negotiating Aboriginality through online story sharing. Those digital stories, like other narrative forms, are part of a larger complex of contemporary forms of healing.

AB  - Whatever his motives, Wright in 1863 had boiler, machinery and fittings for the sternwheeler Enterprise packed by mules from Port Douglas at the head of Harrison Lake over the portages to Lillooet and up the wagon road to a point near Fort Alexandria upstream from Soda Creek. Victoria's skilled shipbuilder James Trahey was brought north to superintend construction, and steam was raised on 9 May. From 1863 to 1869 the Enterprise worked diligently and profitably throughout a long season on the Upper Fraser Route, but in the latter year she looked to be facing retirement when Wright replaced her with the larger, more powerful sternwheeler Victoria . The Omineca gold rush and Wright's questing nature however reprieved her from oblivion. Well aware of the transportation economies offered by steamboating, Wright determined to send the Enterprise with a supply of goods on a voyage of discovery to see if the Omineca country could be served by a water route. In 1871 she was taken through the Cottonwood and Fort George Canyons to Fort George, then up the Nechako to the Stuart River, up the Stuart to Stuart Lake, up Tachie River to Trembleur Lake, and then up Middle River and Takla Lake to Takla Landing, a feat never equalled in river navigation in British Columbia. Had the Omineca boom been more sustained, who knows what might have taken place in the way of steamboat development.

AB  - Small tenures diversify British Columbia?s forest tenure system and create new opportunities for local involvement in forest management. Held by local people and organizations, small tenures generate expectations that forest management will reflect a broad range of community values for forest use. Woodlot Licences and Community Forest Agreements (CFAs) are small, area-based, long-term licences that grant exclusive rights to manage and harvest timber on public land. Community Forest Agreements also include limited rights to botanical non-timber forest products. All tenures, whether large or small, carry rules established by the provincial forestry legislative and regulatory framework. Award and renewal of cfas is conditional upon demonstrating community support and receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range. Small tenures are growing in popularity, but account for only a tiny fraction of the provincial forest land base and allowable annual cut. Despite their size, there are big expectations that woodlots and community forests will introduce new ways of managing forests in British Columbia.

AB  - This article traces three years of progress related to building Aboriginal health research capacity with Aboriginal people, communities, and postsecondary institutions through the efforts of the BC Aboriginal Capacity and Developmental Research Environment (ACADRE) network. Extensive Aboriginal community consultations throughout BC resulted in the identification of seven community-determined research theme priorities: traditional healing, knowledge, and practices; addictions and mental health-treatment and transitions; health care programs and policy; health promotion and best practices; Elders' well-being; ethics-research and practice; and capacity-building in and access to research. Various research partnerships with Aboriginal community, health, and educational organizations resulted in the development of research awareness workshops, pilot studies, provincial forums to share research experiences, learning research modules, and the development of community-specific ethical protocols. A significant outcome of the BC ACADRE has been funding and mentoring support for numerous high school, undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students engaged in Aboriginal health education and research.

AB  - The Drunken Indian stereotype has a long history of expression across literary, scientific, sociological, and political discourses. This article traces the persistence and operative nature of its production and reproduction and argues that Eden Robinson's Monkey Beach challenges the stereotype through refiguring addiction as social suffering rather than individual — and racialized — pathology. By employing cartographic imagery, generational juxtaposition, and a first-person dual point of view that negotiates between spectral and spiritless worlds, Monkey Beach contextualizes habitual drinking as a response to alienation from cultural practices that are becoming increasingly threatened by ongoing colonial and capitalist policies of individualism and acculturation. The Haisla characters contend with the affective consequences of living in what Karl Marx calls a “coerced” and “forced labor” economy. Yet, because the forced transition to this mode of production is a relatively recent process within Indigenous histories — one that is violently and insidiously imposed, rather than always already installed — it has not become fully naturalized. Consequently, Robinson depicts addiction as engendered not only by historical trauma emergent from the dismantling of Indigenous lifeways connecting kinship, land, and spirituality, but also by the ideological and material conditions of capital. Ultimately, Robinson's novel betrays how the material conditions of late capitalism exacerbate colonial trauma, which manifests as social suffering, and extend colonialism’s acculturative shadow. As such, Monkey Beach re-signifies addiction as exposing the limits of full participation in a colonial and capitalist economy, precisely because of the cultural, economic, and spiritual violence on which such systems are predicated.

AB  - Studies on the naming and classification of plants by First Peoples of British Columbia began with the works of early ethnographers like Franz Boas. In the 1970s, however, research in this area became more focused in BC, following general trends in ethnobiology and cognitive anthropology in documenting systems of biological “folk taxonomy” in different cultures and languages worldwide. This research reflects collaboration with ethnobotanists, linguists and Indigenous speakers and knowledge holders of First Nations’ languages, and includes recording the names and conceptual relationships of plant species and other plant categories. Identification of factors influencing plant nomenclature and shaping plant classification systems, and how these systems have changed over time and vary from language to language, has been a focus of the research. Most BC First Nations languages incorporate names for between about 120 and 150 different species or basic “generic rank” categories of plants. These tend to be arranged in a shallow hierarchy within a small number of higher order plant categories, such as for “tree,” “bush,” “grass.” In some culturally important species, more detailed sub-categories, within the “generic” taxa, are distinguished with more specific names. The indigenous categories for plants reflected in BC Indigenous languages and cognitive systems reflect culturally important plants, most of which are highly visible and widespread.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle epidemic is changing British Columbia forests and watersheds at the landscape scale. Watersheds with dead-pine-leading stands in the Vanderhoof Forest District of central British Columbia are reported to have wet soils due to raised water tables. They report a conversion of summer logging ground (dry firm soil) to winter logging ground (wetter less firm soil), upon which forestry equipment operation is difficult or impossible before freeze-up. This paper outlines a project that explores this serious operational issue through the perspective of the hydrologic water balance. It aims to determine the spatial extent of wet ground areas and to provide operational guidance through the development of a model that can predict where wet ground may occur at the stand and watershed level. The watershed-level prediction described here will be based on risk indicators developed from available geographic information system data and aerial photographs, as well as local knowledge. Predictions will be qualified through field verification studies at representative stands within ranked watersheds. Preliminary results are presented.

AB  - This preliminary study examined the impact of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation and subsequent canopy mortality on ground snow accumulation and ablation in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands. During the winter of 2005–2006, meteorological and snow conditions were measured in three stands—dead, alive, and cleared—in Northern Interior British Columbia. Variations in measured snow conditions and meteorological data between stands were assessed. Data were used in an energy-balance model to calculate snow ablation in each stand and estimate effects on meltwater production. Results showed that the dead stand no longer behaved like an alive stand, but had not yet approached cleared stand conditions. Ablation rates in the dead stand remained similar to those in the alive stand, although accumulation was closer to that in the cleared stand. The combination of a low ablation rate and increased ground snow accumulation in the dead stand resulted in a lengthened period of snowpack disappearance. In the cleared stand, however, high ablation rates were sufficient to remove the thicker snowpack earlier than in the dead stand. A multi-year study is under way at a new research site to further quantify the relationship between beetle-kill and its effect on snowpack.

AB  - In anticipation of climate change, the community of Prince George, BC has taken steps towards adaptation of community infrastructure. An introductory summary of impacts on temperature, precipitation and streamflow was prepared by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) and presented at several workshops. From the workshops the implications of these changes were identified with feedback from senior city staff and planners and documented in a report, Climate Change in Prince George: Summary of Past Trends and Future Projections and will form the basis of the report Adapting to Climate Change in Prince George. Prince George is a city of roughly 77,000 inhabitants, built on a flood plain at the confluence of the Nechako and Upper Fraser rivers. During the winter of 2007-2008, Prince George experienced severe ice-related flooding when lands along the lower Nechako River were inundated causing extensive damage. The watersheds surrounding Prince George encompass the headwaters of the largest river in BC (the Fraser) and have been heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle. These factors make this region susceptible to climate change impacts, and maintaining water security in this region is a concern to both the residents of Prince George and the Province. Over the last century the city experienced an average warming trend of 1.3°C. In recent decades, Prince George has become warmer in the winter season and a greater percentage of precipitation has fallen as rain rather than snow. Future climate projections were used with an evaluation of uncertainty to allow planners, managers and engineers to better integrate this information and make informed decisions as they prepare to adapt. Annual temperatures in the region are projected to increase by an average of 1.6°C to 2.5°C overthe next 50 years. Precipitation during this time is projected to increase by 3% to 10%, with increases occurring primarily in winter and decreases possibly occurring in summer. These precipitation andtemperature changes will result in changes to streamflow timing and amount that depend on watershed location and type. PCIC partnered with a local resident and expert in adaptation to synthesize these findings and place them in the context of vulnerabilities particular to their community. PCIC has undertaken several similar assessments and has established that an integral part of the procedure is identifying a local champion who leads the effort of defining community needs and ensuring that the report addresses these issues. The championfacilitates a two-way knowledge transfer that is the first step in the complex and difficult process of engaging stakeholders with diverse needs and conflicting demands for limited water resources. Manyorganizations and user groups such as Rio Tinto Alcan, who regulate flow on the Nechako River, have a stake in water resource management in this north-central region of the Province.

AB  - Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) is known to be an effective technique to find the optimal operating policy of hydropower systems. Inorder to improve the performance of SDP, this project evaluates theimpact of re-updating the policy at every time step by using EnsembleStreamflow Prediction (ESP). We present a case study of the Kemano'shydropower system on the Nechako River in British Columbia, Canada.Managed by Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA), this system is subject to largestreamflow volumes in spring due to important amount of snow depthduring the winter season. Therefore, the operating policy should notonly maximize production but also minimize the risk of flooding. Thehydrological behavior of the system is simulated with CEQUEAU, adistributed and deterministic hydrological model developed by theInstitut national de la recherche scientifique - Eau, Terre etEnvironnement (INRS-ETE) in Quebec, Canada. On each decision time step,CEQUEAU is used to generate ESP scenarios based on historicalmeteorological sequences and the current state of the hydrologicalmodel. These scenarios are used into the SDP to optimize the new releasepolicy for the next time steps. This routine is then repeated over theentire simulation period. Results are compared with those obtained byusing SDP on historical inflow scenarios.

AB  - Abstract: For generations, promoters of northern political and economic development have emphasized the importance of post-secondary education. These northern advocates have lamented the absence or narrow scope of post-secondary institutions in the North. Canada is the only Circumpolar Nation without an Arctic university, and there is ample evidence that the region and the country are much the poorer for the lack of northern research, education and training capacity. It is not that Canadian institutions have ignored the region. Northern tier community colleges have played key and innovative roles in responding to regional needs. Southern universities have, through a variety of undergraduate, graduate and professional outreach programs, provided some degree options in the North. The University of the Arctic represents an innovative circumpolar effort to address northern needs across the Circumpolar North. Focusing on the University of Northern British Columbia, which opened in 1994, this paper demonstrates how responsive, regionally-aware post-secondary institutions can have transformative effects on their host communities and regions, and deals with some of the controversies surrounding the opening of the university.

AB  - Canadian utilities continue to turn to hydro as an economical, reliable, renewable resource that can meet their customer's electricity needs. In 1992, construction and planning advanced on nine large hydro projects having the potential for adding nearly 12,000 MW to Canada's installed hydro capacity. New project activities span the country-from the Kemano Completion Project in British Columbia on the West Coast, to activity in Quebec's James Bay in the East, and in between Manitoba and Ontario. And while non-utility generators have taken center stage in the small hydro arena, Canada's provincially owned utilities are largely responsible for this large project development.

AB  - BackgroundWe sought to estimate the prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Aboriginal young people who use drugs and to identify risk factors associated with HCV infection in this population. MethodsThe Cedar Project is a longitudinal study involving Aboriginal young people living in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. Eligibility criteria include age from 14 to 30 years and self-reported use (smoking or injection) of illicit drugs (e.g., crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, heroin or other opiates, and cocaine) at least once in the month before enrolment. At each visit, participants completed a detailed questionnaire administered by an Aboriginal interviewer. For this analysis, we included information for 512 participants who were recruited between September 2003 and April 2005. ResultsAmong the 512 participants, the prevalence of HCV infection was 34.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.6%–38.9%); the rates were similar in Prince George and Vancouver (34.5% and 35.0% respectively, p = 0.37). Among those who reported the use of injection drugs at baseline (n = 286), the prevalence of HCV infection was 59.4% (95% CI 53.8%–65.1%); the rate in this group was slightly higher in Prince George than in Vancouver (62.4% v. 57.1% respectively, p = 0.37). The prevalence was 3.5% among participants who reported smoking drugs (n = 226). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with HCV infection among participants who used injection drugs included daily injection of opiates (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.0–7.4), reuse of syringes (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.4), having at least 1 parent who attended residential school (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.4), female sex (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.4) and duration of injection drug use (per year) (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.5). The crude incidence rate of HCV infection was 10.6% and the incidence density estimate was 9.9 per 100 person-years in this cohort. InterpretationThe prevalence of HCV infection was elevated among Aboriginal young people living in Prince George and Vancouver who use drugs. Culturally based prevention, treatment and harm-reduction programs are urgently needed in this population.

AB  - A systems analysis approach is being used to co-manage the 13,000-hectare John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in Central British Columbia. The JPRF is a working forest managed by the University of Northern British Columbia and Tl'azt'en Nation for the purposes of research, education, and training. Local criteria and indicators of social and ecological sustainability have been identified using a combination of social science and conventional forest management planning techniques. A scenario planning approach is used to facilitate the broad exploration of management alternatives. An analytical decision support tool has been employed to incorporate socio-economic, ecological and operational indicators into an integrated long-term management strategy for the forest. Initial results are presented, and approaches to implementation and monitoring are discussed.

AB  - Early Tertiary lavas and sediments were collected from two areas west and south of Prince George, British Columbia, and processed for K/Ar dating and palynoassemblages.Samples from Cheslatta Falls gave K/Ar dates of 36.5 and 37.7 Ma and yielded a palynoassemblage very similar to that from the Jackson Group in Alabama and Mississippi. This Late Eocene assemblage is interpreted as having developed in a humid subtropical environment, prior to a climatic cooling that, we believe, should be assigned to Early Oligocene time.The Tertiary lavas and sediments from the Nazko area, west of Quesnel, gave three Middle Eocene dates and over 60 species of palynomorphs. These correlate with other rocks and palynoassemblages of Kamloops Group equivalents that occur southward across the International Boundary and north to latitude 55°N. The paleoclimate was wet and in the range of very warm temperate to humid subtropical., Des échantillons de laves et de sédiments du Tertiaire précoce ont été recueillis dans deux régions localisées à l'ouest et au sud de Prince George, en Colombie-Britannique, pour être datés par K/Ar et pour l'étude des palynoassemblages.Les échantillons de Cheslatta Falls donnent des âges K/Ar de 36,5 et 37,7 Ma, et leur palynoassemblage ressemble de très près à celui du Groupe de Jackson présent en Alabama et au Mississippi. Cet assemblage éocène tardif s'est vraisemblablement développé en milieu subtropical, avant le refroidissement climatique qui, d'après nous, est apparu au temps de l'Oligocène précoce.Les laves et les sédiments tertiaires de la région de Nazko, à l'ouest de Quesnel, fournissent trois âges correspondant à l'Éocène moyen et plus de 60 espèces de palynomorphes. Ces résultats établissent la corrélation avec les autres roches et palynoassemblages équivalents du Groupe de Kamloops trouvés vers le sud à travers la frontière Internationnale et au nord de la latitude 55°N.

AB  - The potential of data assimilation for hydrologic predictions has been demonstrated in many research studies. Watersheds over which multiple observation types are available can potentially further benefit from data assimilation by having multiple updated states from which hydrologic predictions can be generated. However, the magnitude and time span of the impact of the assimilation of an observation varies according not only to its type, but also to the variables included in the state vector. This study examines the impact of multivariate synthetic data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the spatially distributed hydrologic model CEQUEAU for the mountainous Nechako River located in British Columbia, Canada. Synthetic data include daily snow cover area (SCA), daily measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) at three different locations and daily streamflow data at the watershed outlet. Results show a large variability of the continuous rank probability skill score over a wide range of prediction horizons (days to weeks) depending on the state vector configuration and the type of observations assimilated. Overall, the variables most closely linearly linked to the observations are the ones worth considering adding to the state vector due to the limitations imposed by the EnKF. The performance of the assimilation of basin-wide SCA, which does not have a decent proxy among potential state variables, does not surpass the open loop for any of the simulated variables. However, the assimilation of streamflow offers major improvements steadily throughout the year, but mainly over the short-term (up to 5 days) forecast horizons, while the impact of the assimilation of SWE gains more importance during the snowmelt period over the mid-term (up to 50 days) forecast horizon compared with open loop. The combined assimilation of streamflow and SWE performs better than their individual counterparts, offering improvements over all forecast horizons considered and throughout the whole year, including the critical period of snowmelt. This highlights the potential benefit of using multivariate data assimilation for streamflow predictions in snow-dominated regions.

AB  - Recent work demonstrated the value of water temperature forecasts to improve water resources allocation and highlighted the importance of quantifying their uncertainty adequately. In this study, we perform a multisite cascading ensemble assimilation of discharge and water temperature on the Nechako River (Canada) using particle filters. Hydrological and thermal initial conditions were provided to a rainfall-runoff model, coupled to a thermal module, using ensemble meteorological forecasts as inputs to produce 5day ensemble thermal forecasts. Results show good performances of the particle filters with improvements of the accuracy of initial conditions by more than 65% compared to simulations without data assimilation for both the hydrological and the thermal component. All thermal forecasts returned continuous ranked probability scores under 0.8°C when using a set of 40 initial conditions and meteorological forecasts comprising 20 members. A greater contribution of the initial conditions to the total uncertainty of the system for 1-dayforecasts is observed (mean ensemble spread=1.1°C) compared to meteorological forcings (mean ensemble spread=0.6°C). The inclusion of meteorological uncertainty is critical to maintain reliable forecasts and proper ensemble spread for lead times of 2days and more. This work demonstrates the ability of the particle filters to properly update the initial conditions of a coupled hydrological and thermal model and offers insights regarding the contribution of two major sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in thermal forecasts.

AB  - This study examines the 1914–2015 runoff trends and variability for 136 rivers draining British Columbia's Coast and Insular Mountains. Rivers are partitioned into eastward and westward flowing rivers based on flow direction from the Coast Mountains. Thus, eastward and westward runoff trends and influence of topography on runoff are explored. Our findings indicate that rivers flowing eastward to the Nechako and Chilcotin plateaus contribute the lowest annual runoff compared to westward rivers where runoff is high. Low interannual runoff variability is evident in westward rivers and their alpine watersheds, whereas eastward rivers exhibit high interannual runoff variability. On Vancouver Island, some of the rivers with the highest annual runoff exhibit high interannual variability. A significant (p < .05) negative correlation exists between mean annual runoff (Rm) and latitude, gauged area, mean elevation, and its corresponding coefficient of variation. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the glacierized area of mountainous regions and Rm. The mean coefficient of variation in annual runoff is significantly negatively correlated with latitude and glacierized area, but significantly positively correlated with longitude. Annual and seasonal runoff trend analyses of each river were performed for an early (1936–2015), a middle (1966–2015), and a late (1986–2015) period using the Mann–Kendall test. Trend analyses revealed a shift towards more positive detectable (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) trends in annual and seasonal runoff from the middle to the late period across the study domain. Most positive detectable seasonal runoff trends in the middle period occur in spring in glacierized westward rivers located >1,200 m, whereas in the late period, they all occur in fall and are regionally coherent around Vancouver Island and south coastal BC. Rivers draining eastward exhibit more positive trends over 1986–2015 compared to westward rivers. This study provides crucial information on the hydrology of mountain watersheds across British Columbia's coast in response to Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase changes, the elevational amplification of regional climate change, and their influences on precipitation and glacier retreat.

AB  - The heart of the traditional legal order of the Lake Babine Nation of north-central British Columbia is the grand ceremonial feast known as the balhats, or potlatch. Misunderstood and widely condemned as a wasteful display of pride, the balhats ceremonies were outlawed by the Canadian government in the late nineteenth century. Throughout the years that followed, the Lake Babine Nation struggled to adapt their laws to a changing society while maintaining their cultural identity. Although the widespread feasting and exchange practices of the balhats have attracted continuous academic and political interest since the nineteenth century, little consideration has been given to understanding the legal practices embedded within the ceremonies. Cis dideen kat, the only book ever written about the Lake Babine Nation, describes the customary legal practices that constitute "the way." Authors Jo-Anne Fiske and Betty Patrick use historical and contemporary data to create a background against which the changing relations between the Lake Babine Nation and the Canadian state are displayed and defined, leading to the current era of treaty negotiations and Aboriginal self-government. Through interviews with community chiefs and elders, oral histories, focus groups, and archival research, Fiske and Patrick have documented and defined a traditional legal system still very much misunderstood. Their findings include material not previously published, making this book essential reading for those involved in treaty negotiations as well as for those with an interest in Aboriginal and state relations generally.

AU  - Teitelbaum, Sara
SN  - 978-0-7748-3191-8
AB  - In recent decades, community forestry has taken root across Canada. Locally run initiatives are lauded as welcome alternatives to large corporate and industrial logging practices, yet little research has been done to document their tangible outcomes or draw connections between their ideals of local control, community benefit, ecological stewardship, and economic diversification and the realities of community forestry practice. This book brings together the work of over twenty-five researchers to provide the first comparative and empirically rich portrait of community forestry policy and practice in Canada. Tackling all of the forestry regions from Newfoundland to British Columbia, it unearths the history of community forestry, revealing surprising regional differences linked to patterns of policy-making and cultural traditions. Case studies celebrate innovative practices in governance and ecological management while uncovering challenges related to government support and market access. The future of the sector is also considered, including the role of institutional reform, multiscale networks, and adaptive management strategies.

AB  - Abstract Over 14 million hectares of lodgepole pine-dominated forests in British Columbia (BC), Canada, have been severely impacted by the current mountain pine beetle epidemic. Simultaneously, a Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in northwest BC has been responsible for killing thousands of hectares of pine plantations and has even resulted in the death of mature trees, which is unprecedented. Both of these globally significant forest pest epidemics have been linked to climate change. The beetle epidemic has grossly exceeded the scale of all previously recorded outbreaks, in large part due to a lack of cold winters. In this sense, the link to global warming is relatively straightforward and foreseeable. Of all climate change projections, the prediction of an increase in winter temperatures has been associated with as high a degree of confidence as any. The Dothistroma needle blight epidemic and its link to climate change were not so predictable. Based on weather records over the past four decades, short-term increases in mean summer precipitation correlate closely with historical records of Dothistroma outbreaks in the northwest. The current most severe outbreak has occurred during a prolonged period of above-average summer precipitation. An increase in summer precipitation would more typically be thought of as beneficial for forests, but that increase in moisture has improved the conditions for a pathogen that has outweighed any benefits. Similar trends of increasing incidence and severity for other forest pathogens in BC appear in areas that have been receiving increased summer precipitation. Conversely, in the southern interior of the province decreased summer precipitation and increased drought conditions are resulting in stressed trees which can favour root diseases. Early indications are that climate change will have profound effects on forest health. Some effects will be more predictable than others.

AB  - BackgroundInappropriate allergy labelling is associated with significant clinical and pharmacoeconomic implications. Detailed antimicrobial allergy assessments represent a key component of antimicrobial stewardship and aid in identifying true type I (immediate hypersensitivity) reactions. The allergy history form currently used at the University Hospital of Northern British Columbia (UHNBC), in Prince George, relies on the assessor’s ability to ask appropriate prompting questions to obtain a thorough history, but it may not be sufficient to accurately identify true allergies. ObjectiveTo compare a standardized allergy history questionnaire and the current allergy history form in terms of the quality and quantity of documentation gathered. MethodsThis prospective observational study involved patients who were admitted to medical and surgical services at UHNBC from November 2018 to January 2019 with a penicillin-class allergy reported on their electronic medical record (EMR). A list of patients with EMR-reported allergies was generated by the hospital’s health information software system, and these patients were interviewed using the standardized allergy history questionnaire. ResultsA total of 48 patients were assessed during the study period. Nineteen (40%) of the patients had an inappropriate allergy label on their EMR. Only 36 (75%) had an allergic reaction described on their EMR. Furthermore, only 36 (75%) of the 48 patients had the same allergy recorded on the EMR and on the allergy history form contained in their paper chart, of whom 22 had a documented reaction. The mean time to complete the standardized allergy history questionnaire was 2 minutes. ConclusionsAt the study institution, documentation of allergy histories was often incomplete. Detailed allergy assessments are the first step in identifying true immunoglobulin E–mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Utilization of a standardized allergy history questionnaire is feasible and may serve to improve documentation and overall antimicrobial stewardship.

AB  - Seasonal changes in crime have been documented since the mid-1800s, but no definitive consensus has been reached regarding universal annual patterns. Researchers also tend to focus on a single city over a particular time period, and, due to methodological differences, studies can often be difficult to compare. As such, this study investigates the seasonal fluctuations of crime across eight cities in British Columbia, Canada, between 2000 and 2006. Uniform Crime Report data, representing four crime types (assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and break and enter) were used in negative binomial or Poisson count models and regressed against trend, weather, and illumination variables. Results suggest that temperature changes impacted assault levels, few weather variables affected the occurrence of robberies, and fluctuations in property crime types were variable across the cities. Moreover, rain and snow had a deterrent effect on crime in cities that were not used to such weather conditions. These findings i...

AB  - Prologue Five years ago we heard three anecdotes about the small town of Burns Lake in northern British Columbia that whetted our phronetic research appetite, as well as our evolving interest in film as a mode of inquiry and a way of approaching collaborative and transformational planning. This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006.

AB  - This study examines the politics of Aboriginal title in British Columbia in the context of the approval process for the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal. We highlight presentations made by First Nations representatives and individuals during the Community Hearings for Oral Evidence stage of the Joint Review Panel, as well as the political actions of First Nations governments, organizations, and individuals outside the hearings. Speakers from several different nations articulated common points with regard to territory, property, and place in support of a case for sovereignty. Building from Aboriginal political theory, we argue that the evidence supports a reading of Aboriginal positions on the pipeline as a politics of refusal, the starting point of which lies within Aboriginal knowledge and governance systems, and not mere reaction to the development proposal. We hope to see more critical geographies of natural resource development incorporate Aboriginal theory into their frameworks. La politique du refus : la souveraineté autochtone et l'oléoduc Northern Gateway Cette étude s'intéresse aux questions politiques portant sur les droits territoriaux des Autochtones en Colombie-Britannique qui émergent du processus d'approbation du projet d'oléoduc Northern Gateway. Nous proposons un survol des différents exposés des représentants et individus des Premières nations entendus lors de la phase des Audiences communautaires pour la présentation de la preuve orale de la Commission d'examen conjoint, ainsi que les actions politiques réalisées par des gouvernements, organisations et individus des Premières nations en parallèle aux audiences. Des conférenciers provenant de différentes nations ont fait ressortir les mêmes points en ce qui concerne le territoire, la propriété et le lieu en démontrant le bien-fondé de la souveraineté. Prenant comme base la théorie politique autochtone, nous faisons valoir que les témoignages recueillis indiquent que les positions autochtones sur l'oléoduc s'inscrivent dans une politique du refus dont la source se trouve dans les systèmes de savoir et de gouvernance autochtone, et non dans une simple réaction à la proposition de projet. Il est souhaitable que la théorie autochtone occupe une place centrale dans les perspectives critiques en géographie du développement des ressources naturelles.

Our investigations demonstrate that EAs play a significant, if indirect, role in Aboriginal efforts to regulate resource sector work. While Aboriginal communities increasingly rely upon private negotiations with development proponents to secure resource sector employment, participation in EA processes provides Aboriginal peoples a space to negotiate language around employment commitments and leverage to secure Aboriginal employment provisions in impact benefit agreements with project proponents.

AB  - Sometime in the spring of 2022, several Nechako River First Nations hope the British Columbia, Canada Supreme Court will rule in their favor in a lawsuit against Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. that would address their concerns about the health of the river. But they are also hoping for a compromise that would restore river flows to the Nechako without having to remove the Kenney Dam and shut down Rio Tinto's BC Works aluminum smelter in Kitimat. Chief Priscilla Mueller of the Saikuz First Nation said Rio Tinto has lately shown some willingness to listen to the concerns of First Nations, which are focused mainly on the negative impact the dam and low river flows have had on salmon and sturgeon.

AB  - Trends in abundance of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, were analyzed to quantify the ecological effects of water abstraction for electricity generation. In years when the majority of returning chinook adults used the upper Nechako River for spawning, the survival of offspring for the entire river was poorer than in years when spawning was concentrated in the lower reaches. Relative to the historical discharge, the upper Nechako River has experienced the greatest degree of water abstraction, and the lower survival of chinook broods originating from the upper river may be due to early emergence of fry caused by elevated fall and winter water temperatures or to higher rates of predation on juveniles and loss of rearing habitat caused by the elimination of the spring freshet. Poor recruitment resulting from broods spawning predominately in the upper river has caused the trend in the abundance of Nechako River chinook to diverge from the trend of chinook populations of similar life history from unregulated tributaries of the Fraser River. Additional reductions in flow may further affect the capacity of the upper Nechako River to produce chinook salmon.

AB  - The flow-diverted Nechako River is the second largest tributary of the Fraser River which drains 25% of mainland British Columbia, Canada. The watershed provides critical reproductive habitats for anadromous chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and year-round habitat for the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) population. In this study, the chemical quality of sediment in the upper Nechako River and its major tributaries was examined for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), legacy organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and furans (PCDFs), labile (exchangeable) metals/metalloids, and major nutrients (N and P). ΣPCB and ΣPBDE were detected in channel bottom sediments at all Nechako River and tributary sites; hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 4,4′-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) were also detected at most sites. Organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides were not detected in any samples. While ΣPCB, ΣPBDE, HCB, and 4,4′-DDE concentrations in bottom sediments were always well below provincial and federal guidelines for the protection of aquatic life, concentrations of total labile As (AsT), CrT, CuT, FeT, MnT, NiT, and ZnT in suspended and/or bottom sediments often exceeded provincial threshold effect levels (℡) and, in some cases, approached or exceeded probable effect levels. Distinct CuT, NiT, PbT and ZnT concentration maxima in suspended sediments were linked to road and urban densities. Historical PCDD, PCDF and PAH data show that concentrations in bottom sediment samples were highest at a site in the lower Nechako River between Miworth and the City of Prince George where PCDD and PCDF concentrations exceeded the interim federal ℡. Nitrogen and P concentrations in bottom sediments were negatively correlated with water velocity and sediment texture; the evidence suggests that reductions in velocity resulting from the 1952 diversion of the Nechako River have increased the nutrient content of bottom substrates.

AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination has been demonstrated in several animals, but in salmonids sex is generally believed to be under strict genetic control. We observed distorted sex ratios, attributable to a temperature manipulation during embryonic development, in experiments conducted during 1991 with the anadromous and nonanadromous (kokanee) forms of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Takla Lake, British Columbia. Sex ratios ranged from 62 to 84% female, and the biased ratio could not be accounted for by differential mortality by sex. The effect was observed independently in sockeye and kokanee crosses, as well as in the reciprocal hybrids. Similar crosses from Takla Lake in a previous year (1989) in which incubation temperature was not manipulated resulted in normal (1:1) sex ratios. Other populations of sockeye and kokanee from the same year (1991) but undergoing no temperature manipulation maintained normal sex ratios, as did populations from several disparate locations and years (1986-1994). The parsimonious conclusion is that the temperature manipulation during development was responsible for the biased sex ratio through a direct influence on sex differentiation. Hence, the possibility that temperature-dependent sex determination occurs in O. nerka, and perhaps other salmonids, deserves rigorous testing.

AB  - We evaluate the capacity of a regional climate model to simulate the statistics of extreme events, and also examine the effect of differing horizontal resolution, at the scale of individual hydrological basins in the topographically complex province of British Columbia, Canada. Two climate simulations of western Canada (WCan) were conducted with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (version 4) at 15 (CRCM15) and 45km (CRCM45) horizontal resolution driven at the lateral boundaries by global reanalysis over the period 1973-1995. The simulations were evaluated with ANUSPLIN, a daily observational gridded surface temperature and precipitation product and with meteorological data recorded at 28 stations within the upper Peace, Nechako, and upper Columbia River basins. In this work, we focus largely on a comparison of the skill of each model configuration in simulating the 90th percentile of daily precipitation (PR90). The companion paper describes the results for a wider range of temperature and precipitation extremes over the entire WCan domain.Over all three watersheds, both simulations exhibit cold biases compared with observations, with the bias exacerbated at higher resolution. Although both simulations generally display wet biases in median precipitation, CRCM15 features a reduced bias in PR90 in all three basins in summer and throughout the year in the upper Columbia River basin. However, the higher resolution model is inferior to CRCM45 with respect to rarer heavy precipitation events and also displays high spatial variability and lower spatial correlations with ANUSPLIN compared with the coarser resolution model. A reduction in the range of PR90 biases over the upper Columbia basin is noted when the 15km results are averaged to the 45km grid. This improvement is partly attributable to the averaging of errors between different elevation data used in the gridded observations and CRCM, but the sensitivity of CRCM15 to resolved topography is also clear from spatial maps of seasonal extremes. At the station scale, modest but systematic reductions in the bias of PR90 relative to ANUSPLIN are again found when the CRCM15 results are averaged to the 45km grid. Furthermore, the annual cycle of inter-station spatial variance in the upper Columbia River basin is well reproduced by CRCM15 but not by ANUSPLIN or CRCM45. The former result highlights the beneficial effect of spatial averaging of small-scale climate variability, whereas the latter is evidently a demonstration of the added value at high resolution vis-a-vis the improved simulation of precipitation at the resolution limit of the model. RESUME[Traduit par la redaction] Nous evaluons la capacite d'un modele regional de climat a simuler les statistiques d'evenements extremes. Nous examinons aussi l'effet de diverses resolutions horizontales, a l'echelle de basins hydrologiques individuels, en Colombie-Britannique, une province du Canada a la topographie complexe. Deux simulations du climat pour l'ouest du Canada ont ete menees avec le Modele regional canadien du climat (version 4), a une resolution horizontale de 15km (MRCC15) et de 45km (MRCC45). Les conditions limites provenaient de reanalyses mondiales s'etendant de 1973 a 1995. Les simulations ont ete evaluees a l'aide d'ANUSPLIN, un produit representant sur une grille les observations quotidiennes de temperature en surface et de precipitations, et avec des donnees meteorologiques mesurees a 28 stations situees dans les bassins versants de la partie superieure de la riviere de la Paix, de la Nechako et du haut Columbia. Dans cette etude, nous nous attardons surtout a comparer la capacite de chaque configuration du modele a simuler le 90(e) centile des precipitations quotidiennes (PR90). L'etude connexe presente les resultats pour un large eventail d'extremes de temperatures et de precipitations sur le domaine entier de l'ouest du Canada.Pour les trois bassins, les deux simulations presentent un biais froid par rapport aux observations. Ce biais est exacerbe a haute resolution. Bien que les deux simulations montrent un biais humide relativement aux precipitations medianes, le MRCC15 possede un biais reduit pour le PR90, et ce, dans les trois bassins en ete, et tout au long de l'annee dans le bassin du haut Columbia. Toutefois, le modele a haute resolution reste inferieur au MRCC45 en ce qui concerne les cas rares de fortes precipitations. Il montre aussi une grande variabilite spatiale et de moindres correlations spatiales avec ANUSPLIN, en comparaison avec le modele de resolution inferieure. Une reduction de l'ecart des biais du PR90 pour le bassin du haut Columbia ressort quand les resultats de modele a 15km sont lisses sur la grille de 45km. Cette amelioration s'avere en partie attribuable au lissage des erreurs relativement aux diverses donnees d'elevation utilisees pour les observations reparties sur la grille et dans le MRCC, mais la capacite du MRCC15 a resoudre la topographie est aussi evidente sur les cartes spatiales des extremes saisonniers. l'echelle de la station, des reductions modestes mais systematiques du biais du PR90 relativement a ANUSPLIN ressortent quand les resultats du MRCC15 sont lisses sur la grille de 45km. De plus, le MRCC15 reproduit bien le cycle annuel des variances spatiales entre les stations du bassin du haut Columbia, mais ni ANUSPLIN ni le MRCC45 n'y parviennent. De ces deux resultats, le premier revele l'effet benefique du lissage spatial des variabilites climatiques de petite echelle. Le second demontre nettement la valeur ajoutee de la haute resolution en raison de la simulation amelioree des precipitations a la limite de la resolution du modele.

AB  - The Wood Innovation Research Lab was designed as a low energy-use building to facilitate the construction and testing of engineered wood products by the faculty and staff of the Master of Engineering in Integrated Wood Design Program at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, BC, Canada. Constructed using a 533 mm thick-wall and 659 mm flat roof assembly, it received certification as Canada’s first industrial facility built to the International Passive House standard. Temperature and humidity sensors were installed in the north and south exterior wall assemblies to measure long-term hygrothermal performance. Data collected between 2018–2020 shows no record of long-term moisture accumulation within the exterior assemblies. Data collected during this time period was used to validate hygrothermal performance models for the building created using the WUFI® Plus software. Long-term performance models created using future climate data for five cities across Canada under two global warming scenarios shows favorable results, with an increase in average annual temperatures resulting in lower average relative humidity values at the interior face of the exterior sheathing board in the exterior wall assemblies.

AB  - BackgroundDespite successes in preventing and treating HIV, Indigenous people in Canada continue to face disproportionately high rates of HIV infection. Programs that support healing from lifetime trauma, support connection to culture, and reduce drug-related harms are critical to preventing HIV among young Indigenous people who use drugs. The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth intervention proposed here is a structured mobile-phone initiative to connect young Indigenous people who use drugs with Cedar Case Managers in a community-based setting. The intervention consists of a package of supports, including a mobile phone and cellular plan, weekly two-way text messaging, and support from Cedar Case Managers. MethodsThe Cedar Project WelTel mHealth study is a multi-site Zelen pre-randomized trial to measure the effect of a two-way supportive text-message intervention to reduce HIV vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in two Canadian cities. The trial is nested within the Cedar Project, an ongoing cohort study addressing HIV and hepatitis C vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. The Cedar Project Partnership, an independent body of Indigenous Elders, leaders, and health/social service experts, governs all aspects of the study. Two hundred participants will be followed over a 16-month period, with HIV propensity score at 6 months as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include HIV propensity at 1 year, HIV risk, resilience, psychological distress, access to drug-related services, and connection to culture measured at 6 months and 1 year. Primary analysis is by intention to treat. DiscussionCulturally safe interventions that address barriers to HIV prevention while supporting the strength of young Indigenous people who use drugs are urgently needed. Despite presenting a tremendous opportunity to connect young, highly transient Indigenous people who use drugs to prevention services, supportive two-way mHealth programs have yet to be tested for HIV prevention in a community-based setting with this population.

AB  - Background: Indigenous women involved in survival sex work face multiple layers of discrimination, criminalization and alarming levels of intergenerational and lifetime trauma. This longitudinal study examined historical, structural and interpersonal factors associated with survival sex work involvement among Indigenous women who have used drugs in British Columbia (BC), Canada.Methods: The Cedar Project is an ongoing cohort study involving young Indigenous people who have used illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Data was collected every 6 months from 2007 to 2016 . Generalized linear mixed-eﬀects modeling was used to model survival sex work involvement, deﬁned as exchanging sex for money, drugs, food or shelter in the previous six months.Results: Among 292 participants, 34% reported their family always/often lived by traditional culture and 37% reported their family always/often spoke their traditional language. In contrast, 48% had a parent in residential school and 72% were removed from their biological parents. In total, 55% of women were involved in survival sex work at baseline. In adjusted analyses, those who were single (ARR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.50–2.35), identiﬁed as two-spirit (ARR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.36–2.91), experienced sexual assault (ARR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.22–2.58), were denied access to shelter (ARR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.18–2.28), used crack daily (ARR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.36–3.31), used injection drugs (ARR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.98–3.07), and were unable to access substance use treatment (ARR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.15–2.05) were more likely to be involved in sex work.Conclusion: Indigenous-governed, wellness-based harm-reduction interventions, and structural reforms addressing housing insecurity and normalization of a culture of violence against Indigenous women, especially those involved in survival sex work, are urgently needed in Canada.

AB  - The Nechako Basin in British Columbia, Canada is suspected to have hydrocarbon potential. However, it has been a difficult basin to explore because of the presence of Tertiary volcanic outcrop. The volcanic outcrop makes the use of conventional seismic exploration methods difficult owing to a strong velocity inversion at its base. An alternative is the passive source method known as ambient noise surface wave tomography. The method, which examines the high-frequency surface wave field that is obtained from noise analysis, is sensitive to large-scale crustal structure and has been successfully applied to measuring the depths of sedimentary basins. Station-to-station Green's functions within the basin were estimated by cross-correlating the vertical components of the seismic noise data recorded by 12 POLARIS (Portable Observatories for Lithosphere Analysis and Research Investigating Seismicity) and CNSN (Canadian National Seismgraph Network) seismic stations between September 2006 and November 2007. The resulting Green's functions were dominated by Rayleigh waves. The dispersion characteristics of the Rayleigh waveforms were measured within the microseismic band. Inversion of the dispersion curves produced 1-D and 2-D thickness models and 2-D group velocity models for the Nechako Basin and its surrounding region. The velocity models indicate two low group velocity structures within the basin that might represent sedimentary packages, and some pockets of high-velocity zones that show the presence of volcanic rocks within and on the basin. The thickness models indicated the presence of about six different velocity layers, in which the average thickness of the basin and the crust are ~4.8 and 30-34 km, respectively.

AB  - The 'Ecohealth and Watersheds in Northern BC'' project, situated in a resource rich, settler colonial context, generated three digital stories at the request of the project's Steering Committee members that sought to connect health, environment, and community. Three Steering Committee members championed these stories from their distinct watersheds, resulting in emergent counter-narratives that respond directly to their social-ecological contexts. Nested in literature on blue and green spaces, we present and examine the process of storytelling as emergent counter-narrative and how these narratives challenge us to think of blue and green spaces in interconnected and nuanced ways.

AB  - The DNA sequences of four exons of the MHC (major histocompatibilty complex) were examined in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from an interior (Nechako River) and a coastal (Harrison River) population in the Fraser River drainage of British Columbia. Mhc class I A1, A2 and A3 sequences and a class II B1 sequence were obtained by PCR from each of 16–20 salmon from each population. The class I A1 and a pair of linked A2–A3 exons were derived from two different classical salmonid class I genes, Sasa-A and Onmy-UA, respectively. Allelic variation for B1, A1 and A2 was characterized by the high levels of nonsynonymous substitution indicative of the effects of natural selection on Mhc domains that contain peptide binding regions. The number of alleles detected at each of the four exons ranged from three (B1) to 22 (A1), but levels of nucleotide sequence divergence at all four exons were low relative to classical mammalian Mhc genes. The nucleotide similarity among alleles ranged between 89 and 99% over all exons, and all four domains possessed only two major sequence motifs. Allelic distributions at B1, A1 and A3 confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of the Harrison and Nechako chinook salmon populations revealed in previous studies. The two major allelic motifs of B1 and A1 segregated strongly between the populations. In spite of evidence that allelic diversity at these chinook salmon Mhc exons has been generated by selection, the level and distribution of diversity in the two salmon populations strongly reflected the demographic history of the species, which has been characterized by repeated bottlenecks and isolation-by-distance in glacial refugia.

AB  - RÉSUMÉ La communauté autochtone Nak’azdli Whut’en du nord de la Colombie-Britannique a reconnu l’importance de préserver et de partager entre les générations la sagesse, les connaissances culturelles et les traditions orales des aînés. Nous présentons les résultats d’un atelier intergénérationnel portant sur les récits numériques, dirigé par le Nak’azdli Health Centre, en collaboration avec des organismes communautaires et des partenaires universitaires. Dans le cadre d’un plan d’action participatif conçu conformément aux principes PCAP®, un atelier de 10 séances a été créé et mis à l’essai. La technologie WeVideo a été utilisée pour faciliter le partage des connaissances entre des élèves du primaire et des aînés. Les aînés ont partagé leur expérience et leurs connaissances à travers leurs récits. Les élèves ont enregistré les récits des aînés et y ont ajouté des images et des sons pour transposer la vision des aînés sous une forme numérique. Ainsi, les aînés et les élèves ont œuvré en partenariat pour co-créer des récits numériques constituant un héritage culturel pour les générations futures. Cet atelier était en accord avec le programme scolaire de la Colombie-Britannique. Il a favorisé les relations intergénérationnelles entre les aînés et les jeunes, a contribué à la préservation de l’identité culturelle et à la valorisation du rôle des aînés et des jeunes dans leur communauté. , ABSTRACT The Nak’azdli Whut’en, a First Nations community in northern British Columbia, recognized the importance of preserving Elders’ wisdom and sharing cultural knowledge and oral traditions across generations. We report learnings from an intergenerational digital storytelling workshop led by the Nak’azdli Health Centre in partnership with community organizations and academic partners. Framed by a participatory action design in accordance with the Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP ® ) principles, a 10 session workshop was created and piloted. WeVideo technology was used to facilitate knowledge sharing between elementary school students and Elders. Through storytelling, the Elders shared their wisdom and knowledge. The students recorded the stories and added imagery and sounds to capture their understandings in a digital format. Thus, Elders and students worked in partnership to co-create digital stories to create a cultural legacy for future generations. This workshop aligned with the British Columbia school curriculum, fostered intergenerational relationships between Elders and youth, helped preserve cultural identity, and facilitated opportunity for meaningful contribution for Elders and youth to their community. , DAKELH ABSTRACT Nak’azdli Whut’enne, no BC ’et Dakelh huwhut’i.

AB  - The alkaline playas near Atlin, British Columbia, Canada are likely one of the few surface environments on Earth where contemporaneous formation of hydromagnesite and magnesite occurs at temperatures that do not exceed 15 °C. This environment offers a unique opportunity to examine the impact of different formation mechanisms on Mg isotope compositions of Mg-carbonate minerals at low temperature. In this study, we report the Mg isotope composition of ultramafic bedrock, Mg-carbonate sediments, and both surface and ground waters in this geological setting. The composition of hydromagnesite suggests a Rayleigh-type distillation effect on the fluid Mg isotope ratios in unsaturated sediment above the water table. Through this mechanism of formation, hydromagnesite is progressively depleted in 24Mg obtaining δ26Mg values as high as +1.14‰ near the sediment surface. In contrast, magnesite formation is characterized by enrichment of the solid phase in 24Mg. The apparent Mg isotope fractionation factor during magnesite formation at ~10 °C ranges between -0.7 ± 0.1‰ and -1.8 ± 0.1‰. The distinct Mg isotope composition of hydromagnesite in comparison to magnesite supports magnesite formation occurring by precipitation from the fluid, or dissolution-reprecipitation, rather than solid-phase transformation from a hydrous Mg-carbonate precursor. Overall, the results provide insights on low temperature Mg-carbonate mineral formation that has implications for long-term storage of CO2.

AB  - Abstract The Challis-Kamloops belt of south-central British Columbia is a regionally extensive (&gt;65,000 km2) magmatic province that erupted within the North American Cordillera during the Eocene (55-45 Ma). The inland volcanic belt runs parallel to the coast, and the rocks were emplaced mainly within extensional basins indicating volcanism was attributed to rift-related decompressional melting. The rocks include both calc-alkaline and tholeiitic mafic and intermediate types (i.e., low-Fe, medium-Fe, and high-Fe suites). Voluminous volcanic units (Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, Swans Lake) of the Buck Creek volcanic complex (~3,000 km2 in area) within the Nechako plateau erupted within 1-2 million years and show significant internal chemical variability. All rock types have similar Sr-Nd isotopic (87Sr/86Sri=0.70435-0.70487; εNdt=+2.6-+4.0) ratios indicating they originated from the same sub-Cordilleran mantle source. Petrological modeling using the most primitive rocks of the Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, and Swans Lake magmatic pulses demonstrates that the chemical variability observed in each system can be explained by hydrous fractional crystallization in the upper crust (≤0.1 GPa) under moderately oxidizing to oxidizing conditions (ΔFMQ 0 to +0.7). The primary difference between the low-Fe to medium-Fe (calc-alkaline) Buck Creek suite model and the high-Fe to medium-Fe (tholeiitic) Swans Lake suite model is water content as the Swans Lake model has lower (H2O=0.75 wt.%) starting water than the Buck Creek and also the Goosly Lake models (H2O=1.25-2.00 wt.%). Moreover, the intermediate to silicic rocks of the complexes are compositionally similar to rocks associated with “slab failure” suggesting that rifting and mantle melting were related to asthenospheric upwelling through a slab tear. The implications are that the chemical variability of the rock suites are primarily related to fractional crystallization and that the mantle source is heterogeneous with respect to water content which is likely due to heterogeneities in the processes related to pre-Eocene subduction.

AB  - Habitat in the low-water channel of the mainstem Fraser River and larger tributaries during winter may be an unappreciated factor influencing production of stream-type chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in this system. Data from electrofishing surveys showed that shorelines were used by juvenile chinook from river km 110 to km 770. Almost the entire mainstem was therefore probably winter habitat, and major tributaries such as the Thompson, Quesnel, and Nechako rivers were also used. Estimated chinook density on the mainstem Fraser increased with distance upstream (maximum 0.30 m−2 at km 750 (Prince George)), but the highest density (0.99 m−2) in the surveys was observed on the Thompson River at Spences Bridge. The mean size of juvenile chinook decreased with distance upstream on the Fraser, ranging from 97 mm at km 110 to 65 mm at km 770. Chinook juveniles were feeding on Diptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera in winter. Some apparent growth was observed in the lower Fraser in early winter.

AB  - Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson) is an important lumber species in Canada, and seed orchards are expected to meet the increased demand for seed. However, seed production has been consistently low in the Okanagan region orchards of British Columbia, Canada. To determine whether the fungal microbiome contributes to seed loss, histological and molecular approaches were used. Seed production was studied at seven Okanagan orchards, all outside the natural range of lodgepole pine, and at one near Prince George, within its natural range. Seed losses were highest in the Okanagan, compared with Prince George. The role of fungal colonizers in consuming seed during the last stages of maturation is described. Fungal hyphae were frequently observed at all locations in developing seed, particularly once storage substances accumulated. Fungi identified from host tissues using molecular and morphological techniques included Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Sydowia. The opportunistic foliar pathogen Sydowia polyspora, which is known to have a variable biotrophic status, was detected at most orchards within different host tissues (seeds, needles, and conelets), in association with pollen, and in the air column. Reduced seed viability observed in Okanagan orchards is most likely due to a combination of factors, including composition of the fungal microbiome.

Traditional Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en practices and beliefs contain a number of elements which acted to promote conservation, including territoriality, prescribed burning, and proscription of waste, and other elements which are more difficult to reconcile with a biological model of conservation. The concept of humans as part of the natural world, and the requirement for respect for all natural entities are the fundamental to mediating human interactions with other species in the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en cultures.

AB  - Infestations caused by the mountain pine beetle (MPB) can be seen as complex spatio-temporal process with severe ecological impacts on the forest environment. In order to manage and prevent the insect infestation and reduce significant forest loss it is necessary to improve knowledge about the infestation process. The main objective of this research study is to design and implement a model based on decision trees (DT) mashie learning (ML) technique to forecast the spatial propagation of MPB infestation. The study is implemented in the Bulkley-Nechako region of British Columbia, Canada using data sets for the three time points 2004, 2008 and 2012. The results indicate that the derived DT can accurately characterize the relationships between the considered factors and MPB propagation. The developed DT method can be used to estimate future spread patterns of MPB infestations.

AB  - On July 13, 2005 a complex 3 Mm3 and 1.5 km long rock slide-debris avalanche occurred near Sutherland River, 40 km west of Fort St. James, British Columbia, Canada. The landslide was initiated in a succession of sub-horizontal competent mafic basalts (Endako Formation) capping weaker felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (Ootsa Lake Group) of Eocene age. Several landslides have been observed in similar volcanic successions worldwide including in southern British Columbia. Some common characteristics of these landslides are: structurally undisturbed; horizontal to sub-horizontal bedding; curved head scarp; steep joints; debris consists of intact blocks; volcaniclastics containing smectite (expandable clay mineral); fossils and lignite within the volcaniclastics. The Sutherland landslide is one of many large landslides that have occurred in recent years in northern British Columbia. At least eight other large landslides have been triggered in volcanic rocks within the Nechako plateau.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of the plant antifeedants, pinosylvin and pinosylvin methyl ether (PME), on suppression of feeding by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). Screening bioassays showed clearly that pinosylvin suppressed feeding by hares when sprayed directly on coniferous tree seedlings. Pinosylvin odor, when associated with food (but not mixed with it), also significantly reduced consumption of rabbit chow by hares. Large pen bioassays indicated that both pinosylvin and PME significantly reduced feeding on tree seedlings by hares when the antifeedants were sprayed directly on trees. In field bioassays near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, pinosylvin sprayed on trees and encapsulated in controlled-release devices of PVC plastic, with an internal wire as a twist-tie for attachment to tree, significantly reduced feeding by hares. Thus, pinosylvin will generate an “avoidance response” in terms of feeding by snowshoe hares. This response is likely triggered by an olfactory pathway based on positive results with controlledrelease devices attached to seedlings. Our study reports the first practical utilization of plant antifeedants for forest crop protection and wildlife management.

AB  - Population structure of three ecotypes of Oncorhynchus nerka (sea-type Sockeye Salmon, lake-type Sockeye Salmon, and Kokanee) in the Fraser River and Columbia River drainages was examined with microsatellite variation, with the main focus as to whether Kokanee population structure within the Fraser River drainage suggested either a monophyletic or polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Variation at 14 microsatellite loci was surveyed for sea-type and lake-type Sockeye Salmon and Kokanee sampled from 121 populations in the two river drainages. An index of genetic differentiation, FST, over all populations and loci was 0.087, with individual locus values ranging from 0.031 to 0.172. Standardized to an ecotype sample size of 275 individuals, the least genetically diverse ecotype was sea-type Sockeye Salmon with 203 alleles, whereas Kokanee displayed the greatest number of alleles (260 alleles), with lake-type Sockeye Salmon intermediate (241 alleles). Kokanee populations from the Columbia River drainage (Okanagan Lake, Kootenay Lake), the South Thompson River (a major Fraser River tributary) drainage populations, and the mid-Fraser River populations all clustered together in a neighbor-joining analysis, indicative of a monophyletic origin of the Kokanee ecotype in these regions, likely reflecting the origin of salmon radiating from a refuge after the last glaciation period. However, upstream of the mid-Fraser River populations, there were closer relationships between the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype and the Kokanee ecotype, indicative of the Kokanee ecotype evolving independently from the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype in parallel radiation. Kokanee population structure within the entire Fraser River drainage suggested a polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Studies employing geographically restricted population sampling may not outline accurately the phylogenetic history of salmonid ecotypes.

AB  - The 1911–2010 variability in monthly runoff and the effect of 1995–2005 summer water temperatures in a highly productive salmon system, the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, Canada are explored. Hydrometric data from 141 FRB gauges provide variations in monthly runoff including their extremes and months of occurrences, as well as trends in their variability. Stream temperatures and their relationships to runoff are also assessed. There is a gradual increase of monthly runoff ranges from the central plateau of the FRB towards higher altitudes with maxima in glacier-fed alpine streams. Maximum and minimum monthly runoff across the FRB typically occur during May–June and February, respectively. There is a tendency towards greater FRB variability in July runoff. Water temperatures show high variability in the unregulated North and South Thompson rivers and low variability in the regulated Nechako River. FRB low flows are associated with higher water temperatures, while high flows are associated with cooler ones, both of which may have a negative impact on salmon.Editor Z.W.

AB  - Objectives: Vulnerability to HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for indigenous populations worldwide must be contextualized in experiences of current and past trauma. Aboriginal women entrenched in poverty face further gender-specific harms which place them at increased risk for HIV infection. Methods: This study was cross-sectional and based on a community-based sample of Aboriginal young people (Metis, Aboriginal, First Nations, Inuit, and non-status Indians) between the ages of 14 and 30 years who used injection or non-injection non-cannabis illegal drugs (street drugs) in the previous month. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 543 participants living in either Vancouver or Prince George, Canada, were recruited by word of mouth, posters, and street outreach. Young people in the study completed a questionnaire administered by Aboriginal interviewers. Female participants (n = 262) were compared to male participants (n = 281) with respect to sociodemographics, trauma, sexual risk variables, and drug use patterns. Trained nurses drew blood samples for HIV and HCV antibodies and provided pre- and Post-test counseling. Results: Proportions positive for HIV and HCV were significantly higher among young women. HIV was 13.1% [9.5, 1.7.7] in women compared to 4.3% [2.5, 7.4] in men, and HCV was 43.6% [37.6, 49.8] in women as compared to 25.4% [20.5, 30.9] in men. When the analysis was restricted to young people who reported injection drug use, the proportions positive for HIV and HCV remained significantly higher among young women. Experiences of forced sex were reported by 70% of young women compared to 29% of young men, p < 0.001, while the median age of first forced sex was 6-years-old for both men and women. Discussion: The results of the final model indicated that HIV had been associated with residing in Vancouver, having injected for longer, and sexual abuse, but not being female. However, this gendered analysis demonstrated that a greater proportion of young women were experiencing sexual abuse, and sexual abuse was associated with HIV positive status. Harm reduction and drug treatment programs are urgently required that target women at a young age and address complex traumatic experiences associated with childhood sexual abuse.

AB  - While international instruments and a few state governments endorse the "free, prior and informed consent" of Indigenous peoples in decision-making about the water in their traditional territories, most state water governance regimes do not recognize Indigenous water rights and responsibilities. Applying a political ecology lens to the settler colonialism of water governance exposes the continued depoliticizing personality of natural resources decision-making and reveals water as an abstract, static resource in law and governance processes. Most plainly, these decision-making processes inadequately consider environmental flows or cumulative effects and are at odds with both Indigenous governance and social-ecological approaches to watershed management. Using the example of groundwater licensing in British Columbia, Canada as reinforcing colonialism in water governance, this article examines how First Nations are asserting Indigenous rights in response to natural resource decision-making. Both within and outside of colonial governance processes they are establishing administrative and governance structures that express their water laws and jurisdiction. These structures include the Syilx, Nadleh Wut'en and Stellat'en creating standards for water, the Tsleil-Waututh and Stk'emlupsemc te Secwepemc community assessments of proposed pipeline and mining facilities, and the First Nations of the Nicola Valley planning process based on their own legal traditions. Where provincial and federal environmental governance has failed, Indigenous communities are repoliticizing colonial decision-making processes to shift jurisdiction towards Indigenous processes that institutionalize responsibilities for and relationships with water.

While claims about economics, the environment and Indigenous rights dominate headlines, energy conflicts also feature struggles over the construction of space and scale. Building on work in energy geographies, this paper compares the spatial politics of three contested fossil fuel projects, focusing on how antagonistic parties frame issues to advance their positions, in turn shaping perceptions of scale. Drawing on reports, media coverage, and other secondary sources, we examine: the Trans Mountain pipeline in Western Canada; the Coastal GasLink pipeline in Wet'suwet'en territory, British Columbia; and shale gas drilling in New Brunswick. The analysis reveals how actors construct space and scale to persuade, build alliances, and exclude people or issues from consideration. Project proponents generally 'scale up' claims about benefits and 'scale down' impacts, while opponents do the opposite - even as both strategically engage with governance at multiple scales. We argue that taking spatial politics seriously can reveal power dynamics in competing representations of space, improve transparency in energy project evaluations by unveiling tacit proponent strategies, and reveal biases in impact assessment and legal processes when their mandates favour the spatial strategies of project proponents.

AB  - Objectives This study examined associations between childhood maltreatment, colonial harms and sex/drug-related risks for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young Indigenous people who use drugs. Design The Cedar Project is a cohort involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Indigenous collaborators, collectively known as the Cedar Project Partnership, govern the entire research process. Setting Vancouver is a large city on the traditional territory of the Coast Salish peoples. Prince George is a mid-sized city, on the traditional territory of Lheidli T'enneh First Nation. Participants 420 participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and returned for follow-up from 2003 to 2016. Primary/secondary outcome measures Primary outcomes were HIV and HCV infection over the study period. Secondary outcomes included sex and substance use-related risks. Results Prevalence of childhood maltreatment was 92.6% experienced any maltreatment; 73.4% experienced emotional abuse; 62.6% experienced physical abuse; 60.3% experienced sexual abuse; 69.5% experienced emotional neglect and 79.1% experienced physical neglect. We observed significant associations between childhood maltreatment and apprehensions into residential schools and foster care. All maltreatment types were associated with higher odds of sex/substance use-related risks; sexual abuse was associated with higher odds of HCV infection (adjusted OR: 1.67; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.66; p=0.031). Conclusions Findings reflect high prevalence of childhood maltreatment and their associations with HIV/HCV risk and HCV infection. Public health prevention and treatment initiatives must be trauma informed and culturally safe to support healing, health, and well-being.

AB  - In 2008, a Vibroseis seismic reflection survey was acquired by Geoscience BC across the eastern part of the volcanic-covered Nechako basin in central British Columbia, where Cretaceous sedimentary rocks have been exhumed along a NNW trend. Good signal penetration through the volcanic cover is indicated by lower crustal reflections at 8-12 s, which were recorded by the entire seismic survey. Comparison of the 2008 seismic survey with data from a previous survey indicates that the lack of reflectivity in the earlier surveys is generally representative of the subsurface geology. The seismic data show that similar to 1700 and similar to 2900 m thick sub-basins are present at the northern and southern ends of this trend, but the intervening Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous and relatively thin. The creation of a passive-roof duplex by Campanian or later low-angle thrusting is inferred within the thickest Cretaceous strata, but elsewhere faulting is likely related to Eocene extension or transtension. Seismic reflections are also recorded from folded volcanic stratigraphy, the base of the surface volcanic rocks, an underlying volcaniclastic stratigraphy, and intrusions projecting into a Quaternary volcanic cone. Seismic interpretation is complemented by coincident audiofrequency magnetotelluric surveys, from which faulting is inferred at offsets in a regional conductor. No regionally extensive stratigraphy can be identified within the seismic data, and the central Nechako basin appears to be a complex network of small, deformed sub-basins, rather than a single large basin.

AB  - Health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples persist globally. Northern interior British Columbia, where many Indigenous people live on Indian reserves allocated in the late nineteenth century, is no exception. This article reviews findings from fifty-eight interviews with members of thirteen First Nations communities in Carrier, Sekani, Wet'suwet’en, and Babine territories. The results suggest that colonial geographies, both physical and social, along with extant anti-Indigenous racism, are significant determinants of the health and well-being (or lack thereof) of many First Nations in the region.

AB  - With its headwaters in the water towers of the western Cordillera of North America, the Fraser River is one of the continent’s mightiest rivers by annual flows, supplies vital freshwater resources to populous downstream locations, and sustains the world’s largest stocks of sockeye salmon along with four other salmon species. Here we show the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model’s ability to reproduce accurately observed trends in daily streamflow for the Fraser River’s main stem and six of its major tributaries over 1949-2006 when air temperatures rose by 1.4 °C while annual precipitation amounts remained stable. Rapidly declining mountain snowpacks and earlier melt onsets result in a 10-day advance of the Fraser River’s spring freshet with subsequent reductions in summer flows when up-river salmon migrations occur. Identification of the sub-basins driving the Fraser River’s most significant changes provides a measure of seasonal predictability of future floods or droughts in a changing climate.

AB  - Climate change and resource development interact to have significant impacts on both natural and human systems within watersheds. It is, however, difficult to conceptualize and communicate these intersections, as climate change and resource development are each independently uncertain and complex. We facilitated a process whereby stakeholders created plausible future scenarios for the Nechako Watershed in British Columbia, Canada. This region is reliant upon, and has been significantly affected by, many types of resource exploitation. During a full-day workshop, 32 stakeholders created scenarios for 2050 envisioning high and low levels of both resource development and climate change. The high and low levels of climate change were based on downscaled projections from global emissions scenarios, and the resource development levels were determined at the beginning of the workshop by the participants. The exercise was educational, and motivated stakeholders to conceptualize plausible future changes and their impacts, and the outcomes should motivate stakeholders to work towards realizing a more desired future. All scenarios (even low-low) were deemed to have significant negative impacts, suggesting that the Nechako Watershed is in a vulnerable state. The complexity of the exercise suggests that more capacity building may be necessary.

AB  - Near the Pleistocene Termination, a glacier-dammed lake in central British Columbia suddenly drained to the south along the Fraser River valley. Floodwater travelled 330 km down the valley to Hope, British Columbia, and from there to the west into the Salish Sea near Vancouver. The flood was caused by the failure of an ice dam formed by the terminus of glaciers flowing from the central Coast Mountains across the British Columbia Interior Plateau. The ice dam impounded several hundred cubic kilometres of water to a maximum elevation of about 810 m asl (above sea level); at its maximum, the lake at the ice dam was over 250 m deep. Geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for the flood includes streamlined boulder-strewn bars, gravel dune fields, and terraces sloping up Fraser and lowermost Thompson valleys, opposite the present direction of river flow. The gravel bars and flood terraces are underlain by sheets of massive to poorly sorted gravel containing large boulders and rip-up clasts of silt and till. Shortly after the flood, a landslide near the northern margin of the former glacier dam impounded water to an elevation of about 550 m asl. This lake emptied due to overflow and incision of the landslide dam. The outburst flood from glacial Lake Fraser and the subsequent draining of the landslide-dammed lake deeply incised the older sediment fill in Fraser Valley and transported much of this sediment into the protoSalish Sea west of Vancouver, British Columbia and Bellingham, Washington. TCN ages on flood-transported boulders at three localities along the flood path agree with radiocarbon ages on inferred flood layers in ODP cores collected from Saanich Inlet, a fiord on southern Vancouver Island, 80 km south-southwest of Vancouver.

AB  - Quantification of climate change impacts on the thermal regimes of rivers in British Columbia (BC) is crucial given their importance to aquatic ecosystems. Using the Air2Stream model, we investigate the impact of both air temperature and streamflow changes on river water temperatures from 1950 to 2015 across BC’s 234,000 km2 Fraser River Basin (FRB). Model results show the FRB’s summer water temperatures rose by nearly 1.0 °C during 1950–2015 with 0.47 °C spread across 17 river sites. For most of these sites, such increases in average summer water temperature have doubled the number of days exceeding 20 °C, the water temperature that, if exceeded, potentially increases the physiological stress of salmon during migration. Furthermore, river sites, especially those in the upper and middle FRB, show significant associations between Pacific Ocean teleconnections and regional water temperatures. A multivariate linear regression analysis reveals that air temperature primarily controls simulated water temperatures in the FRB by capturing ~80% of its explained variance with secondary impacts through river discharge. Given such increases in river water temperature, salmon returning to spawn in the Fraser River and its tributaries are facing continued and increasing physical challenges now and potentially into the future.

AB  - Following completion of a regional geochemical survey on the Nechako Plateau B.C., follow-up studies were undertaken at Capoose and Fish Lakes, representing two contrasting limnological environments, in proximity to chalcopyrite-molybdenite occurrences. Sediments of Capoose Lake, a large oligotrophic body, are characterized by accumulation of hydrous iron and manganese oxides and a low organic matter content (average 6.7%). Fish lake is a small dystrophic to eutrophic lake with organic-rich sediments. Regional trace metal anomalies in sediments are recognised in both lakes. Greatest accumulation of metals characterizes a zone within 20 to 100 m of shore and immediately downslope of mineral occurrences. Anomalous distribution patterns within Capoose Lake appear to result from metal deposition from groundwaters emerging near the base of the nearshore slope, the copper and molybdenum being scavenged primarily by amorphous and crystalline iron oxides, respectively. Scavenging by organic matter promotes anomalous metal accumulations in Fish Lake. Accumulation of metal-rich elastics, particularly clay minerals, in proximity to inflowing streams can also be demonstrated for lead anomalies in Capoose Lake where the closest source of anomalous lead is 11 km upstream. However, deposition of elastic sediments by streams can also dilute anomalies. The Cordillera provides an excellent environment for studying base metal anomalies in lake sediments. Active mechanical and hydromorphic transport processes operating within drainage basins promote the formation of metal-rich zones which are easily recognized. These can be used similarly to detailed soil surveys to determine probable zones of metal enrichment within the catchment area.

AB  - The global population is growing at an incomprehensible rate and with it come complex environmental consequences that often result in social injustices. The United Nations has established a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in an attempt to ameliorate inequality and promise safety for the masses. To reach these goals, a set of indicators have been identified and their associated data for each country are publicly available to measure how close each country is to each goal. Multifaceted social and environmental processes that are difficult to understand are causing threats to these goals. Maps help reduce complexity. Now, arguably anyone with access to the Internet and time can make a map. However, not all maps are effective accurate communication vessels. Well-designed maps tell a story that truthfully represents the data available. Here we present a synthesis of the cartographic workflow pointing out specific considerations necessary when mapping SDG indicators. Along the way we illustrate the cartographic workflow as it relates to visualizing SDG indicators. Common mapping pitfalls are described and a range of suggestions to avoid them are also offered. Map makers have a unique opportunity to use these data to illuminate and communicate injustices that are documented therein to inspire creative localized solutions to eradicate inequality.

Focus group interviews were conducted with parents of children 0-6 years to discuss challenges and successes in healthy eating, active living and being screen smart. The focus group interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Three main themes emerged from transcripts which include: Barriers to Healthy Living; Parent Involvement; and Child Involvement. It is recommended that the Healthy Families Prince George committee design community initiatives to support families in the Prince George area to achieve optimal healthy living, based on the study results. Upstream social policies are warranted in order to support low socio-economic status (SES) male parents and their families to achieve healthy lifestyle including healthy eating and active living.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) may add new challenges during mass evacuations. Understanding the magnitude of the impacts EVs may have during the pre-departure stage of mass evacuations is an essential first step when planning for mass evacuations in a future where EVs are more common. In this paper, a generalized framework based on a G/G/c/N queueing model (general arrival process, general service process, c charging stations, and N EVs) was developed to estimate the number of vehicles that can be charged in the pre-departure evacuation stage and thus assess the pre-departure impacts. The model outputs are the number of vehicles that have or have not been served during the evacuation period, as well as average queue times and maximum queue lengths. This model is tested using the current electric vehicle fleet and charging infrastructure of Prince George, British Columbia, as a case study with a hypothetical short notice forest fire scenario. It was found that for the present-day case of Prince George, there is not enough charging network capacity to service all vehicles before departure. Increasing the number of charging stations, providing earlier evacuation notices, and ensuring a balanced makeup of level 3 fast-charging of different types were all found to be effective in increasing the number of EVs that received adequate charging before departure.

AB  - Respectful and reciprocal relationships with land are at the heart of many Indigenous cultures and societies. Land is also at the core of settler colonialism. Indigenous peoples have not only been dispossessed of land for settler occupation and resource extraction, but the transformation of land into property has created myriad challenges to ongoing struggles of land repatriation and renewal. We introduce several perspectives on land rooted in diverse Indigenous worldviews and contrast them with settler colonial perspectives rooted in Eurocentric worldviews. We then examine several examples in Canada where Indigenous nations attempt to reconnect with their homelands, protect them, and/or engage with them for economic development. We look at land relationships rooted in historical treaties, contemporary comprehensive claims/self-government agreements, the Indian Act, and the defence of unceded territories. The Indigenous communities we look at include the Six Nations of the Grand River, the Nisga'a Lisims Government, the Westbank First Nation, and the Wet'suwet'en. We contend that a complex configuration of settler colonial institutions challenges long-term efforts for Indigenous land reclamation, protection, and sustainable development, however, Indigenous nations remain steadfast in asserting their self-determination in diverse relational ways inside and outside of settler state systems.

AB  - The use of paleolimnology to reconstruct the collapse of the Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations following the landslides at the Hells Gate section of the Fraser canyon (British Columbia, Canada) is explicitly tested. Construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway caused a series of landslides in 1913–1914, partially blocking the Fraser River, preventing spawning salmon migration, and causing a near-complete collapse of upstream salmon stocks. We selected three sockeye nursery lakes upstream of Hells Gate, which varied in spawner density, migration length, and lake catchment characteristics. In each of the lakes, geochemical (stable nitrogen isotopes and C:N) and biological (diatoms) proxies failed to register the impact of a dramatic decrease in marine-derived nutrients (MDN). Additional variations in sockeye abundance, documented by the onset of commercial fishing and modern escapement records, were also not imprinted on the sediment record. Changes in diatom assemblages are coincident with 20th century climate warming and local catchment disturbances and are not attributable to variability in MDN subsidies. These results suggest that MDN do not remain within lakes in the Fraser River drainage long enough to become faithfully archived in the sediment record or that the lakes do not receive sufficient MDN to produce a recognizable sedimentary signature.

AB  - Water quality data have been collected at nine river sites in the middle and upper Fraser River Basin on a monthly or biweekly basis since 1985 under a joint program conducted by both Environment Canada and the British Columbia Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks. Statistical analysis of this data set for the period 1985 to 1990 was reported by Shaw and El Shaarawi (1995). The present work uses statistical techniques applied in this previous study to an additional 5 years of data. Techniques applied included a range of graphical and statistical methods, including a variety of commonly used non-parametric methods, parametric regression modelling and intervention analysis. After careful screening of the data for completeness and errors, a set of 8 stations and upwards of 43 were analysed. The suite of variables covered routinely measured chemical and physical parameters, such as physicals, dissolved ions, dissolved nutrients, microbials, total metals and, at a few localities, adsorbable organohalogens. Both increasing and decreasing trends in constituent concentrations were found throughout the basin, and in many cases these would seem to be related to natural phenomena. Anthropogenic influences were, however, clearly implicated in some of the strongest trends. Bleaching process changes implemented in the early 1990s had an immediate and dramatic effect in reducing levels of dissolved chloride. Other more subtle trends were perhaps related to human activity. Analyses of data from the one small-basin monitoring site, the Salmon River at Salmon Arm, identified trends in turbidity and dissolved ions may be related to development patterns in the watershed.

AB  - The Nechako River is an important waterway in North-central British Columbia (BC). The river forms the second largest tributary of the Fraser River and provides valuable habitat for salmon, white sturgeon and trout fish species. It is also central to the lives of several First Nations and non-First Nations communities in the region. People who live in the Nechako River Basin (NRB) enjoy easy access to the outdoors and a diverse range of recreational activities including hunting, fishing, boating and snowshoeing. The primary economic drivers in the region are related to natural resource extraction. The NRB has undergone many changes over the last 100 years. An abundance of hydro-electric, agricultural, forestry and mining activities have, and continue to, change the landscape. Most notably the Kenney Dam - constructed by Alcan in the 1950s to power an aluminum smelter in Kitimat – has permanently changed the hydrological and ecological nature of the basin. The current outbreak of the mountain pine beetle has also had significant impacts in northern BC, and is ultimately expected to kill up to three quarters of the mature pine trees in parts of the watershed. These changes have altered the NRB and the way that people live and work within it.

AB  - We describe refinements to a simple sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka rearing capacity model, the photosynthetic rate (PR) model, which was first described in an earlier paper. The model is based on a correlation between photosynthetic rate expressed as metric tons of carbon per year and sockeye salmon smolt biomass. Estimates of optimum escapements and spring fry recruitment required to produce maximum smolt numbers and biomass were taken from the Alaskan euphoric volume (EV) model. We define rearing capacity as the point at which the maximum number and biomass of smolts are produced and optimum escapement as the number of spawners that results in maximum smolt production. We compare model predictions to direct estimates of optimum escapements (developed from fry models—the relationship between numbers of spawners and numbers of fall fry) from two British Columbia (B.C.) lakes and discuss assumptions and limitations of the model. Although we currently have direct estimates of optimum escapement (e.g., fry models) for only two lakes that make up 16% of the total B.C. sockeye salmon nursery lake area, PR data are currently available for 57% of B.C.’s nursery lake area. We provide estimates of optimum escapements and smolt production from those lakes where suitable data are available. By making assumptions about productivity of lakes where PR is unknown, we also provide estimates of optimum sockeye salmon escapement to all major regions of B.C. Although more research and data are needed, the PR model is a promising tool to help managers make decisions regarding sockeye salmon escapement and enhancement.

The seven lakes are Takla, Trembleur, Stuart, Fraser, Quesnel, Chilko, and Cultus. After at least one month in formalin, each sample was measured and weighed. Summary statistics were calculated and length frequencies were plotted by survey and species. The results are presented in tables and graphs. Fall size of age-0 sockeye was smallest in Chilko (2.7 g) and Takla (2.3 g) lakes, mid-range in Trembleur, Stuart, Fraser and Quesnel lakes (3.l g to 3.5 g), and largest in Cultus Lake (4.l g). In Chilko Lake where biweekly or monthly samples were taken from May to September there was no significant growth until mid July when mean weight increased from less than 0.4 g to 0.8 g.

AB  - The study of sediment transport in riverine systems has historically focussed on the inorganic fluxes, although the suspended load is known to incorporate both inorganic and organic material. Research on freshwater flocculation indicates that sediment morphology and behaviour depend on both components, as biologic material can alter the hydrodynamic and charge properties of composite particles, which has implications for fine sediment transport and storage in stream systems. This study evaluates both the supply and the quality of the organic matter comprising the suspended sediment in a salmon-bearing stream in northern British Columbia, Canada. Seasonally changing hydrodynamic and biologic conditions are considered in the context of suspended sediment (seston) size. Seston samples were collected in an event-based design for analysis of organic matter sources, suspended particulate, inorganic and organic matter concentrations (SPM, SIM and SOM) and effective particle size distributions (EPSD). Organic matter sources were assessed using carbon:nitrogen (C:N) ratios and the associated stable isotopic signals. Samples and environmental measurements were taken during spring melt, pre-spawn low flows, active salmon spawning, post-spawn, and select rainstorms. SPM and SIM were elevated during active salmon spawning compared to that expected for the given hydrologic conditions. Seasonal patterns of C:N ratios and stable isotopes indicate that organic matter types can be differentiated in seston samples and these sources of organic material exhibit changing dominance in the seston over time. The isotopic signature of seston increases in salmon-derived nutrients when live and decaying salmon are present within the study stream. The largest suspended particles are observed during the period of active spawning when both live and rotting salmon modify instream conditions. This appears to be a function of the combined influence of high SIM, low shear stress, and low C:N ratios. The generation of increased floc, or seston size is of ecological importance in this stream and riverine systems elsewhere as it regulates the freshwater transfers of locally derived nutrients and sediments out of the fluvial system.

AB  - Evolutionary adaptation affects demographic resilience to climate change but few studies have attempted to project changes in selective pressures or quantify impacts of trait responses on population dynamics and extinction risk. We used a novel individual-based model to explore potential evolutionary changes in migration timing and the consequences for population persistence in sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka in the Fraser River, Canada, under scenarios of future climate warming. Adult sockeye salmon are highly sensitive to increases in water temperature during their arduous upriver migration, raising concerns about the fate of these ecologically, culturally, and commercially important fish in a warmer future. Our results suggest that evolution of upriver migration timing could allow these salmon to avoid increasingly frequent stressful temperatures, with the odds of population persistence increasing in proportion to the trait heritability and phenotypic variance. With a simulated 2°C increase in average summer river temperatures by 2100, adult migration timing from the ocean to the river advanced by ∼10 days when the heritability was 0.5, while the risk of quasi-extinction was only 17% of that faced by populations with zero evolutionary potential (i.e., heritability fixed at zero). The rates of evolution required to maintain persistence under simulated scenarios of moderate to rapid warming are plausible based on estimated heritabilities and rates of microevolution of timing traits in salmon and related species, although further empirical work is required to assess potential genetic and ecophysiological constraints on phenological adaptation. These results highlight the benefits to salmon management of maintaining evolutionary potential within populations, in addition to conserving key habitats and minimizing additional stressors where possible, as a means to build resilience to ongoing climate change. More generally, they demonstrate the importance and feasibility of considering evolutionary processes, in addition to ecology and demography, when projecting population responses to environmental change.

AB  - The early Stuart run of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) in the Stuart-Takla watershed is at risk from impacts of logging. Much of the effort directed at removing wood from beetle infested areas in the Bowron district has been redirected to the Stuart-Takla area. There are serious implications for altering stream temperatures and potential for impacts from sedimentation of incubation habitats. These fish spawn in large numbers (escapements of 10,000 to 300,000) in the tributaries of Middle River at temperatures considered to be at the upper limit for sockeye salmon. The relationship among forest harvesting and silvicultural activities and the productive capacities of aquatic environments in the interior of British Columbia is poorly understood as little fish/forestry research has occurred there.

AB  - Mortality in the early marine period in a particular habitat is related to the severity of the factors causing mortality and the time that juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. spend in the habitat. Juvenile sockeye salmon O. nerka produced in the Fraser River rear in the Strait of Georgia immediately upon leaving freshwater. We used catches from trawl and purse seine surveys to develop two estimates of their average residence time in the Strait of Georgia and present a third estimate which pertains to Chilko Lake smolts in particular. The average time between the entry of the last 1% of juvenile sockeye salmon into the Strait of Georgia and the departure of the last juveniles was 54 d. The average time between the point when the maximum number of juvenile sockeye salmon entered the Strait of Georgia and the point when the maximum abundance in the strait occurred was 43 d. Individuals from the Chilko Lake population were shown to spend a minimum of 31–43 d in the Strait of Georgia, indicating that an average residence time of about 43–54 d is plausible.

AB  - Sediment cores were collected from six lakes (Moose, Stuart, Chilko, Kamloops, Nicola and Harrison Lakes) distributed throughout the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia. The cores were dated primarily from 210Pb profiles and dating was corroborated by counting laminae and by using 137Cs as a discrete time marker. The cores were analyzed for a suite of metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Mn, Pb and Zn) and organic carbon. The data were evaluated in the context of post-1900 contamination by metals in the Fraser River basin. Overall, lake sediments from the Fraser Basin remain relatively pristine in terms of metal contamination, exhibiting only minor metal enrichments in layers dating from industrial times (post-1900). Stuart Lake, which received Hg contamination from a mine on Pinchi Lake, shows a clear contaminant Hg signal. Pb exhibits ubiquitous contamination in five of the six lakes studied. The Pb enrichments are minor (ranging from 8.4 to 30.9 μg g-1) and consistent with local automotive emissions from the use of leaded gasoline possibly augmented by long-range transport from industrial and municipal centers along the west coast. The largest Pb fluxes were observed in Kamloops, Moose and Harrison Lakes, each of which has either a highway or a large urban centre as a local source of Pb. This watershed-scale evaluation offers a unique opportunity to compare the relative importance of local and regional sources of contamination.

Water temperatures were managed by regulating Skins Lake Spillway releases to control flows in the Nechako River below Cheslatta Falls and at Vanderhoof. In 2010, mean daily water temperatures in the Nechako River above the Stuart River confluence did exceed 20.0°C (68.0°F) on July 10 through July 13, and July 28 reaching a maximum temperature of 20.1°C (68.1°F) on July 28. The first three exceedances occurred prior to the water temperature control period and the latter occurred when the river discharge was at the maximum permitted under the operating protocol. Over the duration of the 2010 Summer Water Temperature and Flow Management Project (July 10 to August 20), the total volume of water released was 8,856.2 m³/s-d, (312,756 cfs-d), and the average release during the Project was 210.9 m³/s (7446.6 cfs).

This water temperature control period is typically from July 20 to August 20. However, following a request by the Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program Technical Committee in response to an earlier than normal sockeye migration, the Project was initiated early, and started on July 6. Water temperatures were managed by regulating Skins Lake Spillway releases to control flows in the Nechako River below Cheslatta Falls and at Vanderhoof. In 1998, mean daily water temperatures in the Nechako River above Stuart River exceeded 20.0°C (68.0°F) on ten days (July 26 to August 4) during July 15 to August 20, with a maximum mean daily temperature of 21.8°C (71.2°F) recorded on July 31. During the period of July 26 to August 4, flow in the Nechako River below Cheslatta Falls was at or near the maximum allowable level of 283 m3/s (10,000 cfs), and thus no further action could be taken. The total volume of water released was 9,801.7 m3/s-d (346,144 cfs-d) and the average release was 213.1 m3/s (7,525 cfs) over the duration of the 1998 Summer Water Temperature and Flow Management Project (July 6 to August 20).

AB  - Data collected on juvenile chinook salmon rearing in the Nechako River system between August and September 1985 and between May and July 1986 are presented. Seasonal distribution and abundance of juvenile chinook salmon within the river and its tributaries were determined. Microhabitat criteria for juvenile chinook were studied. Using a variety of sampling techniques, data on fish length, height above bottom, wet weight, water temperature, depth and velocity were collected. A series of marginal and mid-channel dives were conducted to determine the lateral distribution of juvenile chinook in the river. On four occasions sampling was conducted for day and night distribution. Electroshocking in the lower reaches of eight tributaries was conducted to obtain an index of tributary use of juvenile chinook salmon. Selected microhabitat conditions were found to change significantly with the increasing size of juvenile chinook. Microhabitat characteristics selected by juveniles of the same size varied between reaches of the Nechako River. Day and night distribution of juveniles in the Nechako suggested they redistribute along the shallow river margins at night to feed and reform into loose schools next to wood accumulations for safetey during the day.

AB  - Early and Late Stuart sockeye are two of the most vulnerable salmon populations in the Fraser River by virtue of their extended migration distance covering 1200 km from the Fraser River mouth. The fish are highly valued by the First Nations from the Upper Fraser who depend on the runs for food, social and ceremonial purposes. Since the late 1990’s, both populations have declined severely and there are major concerns about the future survival of these sockeye runs. The Upper Fraser Fisheries Conservation Alliance undertook this review to summarize the status of Early and Late Stuart sockeye and to analyze the causes for the declines. Since 1938, Early Stuart escapements have fluctuated in abundance, and low escapements occurred during the 1950’s and 1960’s. The population re-bounded during the 1970’s and 1980’s, but has declined steadily since the mid-1990’s. The main factor in the recent demise of the population has been a crash in the Driftwood River population that started in 1997.

The terms of the agreement included a commitment that the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (D.F.O.), on behalf of the federal govemment, would conduct applied research on specific areas of concem. One area of concern was the potential impact of reduced flows and altered temperatures on predation of juvenile chinook salmon within the Nechako River. This study was carried out in partial fulfilment of D.F.O.'s commitment to that applied research program and specifically examines the potential of various fish species to consume juvenilechinook salmon prior to further water withdrawal.

AB  - We outlined the route and relative timing of juvenile Sockeye Salmon Oncorhynchus nerka migration by analyzing stock composition and relative CPUE in marine sampling conducted in coastal British Columbia and the Gulf of Alaska. Variation at 14 microsatellites was analyzed for 10,500 juvenile Sockeye Salmon obtained from surveys conducted during 1996–2011. Using a 404-population baseline, we identified the sampled individuals to 47 populations or stocks of origin. Stock compositions of the mixtures increased in diversity in more northerly sampling locations, indicating a general northward movement of juveniles. The primary migration route of Columbia River and Washington stocks was northward along the west coast of Vancouver Island, with a majority of the juveniles subsequently migrating through Queen Charlotte Sound and Dixon Entrance. Fraser River stocks migrated principally through the Strait of Georgia and Johnstone Strait. Some Fraser River populations, such as the Cultus Lake population, appeared to spend little time rearing in the Strait of Georgia, as individuals from this population were primarily observed in July samples from Hecate Strait, Dixon Entrance, and Southeast Alaska. Other Fraser River populations, such as the Chilko Lake and Quesnel Lake populations, were widely distributed during July surveys, as they were observed from the Gulf of Alaska to the Strait of Georgia. For the British Columbia central coast and Owikeno Lake stocks, not all individuals migrated northward in the summer: some individuals were still present in local areas during the fall and winter after spring entry into the marine environment. Juvenile Fraser River Sockeye Salmon dominated the catch of juveniles at the Yakutat, Prince William Sound, Kodiak Island, and Alaska Peninsula sampling locations. There was a wide divergence among stocks in dispersion among sampling locations. Received September 26, 2013; accepted June 6, 2014

Most fishforestry studies had been conducted in coastal regions and fisheries managers in interior regions had incorporated into forest harvest plans measures for stream protection that were derived from coastal experiences. However, because coastal regions differ from interior regions with respect to climate, hydrology, soils, forest cover and logging methods, this approach was frequently questioned by both foresters and biologists who recognized the need for data applicable to interior regions.

AB  - – We examined the site fidelity of spawning adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) by tagging and releasing fish in the same stream reach (controls) and displacing them among different but nearby sites (c. 50 m away). Three sites – two above a stream junction (‘upper’ reach and ‘pond’) and one below (‘lower’ reach) – allowed us to compare the behavior of salmon in the presence and absence of olfactory cues and habitat similarity. Most controls of both sexes (90%) remained in the immediate vicinity of the tagging and release site. When displaced downstream, where the odors of both the upper reach and the pond were detectable, most salmon returned to their former site (65%). Displaced sockeye were more likely to return to the pond from the lower reach than from the upper one (P = 0.05), consistent with olfactory orientation and the hypothesis that salmon prefer certain habitats. Salmon displaced from the upper to the lower reach were much more likely to return than those displaced to the pond (P < 0.01), consistent with the role of odors in orientation and inconsistent with the habitat choice hypothesis.

A total of 9,273 O. nerka (9,064 age-0, 60 age-1, 149 age-2+) were captured from the study lakes over the three years. We also captured 18 sculpin (Cottus asper), 21 whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), 1 redside shiner (Richardsonius balteatus), 4 lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush), and 2 burbot (Lota Iota). Mean length and weight of age-0 O. nerka collected in the fall and preserved in formalin was 69 mm and 3.73 g in Stuart lake, 78 mm and 5.74 g in Trembleur lake and 64 mm and 3.02 g in Takla lake. Strontium/calcium ratios in the core of the otolith were used to indicate the maternal origin of O. nerka sampled in the summer of 1997. There was a clear separation between anadromous sockeye (>0.7) and non-anadromous kokanee <0.7).

AB  - Sediment cores were collected from six lakes in the Fraser drainage basin (Moose, Stuart, Kamloops, Nicola, Chilko and Harrison Lakes). Cores have been dated, primarily using 210Pb and secondarily by counting varves or measuring 137Cs where possible. Sections from the cores have been analyzed for a suite of hydrocarbon compounds including alkanes and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). A preliminary examination of the data using down core profiles and multivariate techniques (Principal Components Analysis) reveals a complex pattern of hydrocarbons both in terms of history and compound distribution. All lake sediments contain detectable alkane and PAH compounds but there are differences between lakes and between sediment depths within lakes. The predominant signal in alkanes likely derives from natural sources including lake algae (e.g., nC17, ) and terrestrial plant waxes (e.g., odd carbon alkanes between nC23 and nC33) although, in the case of Kamloops Lake sediments, petroleum has also contributed alkanes. The algal alkanes show diagenetic loss on going down the cores. PAHs in the lake sediments derive from both natural and anthropogenic sources. Harrison and Nicola Lakes show increases in combustion PAHs in the early 1900s with decreases after about the 1950s consistent with changes from coal to liquid fuels. Kamloops Lake also shows clear PAH contamination probably from both combustion and petroleum inputs. Work is in progress toward a detailed assessment of hydrocarbons in the lake sediments in the context of local and regional sources and pathways.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic compounds (PACs) are ubiquitous across environmental media in Canada, including surface water, soil, sediment and snowpack. Information is presented according to pan-Canadian sources, and key geographical areas including the Great Lakes, the Alberta Oil Sands Region (AOSR) and the Canadian Arctic. Significant PAC releases result from exploitation of fossil fuels containing naturally-derived PACs, with anthropogenic sources related to production, upgrading and transport which also release alkylated PACs. Continued expansion of the oil and gas industry indicates contamination by PACs may increase. Monitoring networks should be expanded, and include petrogenic PACs in their analytical schema, particularly near fuel transportation routes. National-scale roll-ups of emission budgets may not expose important details for localized areas, and on local scales emissions can be substantial without significantly contributing to total Canadian emissions. Burning organic matter produces mainly parent or pyrogenic PACs, with forest fires and coal combustion to produce iron and steel being major sources of pyrogenic PACs in Canada. Another major source is the use of carbon electrodes at aluminum smelters in British Columbia and Quebec. Temporal trends in PAC levels across the Great Lakes basin have remained relatively consistent over the past four decades. Management actions to reduce PAC loadings have been countered by increased urbanization, vehicular emissions and areas of impervious surfaces. Major cities within the Great Lakes watershed act as diffuse sources of PACs, and result in coronas of contamination emanating from urban centres, highlighting the need for non-point source controls to reduce loadings.

AB  - To establish if there are sex-specific differences in the utilization of specific fatty acids in salmon during migration, we monitored plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) in male and female early-run Stuart sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, during their spawning migration in the Fraser River. Total plasma NEFA concentrations declined in both males and females to 60 and 40% of their respective initial levels. Palmitic (C16:0), oleic (C18:1), docosahexaenoic (C22:6n3), and eicosapentaenoic (C20:5n3) acids consistently represented between 66 and 77% of the total plasma NEFAs throughout the migration. These fatty acids are probably utilized as a source of energy to sustain swimming during the migration. A difference in monoene levels between sexes suggest that females utilized monoenes, particularly oleic acid, for yolk production. Fatty acid concentrations of the n6) series remained constant in both sexes; however, a sudden increase of C20 polyunsaturate proportions of both the n3 and n6 series was observed at the time of gonadal maturation in both sexes. While plasma NEFAs are important as energy sources for migrating sockeye salmon, there is also a selective utilization of plasma NEFAs for gonadal development and reproduction that is reflected in altered NEFA profiles of male and female fish, respectively.

AB  - Diatom-based paleolimnological approaches were used to determine the effects of cultural impacts on eutrophication histories in four lakes from central British Columbia. Stratigraphic analysis of fossil diatoms in 210Pb-dated cores and inferences of past total phosphorus concentrations using diatom-based models were used to reconstruct the nutrient histories of Takysie, Tchesinkut, Francois, and Tyhee lakes. Diatom microfossils indicate that these lakes are probably naturally productive, but some nutrient enrichment has likely occurred in response to human development (since A.D. 1850), particularly in Tyhee Lake. However, in Tchesinkut and Francois lakes, some reduction in total phosphorus may have occurred in recent decades. Takysie, Tchesinkut, and Francois lakes have been dominated by planktonic diatoms indicative of high productivity (e.g., Stephanodiscus, Asterionella, Fragilaria crotonensis, Aulacoseira). Tyhee Lake has been dominated by benthic Fragilaria species, but Stephanodiscus minutulus has increased in recent decades. These data were pooled with previously published paleolimnological data from British Columbia to summarize cultural eutrophication patterns in this region. Out of 11 British Columbia lakes considered, 10 were productive before human intervention, but 7 eutrophied further as a result of human activities. One lake exhibited no obvious post-1850 change in diatom assemblage, suggesting little human impact on water quality. In three of the lakes, recent improvements in water quality may have occurred in response to recent mitigation efforts.Key words: eutrophication, paleolimnology, British Columbia, diatoms, lakes, mining.

AB  - Parent and alkyl PAHs (51 compounds and alkyl homologues) have been quantified in suspended particulates and sediments (345 samples) from the Fraser River system, British Columbia, Canada. The best potential to distinguish natural and anthropogenic sources is exhibited by ratios of the principal mass 178, 202, 228 and 276 parent PAHs, 1,7/2,6+1,7-DMP (dimethylphenanthrene), the phenanthrene/anthracene and fluoranthene/pyrene alkyl PAH series and several less commonly applied PAHs (e.g. acephenanthrylene and pentaphene). Using these ratios we infer sources of PAH to the Fraser basin and evaluate the consistency of these source assignments and the suitability of various commonly applied PAH ratios as indicators. PAH ratios and total concentration data reveal a basin lightly impacted by a variety of sources in its remote regions, especially near roads, but heavily impacted in urban areas, particularly near Vancouver. Contamination sources shift from biomass (e.g. wood and grass) burning to vehicle emissions between remote and urban locations. Stormwater and wastewater discharges appear to collect PAH from urban areas and release them as point sources. In contaminated areas ratios are specific for combustion vs. petroleum sources, and some ratios (202 and 276) distinguish biomass or coal from liquid fossil fuel combustion. At lower concentrations multiple sources at times make interpretations based on a single ratio misleading and the higher mass ratios (228 and 276) may be most applicable to urban areas. In all cases the examination of a variety of PAH indicator ratios that encompass a range of masses is necessary for a robust interpretation.

AB  - In 2009 adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) carcasses were recovered from the Nechako River in order to collect biological data on sex, size, fecundity, egg retention, life history and age. This information contributes to the database being compiled under the auspices of the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program to monitor the Nechako Chinook population. A total of 200 carcasses were collected on the Nechako River between September 18th and 30th. Nechako River Chinook carcasses recovered in 2009 exhibited similar biological characteristics to those collected from 1988 to 2008. Values for the female to male ratio of the sample and the mean post-orbital hypural length for both males and females fell within the ranges observed in previous years. The spawning population was almost exclusively comprised of individuals with a stream-type life history and dominated by the 5(2) age-class.

AB  - The impact of freshwater environmental factors on spawning migration mortality was modeled to provide a predictive tool for fisheries management of four run timing groups of Fraser River sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka: early Stuart (Stuart Lake), early summer, summer, and late. We tested the significance of different measures of water temperature, discharge, fish abundance, and entry timing for forecasting discrepancies between lower-river and upriver escapement estimates using multiple regressions of principal component scores. Descriptive discrepancy models (i.e., “management adjustment” models) identified using Akaike's information criterion were consistent with the known biology of each group. For example, temperature and discharge thresholds were selected for early Stuart run discrepancy models, reflecting the extremes in both variables experienced by these early migrants. Predictive discrepancy models were also generated for each run timing group by using the limited number of environmental variables that are available in-season to fisheries managers. Even predictive discrepancy models using simple environmental metrics of average river temperature, flow, and river entry timing provide a valuable tool for forecasting relative indices of spawning migration mortality. This study provides an example of how environmentally based predictive tools can be used to inform fisheries management decisions and improve the probability of achieving spawning escapement targets.

AB  - Considerable new data on the characteristics of sockeye fry and smolt migrations, direct underwater observations of migrating smolts, and a review of the literature are presented here with a synthesis, evaluation, and interpretation of possible survival advantages of these phenomena. Most fry migrations from spawning areas to nursery lakes take place in the spring, when harsh winter conditions in lakes are moderating and the growing season is beginning. Smolt migrations to salt water closely follow spring breakup of the ice and warming of the lake water. The time of smolt migration is correlated closely with latitude: migration is earlier in southern streams than in northern streams. The duration of seasonal migration appears to be strongly related to travel distance to the trunk river outlet. The smolt exodus is rapid and regular in single-lake systems but irregular and extended in multilake or multibasin systems. The frequency distribution of smolts migrating from two-lake or two-basin systems is usually bimodal. Most migrations commence as water temperatures near 40 F and are over when temperatures approach 50 F. Migrations of smolts and especially fry are mainly confined to the darkest hours of the night. In general, in any one season, the oldest and the largest smolts in each age-group migrate first. Other factors, such as the thickness of the ice, effectiveness of solar radiation in melting ice and warming water, and daily weather (including sunlight and wind), also influence seasonal and diel migration patterns. Underwater observations of smolts at night during migration show that they are schooled, travel in the upper water levels in shallow rivers and deeper (but not near the bottom) in deeper rivers, and usually face downstream and swim as they migrate. During migrations, fry and smolts are both often subjected to a depensatory mortality from intense predation by birds and fish. A factor disporportionately affecting different smolt populations is the length and number of restricted passages along the route to the ocean. Smolts migrating in multilake systems must encounter heavier predation than smolts migrating from single-lake systems. Predation is probably minimized en route because of innate migratory behavior patterns. Exceptions to the general migratory behavior of fry and smolts are described to show the wide range in behavioral response to variable environmental situations.

AB  - The Nechako River is an important Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) producing tributary of the Fraser River that is regulated for electricity production. We monitored downstream migration and distribution of juvenile Chinook Salmon in the middle and lower reaches of the Nechako River in 1996 and relate our findings to concurrent studies that were conducted by the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program in the upper river. Age-0 Chinook Salmon in the Nechako River emerged from spawning beds in April and May in the upper river and we found juveniles moved downstream to the lower river in June and July. In contrast, in the tributary Stuart River, juveniles migrated considerable distances immediately after emergence and entered the lower Nechako River in May. Juveniles were found to leave the Nechako River and enter the Fraser River from May through July. Shoreline sampling revealed that juvenile abundance throughout the river peaked early June and declined afterwards, likely as a result of mortality or downstream dispersal. By the end of the summer, juveniles were more abundant in the lower river than further upstream. Our results illustrate the diversity of early freshwater life histories both within and among populations, highlighting the need to understand this diversity for the effective management of these populations and their habitats.

AB  - Thirty-five sockeye salmon nursery lakes in British Columbia and the Yukon were surveyed in 1977 to identify those lakes most likely to benefit from fertilization in future years as part of the Federal-Provincial Salmonid Enhancement Program. Salient limnological variables were measured and values catalogued for comparison among lakes within defined broad geographic regions. Plankton biomass, nutrients, and the ratio between mixed layer depth and compensation depth were used to rank lakes on the basis of their suitability for fertilization. Survey results are discussed briefly in relation to similar published western Canadian lake survey information and a rationale for selection of candidates for future study is provided.

AB  - Atlantic salmon parr, Salmo salar, undertook lakeward migrations from outlet streams in the Wings Brook system, eastern Newfoundland. Lakeward movement occurred from May through November, intensifying over a 6- to 8-wk period during spring. Parr remained in the lakes where they either matured (usually males) or smoltified (predominantly females) before returning to the streams. Mature parr emigrated from the lakes during autumn whereas smolts entered the streams during spring. Lakes provided conditions for increased parr growth and survival to the smolt stage relative to the riverine environment, and appeared to represent important overwintering habitat. Smolt production occurred almost entirely within the lakes. Parr movement into lakes could not be explained by physical environmental factors. Lakeward migrations appear to have an adaptive basis and can be explained as an evolutionarily stable reproductive tactic.

AB  - We used three methods to estimate sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) escapements that maximize production (S-MAX) in Fraser River lakes: (i) effective female spawners and adult returns using Ricker stock-recruit analysis (SR models), (ii) effective female spawners and fall fry or smelts (fry models), and (iii) photosynthetic rates (PR model), a modification of an Alaskan sockeye production model (EV model). Adult SR models were not useful in predicting S-MAX because of high variability in Shuswap and Chilko lakes (r(2) < 11%) and because of linearity in Quesnel Lake. Fry models using Ricker stock-recruit analysis provided S-MAX escapements of 0.90, 1.38, and 1.06 million for Quesnel, Shuswap, and Chilko lakes but were still highly variable (r(2) < 51%). Fry data indicated that fry numbers did not increase above escapements of 0.85, 1.5, and 0.51 million to Quesnel, Shuswap, and Chilko lakes. PR model predictions of S-MAX escapements to Quesnel, Shuswap, and Chilko lakes of 1.06, 1.85, and 0.62 million were similar to escapements that first produced maximum observed fry numbers. While fry models provide a direct estimate of rearing capacity, many years of data are required to generate a relationship for any lake. The PR model appears to be a useful predictor of rearing capacity and predictions can be made after 1-2 years.

AB  - A recent trend of enhancing freshwater emergent wetlands for waterfowl and other wildlife has raised concern about the effects of such measures on juvenile salmonids. We undertook this study to quantify the degree and extent of juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. utilization of enhanced and unenhanced emergent wetlands within the floodplain of the lower Chehalis River, Washington, and to determine the fate of the salmon using them. Enhanced emergent wetlands contained water control structures that provided an outlet for fish emigration and a longer hydroperiod for rearing than unenhanced wetlands. Age-0 and age-1 coho salmon O. kisutch were the most common salmonid at all sites, enhanced wetlands having significantly higher age-1 abundance than unenhanced wetlands that were a similar distance from the main-stem river. Yearling coho salmon benefited from rearing in two enhanced wetland habitats, where their specific growth rate and minimum estimates of survival (1.43%/d by weight and 30%; 1.37%/d and 57%) were comparable to those in other side-channel rearing studies. Dissolved oxygen concentrations decreased in emergent wetlands throughout the season and approached the limits lethal to juvenile salmon by May or June each year. Emigration patterns suggested that age-0 and age-1 coho salmon emigrated as habitat conditions declined. This observation was further supported by the results of an experimental release of coho salmon. Survival of fish utilizing emergent wetlands was dependent on movement to the river before water quality decreased or stranding occurred from wetland desiccation. Thus, our results suggest that enhancing freshwater wetlands via water control structures can benefit juvenile salmonids, at least in the short term, by providing conditions for greater growth, survival, and emigration.

AB  - Hawks Creek, a small tributary of the upper Fraser River where there is no record of spawning salmonids, was examined from May to November 1990 for the presence of juvenile salmonids. Age 0+ wild chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) appeared in May, increased to peak densities of 0.76 fish∙m−2 in late August, and were absent in November. Average residence time of marked chinook juveniles was 9 d. Duration of residency was size dependent, as small fish remained longer than large fish. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni) also had a short residency (mean = 21 d). We suggest that unsuitable rearing conditions (e.g., sediment load) in the mainstem Fraser River during the spring and summer favour the use of small, clear, and nonnatal tributaries by juvenile salmonids. Physical and biological explanations are proposed for their temporary use. These salmonid refuge habitats need to be protected.

AB  - The goal of Canada's Wild Salmon Policy (WSP) is to restore and maintain healthy and diverse salmon populations and their habitats for the benefit and enjoyment of the people of Canada in perpetuity. To achieve that goal, the WSP requires that biological status be assessed for all geographically, ecologically, and genetically distinct populations, or Conservation Units (CUs). One component of that assessment is identifying quantifiable metrics of biological status and benchmarks along those metrics. Here, we provide a toolkit of metrics and benchmarks of status, which will set the stage for future CU assessments. Specifically, we propose a multi-criteria approach for assessing status that uses information on current abundances, trends in abundance over time, distribution of spawners, and fishing mortality relative to stock productivity. That approach captures the multiple dimensions of population status that will be important to achieve WSP goals better than assessments based on abundances alone. Furthermore, any redundancy in information content among criteria may allow for increased flexibility when assessing stocks that differ widely in data quantity and quality. Here, we identify quantifiable metrics and candidate benchmarks drawn from the scientific literature and previous management experience. Using a simulation model, we further evaluate a subset of those benchmarks on two performance metrics: the probability of extirpation over the long term and the probability of recovery to a target. Finally, we apply those metrics and candidate benchmarks to two example CUs, Takla/Trembleur sockeye salmon (Early Stuart run-timing group of the Fraser River) and Hecate Strait Lowlands pink salmon (odd year).

AB  - We collected fish samples and measured physical habitat characteristics, including summer stream temperatures, at 156 sites in 50 tributary streams in two sampling areas (Upper Fraser and Thompson Rivers) in British Columbia, Canada. Additional watershed characteristics were derived from GIS coverages of watershed, hydrological and climatic variables. Maximum weekly average temperature (MWAT), computed as an index of summer thermal regime, ranged from 10 to 23 °C. High values of MWAT were associated with large, warm, low relief watersheds with a high lake influence. Measures of community similarity suggested that the fish community changed most rapidly through a lower transition zone at an MWAT of about 12 °C and an upper transition zone at an MWAT of about 19 °C. These results were confirmed using existing fisheries inventory data combined with predictions of MWAT from a landscape-scale regression model for the Thompson River watershed. For headwater sites in the Chilcotin River watershed (which drains into the middle Fraser River), the relative dominance of bull trout versus rainbow trout (based on inventory data) decreased with increasing predicted MWAT although the distinction was not as clear as for the Thompson River sites. The fish communities in these watersheds can be characterized in terms of very cold water (bull trout and some cold water species), cold water (salmonids and sculpins) and cool water (minnows and some cold water salmonids). The two transition zones (ca 12 and 19 °C) can be used to identify thresholds where small changes in stream temperature can be expected to lead to large changes in fish communities. Such clear, quantifiable thresholds are critical components of a management strategy designed to identify and protect vulnerable fish communities in streams where poor land use practices, alone or in combination with climatic change, can lead to changes in stream temperatures.

AB  - Several recent studies have highlighted the importance of salmon as a means to deliver biomagnifying contaminants to nursery lakes. There is a lack of studies, however, which demonstrate empirically how this source has varied through time. This is of great significance because past salmon-derived contaminant loading was potentially greater than it is today. By analyzing radiometrically dated sediment cores collected from ten lakes in Alaska and British Columbia (B.C.), we relate historical numbers of sockeye salmon spawners to ΣPCB concentrations and δ15N values (a paleolimnological proxy for past salmon-derived nitrogen) in the sediments. The results confirm that sockeye salmon have provided an important route for PCBs to enter the lakes in the past, a finding that is especially evident when the data of all lakes are pooled. Significant relationships between sockeye salmon numbers and δ15N, as well as ΣPCB concentrations and δ15N in sediments, were also found. However, it is difficult to establish relationships between salmon numbers, ΣPCBs and δ15N in individual lakes. This may be due to a number of factors which may influence contaminant loadings to the lakes. The factors include: a) changing salmon contaminant loads over time resulting from a lag in the upper ocean reservoir and/or changing salmon feeding locations; b) greater importance of atmospheric transport in lakes with relatively low salmon returns; and c) increased PCB scavenging due to higher algae productivity in the lakes in recent years.

AB  - Eggs of sockeye salmon taken from tributary, outlet, and beach spawners at Karluk, Alaska, were treated identically from time of egg fertilization through time of testing as fry in a laboratory. Test lots were released during the day and at night in a central release pool from which the fry could migrate either upstream or downstream through simulated stream channels. Oxygen-saturated water at 50 F (10 C) was pumped through the 40-ft (12.2-m) gravel-bottomed simulated stream at about 0.3 ft/sec (9.1 cm/sec).Test results showed that directions (upstream or downstream) and times (day or night) of migration differed substantially between fry from the tributary and those from the outlet. Fry from beach spawning reacted in a manner similar to that of the tributary fry. These differences were concluded to be of genetic origin. The possible interaction of innate behavior and environment in controlling the migratory movements of salmonid fry is discussed along with the significance of choosing a donor stock with appropriate innate responses to make best use of a new environment.

AB  - Projected shifts in climate forcing variables such as temperature and precipitation are of great relevance to arctic freshwater ecosystems and biota. These will result in many direct and indirect effects upon the ecosystems and fish present therein. Shifts projected for fish populations will range from positive to negative in overall effect, differ among species and also among populations within species depending upon their biology and tolerances, and will be integrated by the fish within their local aquascapes. This results in a wide range of future possibilities for arctic freshwater and diadromous fishes. Owing to a dearth of basic knowledge regarding fish biology and habitat interactions in the north, complicated by scaling issues and uncertainty in future climate projections, only qualitative scenarios can be developed in most cases. This limits preparedness to meet challenges of climate change in the Arctic with respect to fish and fisheries.

AB  - In descending order of importance, artificial spawning channels, density-dependent mortality, carryover mortality, and climate have significant influences on the average productivity of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). When factors that are known or have been hypothesized to affect Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity are included in a single analytical framework, no significant change in average productivity occurred in 1976/1977, however, beginning in 1989 average productivity was significantly lower. In the one lake (Chilko) in the Fraser River basin where pre-smolt survival can be distinguished from post-smolt survival, this decline arose from freshwater causes. After accounting for other factors that have a greater influence, Fraser River sockeye salmon productivity tends to be slightly lower in years when the intensity of the Aleutian low pressure region is stormier in winter, although the effect is not strongly expressed in any particular population. A footnote to the study was the realization that estimates of Ricker’s density-dependent mortality parameter, β, are influenced by both the numerical properties of the equation and by population biology; density-dependent and density-independent influences on the estimates of the parameter are confounded.

AB  - Resource management agencies in the Laurentian Great Lakes routinely conduct studies of fish movement and migration to understand the temporal and spatial distribution of fishes within and between the lakes and their tributaries. This literature has never been summarized and evaluated to identify common themes and future research opportunities. We reviewed 112 studies, published between 1952 and 2010, with the goal of summarizing existing research on the movement and migration of fishes in the Laurentian Great Lakes. The most commonly studied species were Lake Trout (Salvelinus namaycush), Walleye (Sander vitreus), and Lake Sturgeon (Acipenser fulvescens). Studies relied mainly on mark-recapture techniques with comparatively few using newer technologies such as biotelemetry, hydroacoustics, or otolith microchemistry/isotope analysis. Most movement studies addressed questions related to reproductive biology, effects of environmental factors on movement, stocking, and habitat use. Movement-related knowledge gaps were identified through the literature synthesis and a survey distributed to Great Lakes fisheries managers. Future studies on emigration/immigration of fishes through lake corridors, the dispersal of stocked fishes and of stock mixing were identified as being particularly important given their potential for developing lake- or region-wide harvest regulations and stocking strategies. The diversity of tools for studying fish movement across multiple years and various spatial scales gives researchers new abilities to address key science questions and management needs. Addressing these needs has the potential to improve upon existing fisheries management practices within the complexity of multi-jurisdictional governance in the Laurentian Great Lakes.

TY  - report
AU  - Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd.
SN  - WP#P0822
AB  - This report provides a framework to monitor components of biodiversity in Finger Tatuk Provincial Park as well as monitoring protocols for priority resource values focusing on lake fisheries. The proposed monitoring plan has been developed in response to concerns related to increased logging activities and road access in close proximity to the protected area, particularly along the southern park boundary. The overall intent of the monitoring plan is to determine the effectiveness of management strategies designed to achieve ecosystem management goals and objectives both within the park as well as areas outside the park that exert an influence on ecological integrity. A conceptual framework is provided outlining the approach and steps necessary to develop a monitoring plan including the selection of monitoring indicators. A broad range of prospective monitoring indicators and measures were evaluated for their potential application in the monitoring program. Selecting appropriate indicators and developing monitoring protocols for all biodiversity components, however, was not possible due to the general lack of existing information for many resource values. Consequently, the need for completing baseline inventories is emphasized to establish baseline conditions required for monitoring change over time. Indicators selected to monitor fisheries resources were generally inexpensive, easy to implement, and relevant (e.g., angler success) but were not considered strongly reliable as a direct measure of the health or status of fish stocks. It has therefore been recommended that several indicators be used in assessing change and more rigorous methods be employed if a negative trend is identified. Specific fisheries related monitoring protocols are provided as well as an implementation schedule for various monitoring activities including baseline surveys. In addition, the challenges associated with monitoring road access and human use is briefly discussed as well as recommendations to improve the development and implementation of future monitoring plans.

AB  - We used 13 microsatellite loci to examine population structure in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss collected from 20 tributaries and 3 main stems in the greater Spokane River drainage. Populations displayed some excess homozygosity and linkage disequilibrium, which was more pronounced in upper tributary collections and probably the result of small effective population sizes or structuring within tributaries. In general, population structure followed geographic structure; collections from creeks within sub-drainages were the most closely related, and collections from different tributaries were genetically distinct. Comparisons with cutthroat trout O. clarkii indicated little to no introgression. Comparisons with steelhead (anadromous rainbow trout), coastal rainbow trout O. mykiss irideus, and inland rainbow trout from hatcheries suggested introgression by hatchery fish into some wild populations. Introgression was suspected in populations from stocked tributaries and tributaries that lacked barriers to escaped hatchery fish. Populations from tributaries above barriers that had not been stocked were genetically distinct from hatchery fish and appeared to be native inland redband trout O. mykiss gairdneri.

AB  - Fine-grained sediment is a natural and essential component of river systems and plays a major role in the hydrological, geomorphological and ecological functioning of rivers. In many areas of the world, the level of anthropogenic activity is such that fine-grained sediment fluxes have been, or are being, modified at a magnitude and rate that cause profound, and sometimes irreversible, changes in the way that river systems function. This paper examines how anthropogenic activity has caused significant changes in the quantity and quality of fine-grained sediment within river systems, using examples of: land use change in New Zealand; the effects of reservoir construction and management in different countries; the interaction between sediment dynamics and fish habitats in British Columbia, Canada; and the management of contaminated sediment in USA rivers. The paper also evaluates present programmes and initiatives for the management of fine sediment in river systems and suggests changes that are needed if management strategies are to be effective and sustainable.

AB  - In this report we present summaries of our current knowledge of freshwater factors limiting sockeye production from 60 BC lakes. Data were collected between 1977-2000. Quantity of data available for each lake varied, ranging from intensive multi-year ecosystem studies on some lakes to one-time limnological surveys on others. The lakes are located in five of the six DFO management areas (none are in Yukon-Transboundary). Seventeen of the lakes are in the BC Interior, eight are in the Central Coast, four are in the Lower Fraser, the majority (25) are in the North Coast, and six are in the South Coast. They make up about two-thirds of the total sockeye nursery lakes in BC. Their total surface area is 3,586 km2, which is approximately 90% of the total area of BC nursery lakes. Freshwater factors limiting sockeye production in these lakes are varied, but in the majority of lakes and years fry recruitment is insufficient to fully utilize their productive capacity. Most of the lakes are oligotrophic and strongly nutrient-limited, thus juvenile sockeye growth and/or survival could be improved by nutrient additions. We identify opportunities for enhancement and restoration of the lakes' sockeye stocks, which in addition to lake fertilization include increasing escapements, fry outplants, spawning channels, improvements to spawning grounds, and control of competitors or predators.

AB  - Here, we review studies describing geomorphic processes affecting physical habitat, particularly salmonid spawning habitat as influenced by the supply, movement, and storage of coarse sediment through a channel network. Our examples are drawn primarily from the mountainous terrain of the Pacific Northwestern United States. Although not exhaustive, we examine processes of sediment supply and transport that operate in all rivers; the implications for spawning habitat depend on the spatial and temporal distribution of process rates, which vary both locally and regionally. Such a framework can help quantify these variations and guide development of analysis tools and collection of data to characterize basin-wide controls on habitat formation and alteration.

On maximum daily ration, optimum temperature for growth was approximately 19°C, above which feeding and growth decreased particularly above 22°C. Mortalities reached 64% at 25°C, in agreement with earlier studies on lethal temperatures. In comparison with Qualicum chinooks, Nechako juveniles had a lower growth rate and food conversion efficiency at all but the highest temperatures.

AB  - Fish of the family Salmonidae (salmon, trout and charr) are famous for their ability to learn (‘imprint’) olfactory information as juveniles and to use those odour memories as adults to home to their natal site for reproduction years later. However, the spatial scale at which salmonids home has not been determined, and this is important not only for an understanding of the imprinting and homing processes but also because homing determines the spatial scale at which salmon populations are structured. To test the hypothesis that salmon home to specific habitat units within a single small creek, we induced banding patterns on the otoliths (ear bones) of pre-hatch sockeye salmon embryos by altering the temperatures at which they were incubated. Thermally marked embryos were buried in a small pond associated with Hansen Creek, in southwestern Alaska, and allowed to complete development and migrate. In the year when the salmon were expected to return to the creek, examination of otoliths from carcasses revealed that 12 of 324 salmon in the pond were marked, whereas all 138 salmon examined in the creek were unmarked. This distribution of marked fish indicates that more of the experimental salmon returned to the pond than would have occurred by chance, although we cannot be certain that all surviving salmon did so. These results contribute to the growing literature indicating the capacity for very fine-scale populations structure in salmon.

AB  - The human footprint is now large in all the Earth's ecosystems, and construction of large dams in major river basins is among the anthropogenic changes that have had the most profound ecological consequences, particularly for migratory fishes. In the Columbia River basin of the western USA, considerable effort has been directed toward evaluating demographic effects of dams, yet little attention has been paid to evolutionary responses of migratory salmon to altered selective regimes. Here we make a first attempt to address this information gap. Transformation of the free-flowing Columbia River into a series of slack-water reservoirs has relaxed selection for adults capable of migrating long distances upstream against strong flows; conditions now favour fish capable of migrating through lakes and finding and navigating fish ladders. Juveniles must now be capable of surviving passage through multiple dams or collection and transportation around the dams. River flow patterns deliver some groups of juvenile salmon to the estuary later than is optimal for ocean survival, but countervailing selective pressures might constrain an evolutionary response toward earlier migration timing. Dams have increased the cost of migration, which reduces energy available for sexual selection and favours a nonmigratory life history. Reservoirs are a benign environment for many non-native species that are competitors with or predators on salmon, and evolutionary responses are likely (but undocumented). More research is needed to tease apart the relative importance of evolutionary vs. plastic responses of salmon to these environmental changes; this research is logistically challenging for species with life histories like Pacific salmon, but results should substantially improve our understanding of key processes. If the Columbia River is ever returned to a quasinatural, free-flowing state, remaining populations might face a Darwinian debt (and temporarily reduced fitness) as they struggle to re-evolve historical adaptations.

AB  - Large portions of anadromous salmonid habitat in the western United States has been lost because of dams and other blockages. This loss has the potential to affect salmonid evolution through natural selection if the loss is biased, affecting certain types of habitat differentially, and if phenotypic traits correlated with those habitat types are heritable. Habitat loss can also affect salmonid evolution indirectly, by reducing genetic variation and changing its distribution within and among populations. In this paper, we compare the characteristics of lost habitats with currently accessible habitats and review the heritability of traits which show correlations with habitat/environmental gradients. We find that although there is some regional variation, inaccessible habitats tend to be higher in elevation, wetter and both warmer in the summer and colder in the winter than habitats currently available to anadromous salmonids. We present several case studies that demonstrate either a change in phenotypic or life history expression or an apparent reduction in genetic variation associated with habitat blockages. These results suggest that loss of habitat will alter evolutionary trajectories in salmonid populations and Evolutionarily Significant Units. Changes in both selective regime and standing genetic diversity might affect the ability of these taxa to respond to subsequent environmental perturbations. Both natural and anthropogenic and should be considered seriously in developing management and conservation strategies.

AB  - From 1994 to 1996, behaviour and energy use by sockeye salmon spawning in Gluskie Creek, British Columbia, was investigated by a combination of behavioural observation and electromyogram (EMG) telemetry. The spawning life was 7.6 days for males and 10.6 days for females. Both sexes held in pools for a few days, with an average cost of 7.9 kcal/day, before starting to spawn. During spawning, dominant males performed 6 behavioural acts per 10 min, charging being the most frequent followed by quivering, chasing, digging, lateral and posture displays. Spawning females performed 4.4 behavioural acts per 10 min, digging being the most frequent followed by charges and chases. Following egg deposition, females entered a nest guarding phase and, in the latter stages of spawning, males adopted subordinate behaviour. Guarding females and subordinate males performed 1.1 and 1.6 behaviours per 10 min respectively. Lateral and posture displays by males lasted 6.3 s and 11 s respectively but all other behaviours lasted less than 2 seconds. Holding behaviour and posture displays required the most energy in males and holding and digging in females. Dominant males and spawning females expended 23.9 kcal/day whereas guarding females and subordinate males expended 11.0 kcal/day. Frequency of behaviours during active spawning was similar to other populations. Length of spawning life was shorter, however, and total energy expended was less than estimates for other populations based on body constituent analysis. Although EMG telemetry may underestimate total energy expenditure, other recent measures of gross energy expenditure by Stuart River sockeye also indicate that energy available for reproduction was low in this population due to declining average size and low energy reserves in fish arriving at the spawning grounds.

AB  - We evaluated the effects of past and future trends in temperature and discharge in the Fraser River on the migratory performance of the early Stuart population of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka. Fish of lower condition exhibited disproportionately higher mortality during the spawning run, elucidating a critical link between energetic condition and a fish's ability to reach the spawning grounds. We simulated spawning migrations by accounting for energetic demands for an average individual in the population from the time of entry into the Fraser River estuary to arrival on the spawning grounds (about 1,200 km upstream) and estimated energy expenditures for the average migrant during 1950–2001. The model output indicates relatively high interannual variability in migration energy use and a marked increase in energy demands in recent years related to unusually high discharges (e.g., 1997) and warmer than average water temperature (e.g., 1998). We examined how global climate change might effect discharge, water temperature, and the energy used by sockeye salmon during their spawning migration. Expected future reductions in peak flows during freshets markedly reduced transit time to the spawning ground, representing a substantial energy savings that compensated for the effect of the increased metabolic rate resulting from exposure to warmer river temperatures. We suggest that such watershed-scale compensatory mechanisms may be critical to the long-term sustainability of Pacific salmon, given expected changes in climate. However, such compensation will probably only be applicable to some stocks and may be limited under extremely high temperatures where nonenergetic factors such as disease and stress may play a more dominant role in defining mortality. Our results further indicate that a long-term decline in the mean mass of adult sockeye salmon completing their marine residency could erode their migratory fitness during the river migration and hence jeopardize the sustainability of sockeye salmon and the fishery that targets them.

AB  - Mountain streams provide important habitats for many species, but their faunas are especially vulnerable to climate change because of ectothermic physiologies and movements that are constrained to linear networks that are easily fragmented. Effectively conserving biodiversity in these systems requires accurate downscaling of climatic trends to local habitat conditions, but downscaling is difficult in complex terrains given diverse microclimates and mediation of stream heat budgets by local conditions. We compiled a stream temperature database (n = 780) for a 2500-km river network in central Idaho to assess possible trends in summer temperatures and thermal habitat for two native salmonid species from 1993 to 2006. New spatial statistical models that account for network topology were parameterized with these data and explained 93% and 86% of the variation in mean stream temperatures and maximas, respectively. During our study period, basin average mean stream temperatures increased by 0.38°C (0.27°C/decade), and maximas increased by 0.48°C (0.34°C/decade), primarily due to long-term (30–50 year) trends in air temperatures and stream flows. Radiation increases from wildfires accounted for 9% of basin-scale temperature increases, despite burning 14% of the basin. Within wildfire perimeters, however, stream temperature increases were 2–3 times greater than basin averages, and radiation gains accounted for 50% of warming. Thermal habitat for rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) was minimally affected by temperature increases, except for small shifts towards higher elevations. Bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus), in contrast, were estimated to have lost 11–20% (8–16%/decade) of the headwater stream lengths that were cold enough for spawning and early juvenile rearing, with the largest losses occurring in the coldest habitats. Our results suggest that a warming climate has begun to affect thermal conditions in streams and that impacts to biota will be specific to both species and context. Where species are at risk, conservation actions should be guided based on considerations of restoration opportunity and future climatic effects. To refine predictions based on thermal effects, more work is needed to understand mechanisms associated with biological responses, climate effects on other habitat features, and habitat configurations that confer population resilience.

AB  - Aquatic ecologists are working to develop theory and techniques for analysis of dynamic stream processes and communities of organisms. Such work is critical for the development of conservation plans that are relevant at the scale of entire ecosystems. The stream network is the foundation upon which stream systems are organized. Natural and human disturbances in streams alter the configuration of stream habitats such as pools, riffles, and glides across seasons, decades, or centuries. Thus, native aquatic species have developed mechanisms for adapting to the dynamic configuration of habitats in stream networks. At different spatial scales, stream network structure informs habitat connectivity for aquatic–obligate species. The movement of aquatic species both upstream and downstream is limited by stream channels and may be modified by the downstream flow of water, nutrients, and physical materials such as wood and substrate. Analysing streams as networks offers a realistic and holistic perspective for assessing movement and distribution by freshwater aquatic species in response to life-history needs and environmental conditions. In this study, network analysis was facilitated by automating, in a Geographic Information System, the calculation of network distances and variables that represent spatial configuration. A comparison between traditional instream habitat variables and network variables for juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) in seven sub-basins of Oregon's mid-coast over a 5-year period revealed that network variables perform better at explaining juvenile coho salmon density than instream habitat variables. Moreover, analysis of network distances among seasonal habitats indicates that juvenile coho salmon density may be higher where the distance between critical seasonal habitats is short. This work furthers aquatic conservation, management, and restoration by including analysis of the proximity and connectivity among aquatic freshwater habitats. Published in 2012.

AB  - Modeling sediment transport through large basins presents a challenging problem. The relation between water flux and sediment load is complex, and substantial erosion and transport can occur over small spatial and temporal scales. Analysis of large-scale basins often relies on lumped empirical models that do not consider spatial or subannual variability. In this study, we adapt a small-scale, mechanistic, distributed suspended sediment transport model for application to large basins. The model is integrated into the Terrestrial Hydrology Model with Biochemistry to make use of the Terrestrial Hydrology Model with Biochemistry's dynamic water routing. The coupled model is applied to the 230,000-km2 Fraser River Basin in British Columbia, Canada, using climatic and hydrological inputs provided by a historical run of the Variable Infiltration Capacity model. Hourly simulations are aggregated into monthly and long-term averages which are compared against observations. Simulated long-term lake sedimentation values are within an order of magnitude of observations, and monthly load simulations have an average R2 of 0.70 across the five study stations with available data. Model results indicate that sediment loads from tributaries do not heavily influence dynamics along the main stem and suggest the importance of network connectivity. Sensitivity analysis indicates that models may benefit from characterizing bed load irrespective of its contribution to total sediment load. Historical simulations over the 1965–2004 period reveal important changes in sediment dynamics that could not be captured with a lumped model, including a decrease in basin sediment load interannual variability driven by changes in runoff and load variability within a key subbasin.

AB  - Adult sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka destined for the Fraser River, British Columbia are some of the most economically important populations but changes in the timing of their homeward migration have led to management challenges and conservation concerns. After a directed migration from the open ocean to the coast, this group historically would mill just off shore for 3–6 weeks prior to migrating up the Fraser River. This milling behaviour changed abruptly in 1995 and thereafter, decreasing to only a few days in some years (termed early migration), with dramatic consequences that have necessitated risk-averse management strategies. Early migrating fish consistently suffer extremely high mortality (exceeding 90% in some years) during freshwater migration and on spawning grounds prior to spawning. This synthesis examines multidisciplinary, collaborative research aimed at understanding what triggers early migration, why it results in high mortality, and how fisheries managers can utilize these scientific results. Tissue analyses from thousands of O. nerka captured along their migration trajectory from ocean to spawning grounds, including hundreds that were tracked with biotelemetry, have revealed that early migrants are more reproductively advanced and ill-prepared for osmoregulatory transition upon their entry into fresh water. Gene array profiles indicate that many early migrants are also immunocompromised and stressed, carrying a genomic profile consistent with a viral infection. The causes of these physiological changes are still under investigation. Early migration brings O. nerka into the river when it is 3–6° C warmer than historical norms, which for some late-run populations approaches or exceeds their critical maxima leading to the collapse of metabolic and cardiac scope, and mortality. As peak spawning dates have not changed, the surviving early migrants tend to mill in warm lakes near to spawning areas. These results in the accumulation of many more thermal units and longer exposures to freshwater diseases and parasites compared to fish that delay freshwater entry by milling in the cool ocean environment. Experiments have confirmed that thermally driven processes are a primary cause of mortality for early-entry migrants. The Fraser River late-run O. nerka early migration phenomenon illustrates the complex links that exist between salmonid physiology, behaviour and environment and the pivotal role that water temperature can have on population-specific migration survival.

TY  - report
AU  - N.D. Schubert
SN  - 2737
AB  - The Department of Fisheries and Oceans conducts annual assessments of the abundance of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations on the spawning grounds. Large populations (25,000+) are assessed using enumeration fences or mark-recapture studies, while small populations (less than 25,000) are assessed using visual techniques. In 1995, study techniques included mark-recapture, enumeration fences, counts in artificial spawning channels and visual surveys. The escapement totalled 1,736,763 adults and 18,473 jacks distributed over 121 populations in ten geographic areas and four run timing groups. The proportion that was estimated by each study type is 67% by mark-recapture projects, 15% at enumeration fences, 4% at spawning channels and 14% by visual surveys. Significant improvements to mark-recapture study designs were implemented in 1995 following a thorough review in 1994. Operational and analytic changes focused primarily on the mark-recapture studies and included: promoting the mixing of tags and the unbiased recovery of carcasses by allocating tag applica-tion and recovery effort more representatively across spatial and temporal strata; assessing tag loss by applying an opercular punch as a secondary mark; improving the resurveys for missed tags; minimizing handling stress by the use of new techniques; and adopting a more structured approach to the assessment of sampling bias and to identify whether the use of the pooled Petersen or the maximum likelihood Darroch estimator is most appropriate. On the basis of the 1995 results, further changes are identified to address issues related to the identification of tag status, the assessment of tag loss, proportional sampling, and the appropriate population estimator.

AB  - Late-spawning Fraser River sockeye salmon, O. nerka, stocks have suffered significant pre-spawn mortality associated with an unusually early freshwater migration pattern and the myxosporean parasite, P. minibicornis. Surveys of migrating adult salmon from several spawning populations were conducted in 1999 and 2000 to determine the extent of infection with P. minibicornis, when and where the parasite first became detectable during migration, and whether early migrating stocks might be used as sentinels to assess risk of infection in late-spawning stocks. Posterior kidney, preserved in 95% ethanol, was examined for P. minibicornis in stained histological sections and using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. The prevalence of this parasite in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks examined was high (range 47-100% infected). In contrast, P. minibicornis was not detected in the fish tested from the 2 sockeye salmon stocks outside the Fraser River drainage in either 1999 or 2000. The parasite was also not detected histologically or by PCR in the kidney tissue of the fish from the Fraser River that were sampled in salt water or early during their freshwater migration up the river. These findings and the progression in the prevalence and intensity of infection as the fish from 3 stocks (early Stuart, Weaver Creek and Cultus Lake) were monitored over time, suggest that the salmon acquired the parasite either in the lower Strait of Georgia or in the lower Fraser River before the confluence of the Harrison River. In both 1999 and 2000, the parasite was present in all Fraser River sockeye salmon stocks sampled, which suggests that early Stuart salmon may be valuable as a sentinel stock for the presence of the parasite in later-spawning stocks.

AB  - Sediment size and supply exert a dominant control on channel structure. We review the role of sediment supply in channel structure, and how regional differences in sediment supply and landuse affect stream restoration priorities. We show how stream restoration goals are best understood within a common fluvial geomorphology framework defined by sediment supply, storage, and transport. Landuse impacts in geologically young landscapes with high sediment yields (e.g., coastal British Columbia) typically result in loss of instream wood and accelerated sediment inputs from bank erosion, logging roads, hillslopes and gullies. In contrast, northern Sweden and Finland are landscapes with naturally low sediment yields caused by low relief, resistant bedrock, and abundant mainstem lakes that act as sediment traps. Landuse impacts involved extensive channel narrowing, removal of obstructions, and bank armouring with boulders to facilitate timber floating, thereby reducing sediment supply from bank erosion while increasing export through higher channel velocities. These contrasting landuse impacts have pushed stream channels in opposite directions (aggradation versus degradation) within a phase-space defined by sediment transport and supply. Restoration in coastal British Columbia has focused on reducing sediment supply (through bank and hillslope stabilization) and restoring wood inputs. In contrast, restoration in northern Fennoscandia (Sweden and Finland) has focused on channel widening and removal of bank-armouring boulders to increase sediment supply and retention. These contrasting restoration priorities illustrate the consequences of divergent regional landuse impacts on sediment supply, and the utility of planning restoration activities within a mechanistic sediment supply-transport framework.

AB  - Eggs of ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) were collected over the period 1991 to 1997 at 111 nests in the Fraser and Columbia River drainage systems of British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. Contents were analyzed for organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and total mercury. Blood samples were taken from nestling ospreys at two time points during the 1992 breeding season on the Thompson River and analyzed for non-ortho PCBs. Concentrations of DDE and related compounds showed high variability among individual eggs within study areas and no significant differences in mean concentrations among study areas. Some eggs contained high concentrations of DDE, up to 20 mg/kg (wet weight), for which there were no evident local sources, suggesting that exposure occurred outside of the breeding grounds. Most other OC pesticides measured in osprey eggs showed a similar distribution, although mean concentrations of chlordane-related compounds were generally, and in some cases significantly, higher in samples collected from the Columbia River sites compared to elsewhere. Significantly greater concentrations of PCBs were found in eggs from the Columbia River basin compared to the Fraser. This was attributed to extensive development of hydroelectric generation and related industries on the Columbia system. Significant differences among sites were also found in the pattern of PCB congeners, e.g., eggs from the lower Columbia River site had proportionally greater concentrations of less chlorinated, Aroclor 1242–type PCBs compared to other sites. In contrast, eggs from upper reaches of the Columbia River had relatively greater amounts of Aroclor 1254 and 1260 congeners. Mercury concentrations in osprey eggs tended to be uniform among sites and comparable to those reported in the literature for ospreys nesting on naturally formed lakes and rivers. There were no significant temporal changes in mean concentrations of any of the measured compounds at sites monitored from 1991 to 1997.

Chlorinated dioxins and furans, chlorophenolics, resin acids, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and 4-nonylphenol were generally measured in higher concentrations downstream of pulp mills and urban centres relative to upstream locations. In areas impacted by urban runoff, organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls were elevated relative to reference locations. While most metals were found to be naturally high in sediments throughout the Fraser basin, elevated levels of some metals, such as arsenic, may originate from anthropogenic sources.

AB  - Although the importance of diversity to maintaining metapopulation stability is widely recognized, the ecological characteristics that lead to synchronous dynamics within population aggregates are often unclear. We used a constrained dynamic factor analysis to explore patterns of covariance in productivity among 16 Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) conservation units (CUs). Specifically, we tested whether coherent trends in productivity covaried with five distinct ecological attributes: physical characteristics of nursery lakes, large-scale management interventions, genetic similarity, adult migration phenology, or juvenile migratory traits. The top-ranked model had two trends based on nursery lake characteristics and juvenile migratory traits. One trend represented the dynamics of CUs that rear in nursery lakes prior to ocean entry and undergo relatively rapid marine migrations. The second included a sea-type CU, Harrison River, which enters the marine environment without rearing in a nursery lake and migrates more slowly. The uniform response of lake-type CUs, as well as Harrison River CU’s unique life history, suggests that coherent trends are structured by traits that covary with broad life history type, rather than fine-scale characteristics. Furthermore, we document substantial temporal variability in the strength of synchronous dynamics among Fraser River CUs. Greater synchrony in recent years suggests that the importance of shared regional drivers, relative to local processes, may have increased.

AB  - The Burns and Decker Lakes watershed is located on the Nechako plateau in North-Central British Columbia. The lakes are relatively shallow, very productive, and have naturally high concentrations of phosphorus. In recent years, many watershed residents have observed increased algal and macrophyte production and a shift in fish species distribution. These are typical characteristics of lakes undergoing eutrophication. Studies suggest that land use activities in many parts of the watershed may be contributing to the water quality and eutrophication concerns in Burns and Decker lakes. The overall goal of the lake management planning process is to create a recipe “to enhance and preserve the quality and health of the Burns and Decker Lakes watershed”. This management plan marks the end of the first iteration of the process, and is intended to provide long-term direction to the Lakes District Watershed Enhancement Society as it undertakes projects to improve the quality of the watershed. To date, the planning process has opened communication links between numerous stakeholders, and has created a local awareness of lake management and watershed health.

AB  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale habitat alteration by stand thinning would reduce red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) populations and feeding damage in young lodgepole pine (Finns contorta) forest. An additional objective included integration of stand protection with an optimum thinning regime for growth rates of crop trees. Study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of approximate to 500 (low), 1000 (medium), and 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned/juvenile Fine stand and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Squirrel populations were sampled intensively in the thinned stands from 1989 to 1991; feeding damage was assessed annually from 1989 to 1993. Five-year diameter and height increments of crop trees were measured in the thinned stands at Penticton and Prince George, and 4-yr increments in these stands at Kamloops. Red squirrel populations were significantly reduced in the low-density stand compared with either the medium- or high-density stands at Penticton and Prince George. Squirrels were less abundant in both the low- and medium-density stands at Kamloops. Squirrel populations in the unthinned and old-growth stands were similar or lower in abundance than those in the thinned stands. There were significantly higher numbers of red squirrel first captures in the medium- and high-density stands than in the low-density stand. There were no consistent significant differences between stands in proportion of squirrels breeding, recruitment, mean survival over summer and winter periods, or mean body mass. More tries per hectare were damaged in the high than in either low- or medium-density stands at all study areas. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than there in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Trees grew significantly faster in height in the high- than in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George; the converse was true at Kamloops. Manipulation of stand density on an operational basis in young lodgepole pine has clearly indicated that both stand protection from squirrel feeding damage and productivity of crop trees are enhanced by reducing the number of stems per hectare. This result has been achieved in replicated study areas covering three different forest ecological zones.

Four stands were aerially sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Defoliation and mortality levels were elevated in non-sprayed stands. The relationship between defoliation and survival-times was captured in a Cox proportional hazard model with a defoliation stress index (DSI), diameter (DBH), crown class (CCL), a random stand effect, Bt-treatment, and number of years of exposure to stand-level defoliation (DYEAR) as predictors. The DSI, optimized for discrimination between survivors and non-survivors, is the discounted sum of five lagged DF% values. Survival probabilities were predicted with a maximum error of 0.02. Hazard rates increased by 0.06 for every one point increase in DSI. CCL and random stand effects were highly significant. Bt-treatment effects were fully captured by DSI, CCL, and DYEAR.

AB  - With large expanses of open vegetation, airports serve as major attractants for numerous bird species, such as the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), which can lead to high risk of bird-aircraft collision. Previous observations of large influxes of crows at the Prince George Airport (British Columbia, Canada) in July and August suggested that crows were opportunistically foraging on grasshopper (Melanoplus sp.) population eruptions in mown grass during those months. We tested whether grasshoppers were more visible (i.e., easier for crows to detect) under different grass lengths, and whether crows were preferentially attracted to these same grass lengths. Employing line transects during July to August 2010 and 2011, we detected >6 times as many grasshoppers in short-cut grass (0 to 15 cm) than in uncut grass (>30 cm). Data from 2011 also revealed that grasshopper detections by crows was significantly higher in short-cut grass than in grass left at intermediate lengths (long-cut grass [15 to 30 cm]). Crow densities also varied with grass length, with significantly more crows foraging in short-cut than long-cut or uncut grass lengths. Our results indicate that allowing the grass to grow to >15 cm could reduce the attraction of crows to the airfield and may reduce bird-aircraft collisions.

AB  - Baculoviruses infect larval lepidopterans, and thus have potential value as microbial controls of agricultural and forest pests. Understanding their genetic relatedness and host specificity is relevant to the risk assessment of viral insecticides if non-target impacts are to be avoided. DNA polymerase gene sequences have been demonstrated to be useful for inferring genetic relatedness among dsDNA viruses. We have adopted this approach to examine the relatedness among natural isolates of two uncharacterized caterpillar-infecting baculoviruses, Malacosoma californicum pluviale nucleopolyhedrovirus (McplMNPV) and Malacosoma disstria nucleopolyhedrovirus (MadiMNPV), which infect two closely related host species with little to no cross-infectivity. We designed two degenerate primers (BVP1 and BVP2) based on protein motifs conserved among baculoviruses. McplMNPV and MadiMNPV viral DNA was obtained from naturally infected caterpillars collected from geographically distinct sites in the Southern Gulf Islands and Prince George regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sequencing of 0.9 kb PCR amplicons from six McplMNPV and six MadiMNPV isolates obtained from a total of eight sites, revealed very low nucleotide variation among McplMNPV isolates (99.2-100% nucleotide identity) and among MadiMNPV isolates (98.9-100% nucleotide identity). Greater nucleotide variation was observed between viral isolates from the two different caterpillar species (only 84.7-86.1% nucleotide identity). Both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses support placement of McplMNPV and MadiMNPV in a clade that is distinct from other groups of baculoviruses.

Darker), and sequoia pitch moth (Synanthedon sequoiae (Hy. Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool.

AB  - Two major Late Paleozoic-Triassic oceanic terranes are exposed in the North America Cordillera. Slide Mountain Terrane is made up of dolerites, pillow basalts associated with cumulate gabbros and peridotites ranging in age from Carboniferous to Permian. Cache Creek Terrane consists of tectonic slices of Paleozoic platform carbonates, undated cumulate gabbros intruded by dolerites, foliated ultramafic rocks and mafic volcanic rocks interbedded within Upper Triassic siliceous and volcaniclastic sediments. Among the Permian (Slide Mountain) and Upper Triassic (Cache Creek) volcanic rocks, four types have been distinguished. Type 1 is geochemically similar to N-MORB. Type 2 is mildly to highly enriched in LREE, Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and Th, and differs from Type 1 by lower epsilonNd and higher Pb isotopic ratios. It displays alkaline affinities. Types 3 and 4 occur only in the Cache Creek Terrane. Type 3 has flat REE patterns similar to oceanic plateau basalts and isotope compositions intermediate between Types 1 and 2. Type 4 is distinguished from Type 3 by convex REE patterns and higher Pb isotopic ratios. Cumulate peridotites and gabbros are LREE-depleted and their high epsilonNd suggest that they derived from the melting of a depleted MORB-type mantle source. The foliated ultramafic rocks are either serpentinized harzburgites (Trembleur ultramafics) or dunites, harburgites and minor lherzolites (Murray Ridge), which are, intruded by undeformed pyroxenite veins. The ultramafic rocks have very low contents of rare earth elements (REE) and incompatible elements, and U-shaped REE patterns. The pyroxene-bearing peridotites are distinguished from the Trembleur harzburgites by an absence of Nb negative anomalies and lower (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios. Slide Mountain and Cache Creek Terranes formed in different tectonic settings. Slide Mountain basin, fringing the North American margin, was probably floored by oceanic crust locally thickened by oceanic island magmas. Indeed, in the Slide Mountain Terrane, N-MORB type basalts predominate and are associated with minor alkaline volcanic rocks within the same thrust sheet. Correlations between incompatible elements and values of the epsilonNd of the Slide Mountain rocks suggest that the N-MORB-type basalts and alkaline rocks are genetically linked. N-MORB type basalts and alkaline volcanic rocks could derive from the mixing of depleted MORB-type and enriched Oceanic island Basalt-type mantle sources. The Cache Creek Terrane may represent remnants of a Late Triassic oceanic plateau because plume-related volcanic rocks predominate while N-MORB type rocks are represented solely by cumulate gabbros and sheeted dykes. The Murray Ridge peridotites could represent the roots of the oceanic plateau. We conclude that the Slide Mountain and Cache Creek Terranes contributed to the growth of the North American continent as when they were accreted to the craton during the Early Triassic and Jurassic times.

AB  - Ice jams can sometimes occur in high latitude rivers during winter and the resulting water level rise may generate costly and dangerous flooding such as the recent ice jam flooding in the Nechako River in downtown Prince George in Canada. Thus, the forecast of water level and ice jam thickness is of great importance. This study compares three methods to simulate and forecast water level and ice jam thickness based on field observations of river ice jams in the Quyu Reach of the Yellow River in China. More specifically, simulation results generated by the traditional multi-variant regressional method are compared to those of the back propagation neural network and the support vector machine methods. The forecast of ice jam thickness and water level under ice jammed condition have been conducted in two different approaches, 1) simulation of water level and ice jam thickness in the second half of the period of measurement using models developed based on data gained during the first half of the period of measurement, 2) simulation of water level and ice jam thickness at the downstream cross sections using models developed based on data gained at the upstream cross sections. For this reason, as the results of simulation and field observations indicated, the back propagation neural network method and the support vector machine method are superior in terms of accuracy to the multi-variant regressional method.

AB  - Seed orchards for the production of conifer seed in British Columbia are usually located in areas favorable (warm and dry) for flowering and seed development, often considerably south of the source location of the parent trees. Differences in environmental conditions between seed orchard location and location of origin can affect progeny performance. It is suspected that this is caused by environmental factors that affect reproductive processes of parent trees and lead to altered physiological traits (aftereffects). This study examined if aftereffects are present in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Control pollinations were made at two locations, Red Rock, near Prince George (53 degrees N) in central British Columbia, and Kalamalka, near Vernon (50 degrees N) in southern British Columbia, on five female trees using a four-male polymix. Identical genotypes through grafting were present at the two locations. Pollen maturing at each site was only used in the polymix at that particular location. Progeny were raised and germination traits, number of needle primordia, greenhouse and field heights, and frost hardiness were evaluated in a common environment. The location of seed development significantly affected all traits evaluated. Height growth aftereffects in the second field season were much less than those observed in the first field season. These results suggest that aftereffects are detectable in white spruce progeny performance in British Columbia.

AB  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide (glyphosate, active ingredient) application for conifer release would reduce species diversity (measured as richness, Simpson's index, and Shannon-Wiener index) of both plant and small mammal communities over a 5-year period in young sub-boreal spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm, x Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) forest. Four treated and four untreated (control) sites were studied near Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada. Crown volume index of shrub vegetation was reduced by herbicide application. Species richness of shrubs was reduced in the first year after treatment and remained lower on treated sites throughout the 5-year period. Both indices of shrub diversity, however, were not different over the 5 years. Herbicide treatment initially reduced crown volume index of herbaceous vegetation, but values quickly recovered to untreated levels by the second year after treatment. Herbaceous species diversity was not affected by herbicide treatment. Diversity of small mammal communities apparently was not affected by herbicide application. In general, diversity of plant and small mammal communities seemed to be maintained, and hence, these treatment sites may not lower overall diversity of a forested landscape. Silvicultural practices, such as conifer release with herbicides or alternative methods, may contribute to a diversity of stand structures and wildlife habitats if appropriately designed and implemented.

AB  - 1. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide-induced habitat alteration would reduce snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus) populations in early- to mid-successional (<25 years post-treatment) stages of sub-boreal spruce forest. 2. Intensive population sampling and monitoring of vegetation were conducted in replicate control and treatment blocks near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada from 1988 to 1991. Index line surveys of hares also were conducted in 10 paired control-treatment blocks. 3. Herb biomass and cover recovered to control values by 2-3 years post-treatment. Shrub and tree biomass and cover were little affected in a 'conifer release' treatment where coniferous species dominated these layers. In a 'backlog conversion' treatment, the dominant deciduous trees and shrubs were relatively slow to recover. 4. Herbicide-induced habitat alteration in optimum habitat seemed not to affect abundance of snowshoe hares during summer and autumn. 5. Post-harvest forest habitats 10-20 years of age may have sufficient and persistent vegetative structure, particularly those with a high component of coniferous species, to support hare populations regardless of herbicide treatment.

AB  - This study assessed the impact of feeding injuries by snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben) and red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben) on diameter growth, height growth, and wood quality of juvenile lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var latifolia Engelm.) at Prince George and in the Cariboo Region, British Columbia. In the Prince George control stand, severe girdling damage (50-99% stem circumference) suppressed diameter and height growth of small-diameter (4.1-6.0 cm) trees, but had no effect on larger stems (6.1-8.0 cm). In the spaced stand, diameter and height increments also declined significantly with degree of partial girdling, particularly in small-diameter (3.1-5.0 cm) trees. Paradoxically, diameter increment increased significantly with degree of partial girdling in both stands at the Cariboo study area. Presumably squirrels prefer to feed on vigorous stems, and the lost growth of these trees may be substantial. There was no significant difference in amount of compression wood nor total solvent and water extractives between undamaged and damaged trees. Fiber lengths in wound-associated wood were consistently 19-21% lower than in controls. Damaged trees had greater average ring width and density than undamaged trees. The average increase in relative density of damaged over undamaged trees was 0.0343. These results suggest that a severe degree of partial girdling (which likely occurs more often in small-diameter trees) may significantly affect growth of lodgepole pine, particularly small (<5.0 cm DBH) trees.

AB  - Geographic variation in song may arise to facilitate assortative mating among locally adapted individuals or to increase ability to communicate within local neighbourhoods. Alternatively, geographic song variation may be functionally neutral, emerging as a by-product of idiosyncrasies of founder effects and song learning in peripheral populations. We studied differences in the terminal notes of songs in White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) in a peripheral population found west of the Rocky Mountains. Unlike the common triplet of notes found in terminal strophes of the main distribution of this species in eastern North America, birds in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, had terminal notes composed of doublets. We mapped song variation on an east-west transect through central Alberta, Canada, but were unable to find a sharp division between areas where the terminal notes shift; instead, we found evidence of a cline of increasing frequency of doublet endings from east to west. We performed playback experiments of local versus foreign song types in populations where doublet terminal strophes (Prince George, BC) versus triplet terminal strophes (Algonquin Park, ON) predominate. We found a significant difference between the populations, with the western birds responding more strongly overall than the eastern birds, and males in both populations responding more strongly to the doublet-ending song type. Our results do not support the origination of regional variation to discriminate among local populations, but are consistent with neutral cultural shifts.

AB  - Purpose. To identify, from the perspectives of people with spinal cord injury (SCI), (a) appropriate components of a fatigue management programme; and (b) important outcomes or indicators of success. Method. Collaborative, qualitative methodology comprising four focus groups undertaken simultaneously in Kelowna, Prince George, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Participants included a purposive sample of 21 men and women with complete and incomplete SCI of high and low tetraplegia and paraplegia. Two family members, two care-providing assistants and four occupational therapists provided additional information (total n = 29). Interpretive data analysis identified common themes addressing each research question. Results. Building on those strategies they perceived to facilitate coping with fatigue, the participants identified 10 components of a helpful fatigue management programme. Dimensions of 'successful' outcomes from such a programme reflected quality of life concerns: enabling people with SCI to do the things they value, enhancing their sense of control over their lives, reducing pain and helplessness, increasing motivation and enhancing relationships strained by fatigue. Conclusions. This study identifies many of the necessary elements of a fatigue management programme to meet the specific needs of people with SCI; and ascertains important indicators of a successful programme from the perspectives of those who must live with the outcomes.

AB  - Objective To determine whether menstrual cups are a viable alternative to tampons. Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Prince George, Victoria, and Vancouver, BC. Participants A total of 110 women aged 19 to 40 years who had previously used tampons as their main method of menstrual management. Intervention Participants were randomized into 2 groups, a tampon group and a menstrual cup group. Using online diaries, participants tracked 1 menstrual cycle using their regular method and 3 menstrual cycles using the method of their allocated group. Main outcome measures Overall satisfaction; secondary outcomes included discomfort, urovaginal infection, cost, and waste. Results Forty-seven women in each group completed the final survey, 5 of whom were subsequently excluded from analysis (3 from the tampon group and 2 from the menstrual cup group). Overall satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale was higher for the menstrual cup group than for the tampon group (mean [standard deviation] score 5.4 [1.5] vs 5.0 [1.0], respectively; P = .04). Approximately 91% of women in the menstrual cup group said they would continue to use the cup and recommend it to others. Women used a median of 13 menstrual products per cycle, or 169 products per year, which corresponds to approximately 771 248 400 products used annually in Canada. Estimated cost for tampon use was $37.44 a year (similar to the retail cost of 1 menstrual cup). Subjective vaginal discomfort was initially higher in the menstrual cup group, but the discomfort decreased with continued use. There was no significant difference in physician-diagnosed urovaginal symptoms between the 2 groups. Conclusion Both of the menstrual management methods evaluated were well tolerated by subjects. Menstrual cups are a satisfactory alternative to tampons and have the potential to be a sustainable solution to menstrual management, with moderate cost savings and much-reduced environmental effects compared with tampons.

AB  - Perception of risk or subjective risk is playing an increasingly important role in risk assessment. This paper describes a study that investigated perceptions of climate change risk to forest ecosystems and forest-based communities among a sample of Canadian forestry experts. Data were collected by questionnaire from participants at a climate change and forestry workshop, sponsored by the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research Network Forest Sector and the McGregor Model Forest held in Prince George, British Columbia in February 2003. These forestry experts were somewhat concerned about the impacts of climate change, and they appeared unlikely to oppose strategies for preparing for and adapting to climate change. The respondents felt that the effects of climate change on forests and forest-based communities are not well understood by the general public or forest managers. They also felt that there is a relatively high level of uncertainty about the effects of climate change, especially with respect to forest-based communities. These results have important implications, including reinforcement of the need for greater awareness of climate change risks and for increased research and monitoring effort targeted at reducing levels of uncertainty about future impacts at local scales.

AB  - A 524-km reach of Fraser River, British Columbia, was traversed, where the channel alternates between gravel-bedded reaches that are incised into semiconsolidated glacial deposits and bedrock-bound reaches, including Fraser Canyon. Continuous centerline acoustic Doppler current profiler survey and observations of bedrock confinement, supplemented with measurements on air photos, reveal the influence of bedrock on channel properties. The surveyed reach was subdivided into 10 morphological reaches, ranging from dominance by alluvial gravel-bed channels to dominantly rock-walled canyons. Measured data were grouped within each reach based on the presence of bedrock on both banks, one bank, or neither bank. From alluvial to mixed to canyon-dominated reaches, river widths decreased while water depths, flow velocities, water surface slopes, and bed shear stresses increased. Within reaches, subreaches with bedrock on both banks were narrower and deeper with higher bed shear stresses but, at the observed stage, had lower depth-averaged velocity and water surface slope than partly confined and alluvial (unconfined) subreaches. A conceptual model is presented representing a bedrock river as an alternating series of relatively low gradient, deep, rock-walled pools and steep semialluvial or alluvial sections. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations have scaling exponents expected for alluvial channels provided that the alluvial and rock-influenced sections are analyzed separately. In Fraser River, canyons become relatively narrower downstream, apparently in response to increasing rock uplift during the Quaternary period. The observations are compared against prior semitheoretical frameworks established to explain variations in width, slope, and channel shape along rockbound channels. Plain Language Summary Using data derived from a 524-km traverse of the canyon-infested Fraser River, British Columbia, we learned that the rock-walled canyons, which occupy only 16% of the total distance, are steeper and narrower than the rest of the river but, surprisingly, have lower water velocity and lower slope. So how do the canyons manage to transport all the sediment fed into them and remain rockbound? They maintain higher sediment mobilizing forces on the bed because the maximum flow velocity plunges to near the bed as the flow is squeezed into the narrow canyon. Despite this effect, the canyons maintain the overall scaling relations for width, depth, and flow expected in rivers that are not rockbound. We also detected an effect of recent rock uplift whereby the reaches subject to greater uplift are relatively narrower as the river focuses all erosive energy on downcutting to maintain its course over the uplifted reach.

AB  - For decades the literature on the winter cities and on urban design has explored the implications of poorly designed urban spaces on pedestrian mobility during various seasons. In Canada, however, practice in using climate responsive design principles tends to be the exception. Using a case study methodology, this paper explores the application of climate responsive design principles in the commercial redevelopment process in Prince George, British Columbia. Findings indicate that, despite expressed interest in winter city development, professionals and decision makers involved in the development permit process do not possess sufficient knowledge about climate responsive design to apply these principles to everyday practice. More importantly, knowledge about climate responsive design did not appear to be a major consideration in creating or evaluating commercial redevelopment projects. A range of educational, attitudinal, regulatory, structural, and political barriers impede the development of an institutional framework to support the implementation of climate responsive design.

However, nothing is known about viral infection in populations of forest caterpillars that declined to low density. We used DNA dot-blot hybridization to identify viral infection in caterpillars collected from 6 field populations of forest tent caterpillars in the vicinity of Prince George, BC. Over the 5 yr of observations, populations at 4 sites declined from high to low densities. Viral infection was generally highest among caterpillars from dense and declining populations but persisted at low levels in sparse populations. Populations at 2 sites which erupted in the last 2 yr of the study had levels of infection comparable to populations which were at high density at the beginning of the study.

AB  - Seven Landsdt images near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, representing a range of within-year and between-year dates, were acquired to assess spectral variability and the concomitant impact upon hyperclustering classification results. Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure.

AB  - Introduction: Equitable recruitment strategies, designed to ensure improved opportunities to participate in the research, are needed to include First Nations (FN) communities. The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities.

AB  - West of Prince George, British Columbia, the Cache Creek Terrane is composed of mafic lavas interlayered with both mid-Permian pelagic limestones and Upper Triassic siliceous shales and greywackes. Gabbro, basalt, dolerites, and foliated clinopyroxene-rich ultramafic rocks are exposed within the Pinchi Fault system. The mid-Permian lavas show affinities of oceanic island tholeiites. Among the Triassic lavas, three types of rocks have been distinguished. Type 1 is geochemically similar to the mid-Permian volcanic rocks. Type 2 differs from type 1 by higher TiO2 abundances and convex rare earth element patterns. Type 3 has the highest Zr, Nb, and Ta abundances and the greatest light rare earth element enrichment. The mafic rocks within the Pinchi Fault system are similar to N-type mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB), and the foliated ultramafic rocks are characterized by very low trace element contents, similar to extremely depleted harzburgites. Permian lavas and Triassic type 1 and igneous rocks from the Pinchi Fault system have the highest epsilon(Nd(i)) ratios (+7.4 to +9.6) and those of type 3 alkali have the lowest ratios (+2.0 to +5.3). The epsilon(Nd(i)) values of type 2 are intermediate between those of type 1 (similar to +7) and type 3 (similar to +4.9). This suggests that the Triassic rocks generated from a heterogeneous plume source or the mixing between depleted N-MORB and enriched oceanic island basalt sources. If the mafic igneous rocks sampled in central British Columbia are representative of the preserved parts of an oceanic crust, within the Cache Creek Terrane, then that crust was dominated by oceanic plateau components, perhaps due to the difficulty of subducting thick crust.

AB  - Structures associated with dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault are characterized predominantly by subvertical to vertical faults. Intersections of the fault planes with planar fabrics are all subvertical. This geometry, together with the common occurrence of subhorizontal slickenlines and stretching lineations in some strongly deformed fault zones, indicates their strike-slip nature. Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. Regional cleavage within the fault-bounded blocks indicates that the blocks were nonuniformly rotated clockwise about subvertical axes in response to progressive dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault. The mode of deformation observed in the area may characterize many parts of the Intermontane Belt.

AB  - A number of change mapping methods are being evaluated as part of a national program for monitoring Canada's forest cover, change and biomass (Earth Observation for Sustainable Development - EOSD). One approach being evaluated involves a simple two date multispectral unsupervised classification approach to map forest change at a national scale with Landsat data. Key factors are the types and consistency of change classes that emerge from the clustering algorithms and issues related to labelling these into desired change classes. The technique was investigated using two sites. Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada used 1990 and 1999 imagery. The second site of Petawawa in eastern Ontario, has fifteen images from a time period from 1984 to 2001 that were normalized and then analyzed in various image pairs. Utilizing the six visible and infrared Landsat bands from each of two dates in a K-means hyperclustering, classes of conifer, hardwood and mixedwood that had not changed were separated. Before any amalgamation, many clusters were associated with change, especially changes in vegetation on old cuts and open fields. Post-clearing ground vegetation density and type had a moderate influence on the clustering process. Pre-clearing forest type was only a factor in general terms, for example whether it was hardwood, softwood or mixedwood. Clearcuts often had several clusters associated with them, but were well detected when clusters were amalgamated. Partial cuts were only partly detected. The length of time after the cut was an important consideration in their detection. They were detectable for only 2 or 3 years after the cutting. The above approach is expected to be one of several tools used in the EOSD initiative.

AB  - Simulated browsing treatments were imposed on an important browse species of the North American moose (Alces alces L.) to see if the development and extent of subsequent stem dieback in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) could be used to determine the time of browsing during the growing season. Two hundred naturally growing aspen saplings of similar size and form were randomly selected in a 20-ha area near the endowment lands of the University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Plants were randomly assigned to treatment categories so that the apical meristems of 50 plants each were assigned to a control or were clipped on one of the following dates 6 weeks apart: 1 June, 16 July, and 30 August 2005. The leader of each aspen was clipped and dieback was left to progress until the onset of winter dormancy. Our results showed that the earlier the simulated browsing occurs in the growing season, the greater the length of stem dieback, up to the maximum of the subapical axillary node below the point of clipping. The average rate at which dieback progressed varied between treatments and decreased throughout the growing season. Our results suggest that the ratio of the actual length of stem dieback to the overall length of stem between the clip point and the subapical axillary node serves as a good indicator for estimating the time at which aspen meristems have been browsed during the growing season.

AB  - Light interception by vegetation canopies surrounding white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) was studied for four different vegetation complexes on two sites near Prince George, British Columbia. Measurements of canopy percent cover and height, and canopy proximity to the tree, were combined to provide an index that could predict light interception by the canopy. Rates of foliage development of the different vegetation canopies studied had a significant effect on their degree of light interception over the growing season. Canopies dominated by fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.) developed foliage at a faster rate than canopies dominated by other species, especially those dominated by thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus Nutt.). Understanding the light interception characteristics of different vegetation canopies along with crop tree light requirements should allow the use of the light interception index for assessing the severity of competition for light in young plantations.

AB  - Terrestrial gastropod faunas of vast areas of northern and central British Columbia are extremely poorly known. I record new distributional records of Punctum randolphii (Dall, 1895), Microphysula cookei (Pilsbry, 1922), Pristiloma arcticum (Lehnert, 1884), Vertigo columbiana (Pilsbry & Vanatta, 1900) and other land snails from the Babine and Bulkley Ranges, Nechako Plateau, and Boundary Range of northwestern British Columbia. Records of Punctum randolphii and Vertigo columbiana are the first higher elevation localities in British Columbia. Pristiloma arcticum was collected from one site in the Babine Mountains and is newly recorded from the province. Microphysula cookei, previously known only from southern British Columbia and adjacent Washington, occurs north to the Babine and Hazelton Ranges, Nechako Plateau, and Boundary Range. While sharing many species in common, the mountain snail fauna differed from that of the adjacent Bulkley Valley by the inclusion of "coastal" and montane elements. Absent from the drier valley floor, Punctum randolphii, Microphysula cookei, Vertigo columbiana and Vespericola columbianus are considered coastal species whose distributions extend far inland along climatically favourable corridors.

AB  - Ground-motion time histories which are compatible with the uniform hazard spectra (UHS) provided by the new national seismic hazard maps of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) are simulated. Time histories are simulated for the following cities: Halifax, La Malbaie, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Prince George, Tofino, Vancouver, and Victoria. The target UHS for the time history simulations are the GSC 5% damped horizontal-component spectra for "firm ground" (Class B) sites for an annual probability of 1/500. The Canadian Council on Earthquake Engineering is currently considering the adoption of these maps as the seismological basis for the earthquake design requirements for future editions of the National Building Code of Canada. It is therefore useful to have compatible time histories for these spectra, in order that dynamic analysis methods requiring the use of time histories can be employed. The simulated records provide a realistic representation of ground motion for the earthquake magnitudes and distances that contribute most strongly to hazard at the selected cities and probability level. For each selected city, two horizontal components are generated for a moderate earthquake nearby, and two horizontal components are generated for a larger earthquake farther away. These records match the short- and long-period ends of the target UHS, respectively. These simulations for local and regional crustal earthquakes are based on a point-source stochastic simulation procedure. For cities in British Columbia, records are also simulated for a scenario M8.5 earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone, using a stochastic finite-fault simulation model. Four different rupture scenarios are considered. The ground motions for this scenario event are not associated with a specific probability level, but current information suggests that their probability of occurrence is comparable to that of the 1/500 UHS (the probabilistic analyses performed for the national hazard maps do not explicitly include the Cascadia subduction event). Thus it would be reasonable to conduct engineering analyses for cities in British Columbia using both the simulated crustal-event motions and the simulated Cascadia-event motions for the Cascadia event. The time histories simulated for this study are available free of charge to all interested parties.

AB  - Three species of closely related woodpeckers (sapsuckers; Sphyrapicus) hybridize where they come into contact, presenting a rare 'lambda-shape' meeting of hybrid zones. Two of the three arms of this hybrid zone are located on either side of the Interior Plateau of British Columbia, Canada bordering the foothills of the Coast Mountains and the Rocky Mountains. The third arm is located in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The zones of hybridization present high variability of phenotypes and alleles in relatively small areas and provide an opportunity to examine levels of reproductive isolation between the taxa involved. We examined phenotypes (morphometric traits and plumage) and genotypes of 175 live birds across the two hybrid zones. We used the Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) method to identify 180 partially diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to generate a genetic hybrid index (GHI) for each bird. Phenotypically diverged S. ruber and S. nuchalis are genetically closely related, while S. nuchalis and S. varius have similar plumage but are well separated at the genetic markers studied. The width of both hybrid zones is narrower than expected under neutrality, and analyses of both genotypes and phenotypes indicate that hybrids are rare in the hybrid zone. Rarity of hybrids indicates assortative mating and/or some form of fitness reduction in hybrids, which might maintain the species complex despite close genetic distance and introgression. These findings further support the treatment of the three taxa as distinct species.

AB  - The Quesnel River gold deposit (1.2 million tonnes grading 5.22 g/t Au in three separate zones) occurs within Takla Group volcanic rocks of Upper Triassic age proximal to an alkalic stock. The deposit occurs in amphibole-augite phyric, fragmental, basaltic rocks. Alteration has produced an assemblage of epidote-chlorite-tremolite-calcite-quartz with lesser pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, marcasite, galena, arsenopyrite and gold. The West Zone comprises a tabular, conformable sulfide body underlain by bedded, variably altered fragmental basaltic rocks and overlain by siltstone and argillite. In the Main Zone, highest gold grades occur adjacent to a sharp discordant alteration front with barren, strongly carbonatized, pyritic basaltic lapilli-tuff. It is overlain by siltstone and argillite and bounded to the east and a depth by a west dipping reverse fault. To the west the auriferous, propylitically altered, rocks grade laterally into lower grade and barren basaltic rocks. Oxygen (delta-O-18 = +9 to +15) and carbon (delta-O-13 = -14 to -7) isotopic signatures of calcite from carbonate-altered and propylitically altered rocks are similar. However, sulfur isotopic values for pyrite are different, with gold-associated pyrite (delta-S-34 = -7 to -3) distinct from pyrite in carbonate altered rocks with (delta-S-34 = +8 to +13). The carbonization occurred before complete induration of the basaltic fragmental rocks, whereas propylitization and gold plus sulfide precipitation is clearly epigenetic.

AB  - Many rural communities in British Columbia (western Canada) are at risk from wildfire. This risk will increase over time as a result of climate change because of higher average temperatures, longer growing seasons, and more intense droughts. On the other hand, these communities are also faced with rising fuel costs and a growing demand for heat as suburban population increases. The fact these communities are surrounded by forests presents an opportunity to combine community wildfire risk abatement with bioenergy development. Additional co-benefits include: (1) reduced community energy expenditures; (2) the creation of local jobs; (3) climate change mitigation; and (4) increased community energy security. Here, we present results from three pilot rural communities (Burns Lake, Invermere, and Sicamous, all of them in British Columbia) designed to evaluate the feasibility of wildfire risk abatement in conjunction with bioenergy production. Maps were created showing each community's forest-urban interface area with quantified estimates of its sustainable woody biomass resource potential under different management scenarios while monitoring ecosystem and soil health. The results and experience gained through this work has been synthesized in a calculator tool to help other communities make their own screening-level assessments.

AB  - Stratigraphy and structural styles vary greatly in two areas of the Coast Belt near Chilko Lake (Chilcotin Ranges in the east and Coast Mountains in the west). No definite continuity between the two belts has been established in the pre-mid-Cretaceous geology, but this area may be a long-lived, episodic magmatic are and nearby are-related basin. The stratigraphic contrasts may reflect inherent differences between an are and related basinal sequence. Triassic volcanic-are sequences are part of the Stikine (western belt) and Cadwallader (eastern belt) terranes, which may be part of the same are. The Jurassic is represented by one dated pluton in the west compared with almost continuous deposition of volcanogenic elastic rocks in the east. Lower Cretaceous sequences in the west and east may represent a volcanic are and back-are basin. The Taylor Creek Group (Albian) is the first definitive link between the two belts and represents an are and intra-are or back-are basin. The structural evolution of the two belts also differs significantly. The early Late Cretaceous Eastern Waddington thrust belt comprises all major structures in the west, but only has minor expression in the east. Most of the structures in the east are part of the latest Cretaceous(?) to early Tertiary dextral-strike-slip, Yalakom fault system. These differences were most likely caused by the Late Cretaceous change from nearly orthogonal subduction to a dextral-oblique convergent margin.

AB  - Network theory is applied to an array of stream-flow gauges located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (BC) and Yukon, Canada. The goal of the analysis is to assess whether insights from this branch of mathematical graph theory can be meaningfully applied to hydrometric data, and, more specifically, whether it may help guide decisions concerning stream gauge placement so that the full complexity of the regional hydrology is efficiently captured. The streamflow data, when represented as a complex network, have a global clustering coefficient and average shortest path length consistent with small-world networks, which are a class of stable and efficient networks common in nature, but the observed degree distribution did not clearly indicate a scale-free network. Stability helps ensure that the network is robust to the loss of nodes; in the context of a streamflow network, stability is interpreted as insensitivity to station removal at random. Community structure is also evident in the streamflow network. A network theoretic community detection algorithm identified separate communities, each of which appears to be defined by the combination of its median seasonal flow regime (pluvial, nival, hybrid, or glacial, which in this region in turn mainly reflects basin elevation) and geographic proximity to other communities (reflecting shared or different daily meteorological forcing). Furthermore, betweenness analyses suggest a handful of key stations which serve as bridges between communities and might be highly valued. We propose that an idealized sampling network should sample high-betweenness stations, small-membership communities which are by definition rare or undersampled relative to other communities, and index stations having large numbers of intracommunity links, while retaining some degree of redundancy to maintain network robustness.

AB  - In 1984, Paul Hanki of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, developed community mobile treatment, an innovative approach to substance abuse treatment in Native communities. The feature that distinguishes community mobile treatment from most other forms of treatment is the strong emphasis on community involvement. Before an actual treatment program is implemented, the community must acknowledge that a substance abuse problem exists and be committed and involved in addressing the problem. Once a community is mobilized, a 21 to 28 day intensive alcohol and drug treatment program for substance abusers and their families is brought into the community. Since ifs inception in 1984, community mobile treatment has been implemented in approximately 17 Canadian communities. The few evaluations that have been conducted suggest that this approach holds much promise in reducing alcohol and drug-related problems. This article reviews the existing documentation and provides a comprehensive description of this unique approach.

AB  - To be Indigenous within the modern nation-state is to live with a profound sense of territorial and temporal displacement. Colonial legal regimes situate indigeneity as a condition of temporal stasis, perpetuating the logic of territorial dispossession and erasure. Drawing on research in India and Canada, we focus on Indigenous experiences to theorize the relationship between colonial legal regimes, territory, temporality, and infrastructure. In the Indigenous territories of the Lepchas in the Indian Himalaya and the Dakelh in British Columbia, Canada, hydropower infrastructure effected displacements of Indigenous space-times and sovereignty. Although Indigenous peoples continue to assert legal claims challenging these massive infrastructural projects, colonial legal regimes normalize the often violent imposition of the space-times of state and capitalist development. The Dakelh have challenged the enduring impacts of a 1950s river diversion project; however, Canadian courts legitimized historic displacements, delimiting constitutional protections to current existing Dakelh rights. For the Lepchas, a recent infrastructural boom in the Indian Himalaya is threatening special constitutional provisions upholding tribal customary laws, raising concern among younger Lepchas over the future of their ancestral lands. Despite these threats, we demonstrate how Lepcha and Dakelh relations to time and territory exceed colonial containments. They call into question how the colonial present normalizes historic and ongoing displacements and demand responsibility for the past to craft alternative futures.

AB  - An extensive Fisheries Compensation Program has been undertaken at the Kemess Mine, located 10 kilometres east of Thutade Lake, in the northern Omineca Mountains of north central British Columbia. The minesite and study area are approximately 250 km north of Smithers, B.C. Annual fisheries monitoring programs were conducted during the predevelopment, construction and operation phases of the project and were critical in forming the basis of the compensation programs and later evaluation of program success. The fisheries compensation programs have achieved success in all aspects of the compensation. This paper will provide an overview of the efforts undertaken to accomplish the Compensation Programs, outline the challenges presented by the programs, and review their successes.

AB  - After forest harvesting, sites are initially sources of CO2, but eventually become sinks for CO2 after some period of years following reforestation. This period for boreal forests has been assumed to be 10 years, but this has not been validated empirically for most forest types including sub-boreal spruce-dominated forests of central British Columbia, Canada. Therefore., we sought to determine the timing of the source to sink transition for a sub-boreal clearcut. Clearcuts such as the one documented in this study occurring on glaciolacustrine deposits with relatively poor drainage represent about 20% of the 1.5 million ha in the Prince George area. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) for a clearcut was measured over four growing seasons in years 5, 6, 8 and 10 after harvest. A Bowen ratio approach in combination with a bottom-up modeled NEE based on ecosystem component CO2-flux measurements was used for years 5 and 6. In years 8 and 10, growing season NEE was measured using an open-path eddy covariance system. A cross comparison of Bowen ratio and eddy covariance systems was performed and measurements agreed relatively well (r(2) = 0.58). The results demonstrated that while this clearcut was still a source for C (NEE of +336 to +487 g C m(-2)) after 6 years, it was most likely a sink for C between 8 (NEE of - 189 to -52 g C m(-2)) and 10 (NEE of -185 to -48 g C m(-2)) years following harvest.

AB  - Inonotus tomentosus (Fr.) Teng causes Tomentosus root disease in spruce trees throughout the boreal and sub-boreal forests of British Columbia. Site and soil characteristics are related to the incidence of this fungus in wet, cool sub-boreal spruce forests located near prince George, British Columbia. Two-hundred and ninety-six plots, 25.2 m in diameter, were examined to determine the incidence of I. tomentosus, and several sire and soil variables were measured. These included soil moisture and nutrient regime, slope position, soil texture, soil coarseness, humus form, spruce density, tree species composition and soil pH. The incidence of I, tomentosus infection ranged from none to 31% of spruce trees per plot. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in percent infection were found between soil moisture regimes, soil moisture by soil nutrient regimes, and slope position. All of these site and soil variables are used, in British Columbia, to determine a 'site series', which is a site specific ecological classification unit used to determine harvest methods and silviculture prescriptions. The most important site variable influencing disease incidence is suggested to be soil moisture regime as influenced by slope position and soil texture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper contributes to recent debates about the geography of power, the nation-state, carto graphic history, and postcolonial theory. It does so by connecting the themes of these literatures and exploring empirically the claims about the narration of nation made by the postcolonial theorist Homi Bhabha, The two empirical case studies come from contemporary Canada, and concern, in part, the mapping of the nation-state The first case is a British Columbia trial in which two First Nations, the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en, brought a case against the provincial and federal governments over the recognition of their native sovereignty. The second study is of volume 1 of the Historical Atlas of Canada, which, unlike many ochers before it, sought to place native peoples and spaces within the overarching cartography of the country. In both studies, the ambivalent (post) colonial power relations of cartography-the fact that they can work bath for and against colonialism-become evident. They therefore serve as exemplary lessons concerning the political geography of mapping and the chronic persistence into the present of colonial assumptions about cartography. But more than this, the studies also raise significant questions about the limits of Bhabha's locution of "location" as a site for a performative form of political agency. The paper suggests, therefore, that, while spatial theorists can usefully draw on Bhabha's postcolonial supplements to theories of the nation, the work of producing postcolonial,geographies of national negotiations simultaneously supplements and displaces Bhabha's own abstraction of agency.

AB  - Host tree diameter is considered an important predictor of the population dynamics of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), but the relationship between host tree diameter and beetle traits is unclear. The primary objective of this study was to determine how the quality of individual mountain pine beetles, measured as body size (pronotum width) and lipid content, varied with the diameter of lodgepole pine trees, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelmann (Pinaceae). Naturally attacked trees, ranging in diameter from 10 to 35 cm, were selected from stands near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Colonisation density and pupal density generally increased with tree diameter, but the number of pupal chambers per gallery start remained constant. Tree diameter positively affected beetle body size, which in turn was positively correlated with absolute lipid content in both sexes and relative lipid content in males. However, tree diameter did not directly predict absolute lipid content, and relative lipid content decreased with tree diameter in males. Larger beetles emerged earlier in the emergence period with relative lipid content remaining constant throughout emergence. All relationships had considerable unexplained variation. Thus, the use of tree diameter or emergence time as predictors of population dynamics of mountain pine beetles should be done with caution.

AB  - The Endako batholith is a composite batholith that consists of early foliated hornblende +/- biotite diorites, intermediate-age unfoliated hornblende +/- biotite diorites, and late granodiorites to monzogranites. These latter plutons host the Endako molybdenite deposit, a major porphyry deposit located in the central Canadian Cordillera. Extensive K-Ar dating on the batholith had given relatively reproducible ages centered on 140 Ma, indicating a short life span for magmatic activity However, a combined U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar study has resulted in a substantial reappraisal of the ape and time span of intrusive activity and its association with molybdenite mineralization. The new data show that the batholith had a protracted emplacement history covering similar to 75 m.y., with clear evidence for periods of magmatic quiescence. The oldest magmatic suite of the Endako batholith, the Stern Creek suite, is dated at similar to 220 Ma and comprises foliated gabbros and diorites. Mafic to intermediate plutons of the Stal: Lake suite range in age from 180 Ma to 161 Ma. The Francois Lake suite is divided into two subsuites: the Glenannan subsuite dated at 157 Ma to similar to 155 Ma and the 149 to 145 Ma Endako subsuite that hosts the Endako molybdenite deposit. 40Ar/39Ar dating of hydrothermal biotite indicates molybdenite mineralization is genetically associated with terminal stages of magmatic activity. Biotite within the mine had its 40Ar/39Ar systematics reset at similar to 145 Ma by hydrothermal fluids with temperatures in excess of 300 degreesC. This resetting is associated with intrusion of the 145.1 +/- 0.2 Ma Casey phase monzogranite, the youngest phase within die Endako subsuite. A further partial resetting of biotite is interpreted to be coeval with Eocene intrusion of the high-level, miarolitic Sam Ross Creek phase and numerous mafic dikes that cut through the region. Hydrothermal fluids associated with this latter event were below biotite closure temperature and do not appear to have any relationship to molybdenite mineralization within the Endako deposit. The new geochronologic data, coupled with detailed mapping, show a general age progression from mafic plutonism at the margins to a central core of high-level granodiorite to monzogranite. The data document the existence of a long-lived, relatively stationary magmatic center. Pulsed magmatism, evident even within individual magmatic suites, may play a major role in concentrating and ultimately depositing molybdenite in some porphyry systems. At Endako, molybdenite would have formed within the higher level portions of the batholith, a position that would normally have rendered the deposit prone to erosional removal. However, subsequent Eocene Extensional block faulting may explain the preservation of this Jurassic deposit, which is the oldest economic molybdenite deposit in the Cordillera of North America.

AB  - Small resource-based communities across Canada are experiencing rapid change within a volatile, fluctuating global economy. As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change.

AB  - Epiphyte diversity and abundance were examined along the Fraser River and its tributaries in central-interior British Columbia at varying distances from point-source air pollution discharges. Black cottonwood (Populus balsamifera L. ssp. trichocarpa (Torr. & A. Gray ex Hook.) Brayshaw trunks near discharges in Prince George had comparatively low epiphyte diversity and supported an unusual acidiphilic lichen community, including Tuckermannopsis chlorophylla (Willd.) Hale, Usnea lapponica Vain., and Vulpicida canadensis (Rasanen) J.-E. Mattsson & M.J. Lai. At a greater distance from air pollution sources, a more characteristic flora was observed, including Collema Wigg. spp., Lecidea erythrophaea Florke, Leptogium (Ach.) Gray spp., Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm., Nephroma parile (Ach.) Ach., Peltigera Willd. spp., and Strangospora moriformis (Ach.) Stein. These changes were accompanied by large differences in bark pH; mean values ranged from 3.7 in Prince George to 6.7 in upriver stands for black cotton-woods, from 3.5 to 5.4 for live spruce branches (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and from 3.1 to 4.9 for dead spruce branches, respectively. Epiphyte communities proximal to Prince George were characterized by many nitrophilous species. Our data showed a strong covariate influence of climate, with Lobarion community lichens more abundant in the easternmost high-precipitation plots. Numerous provincial-and global-level conservation priority species were found, including Collema quadrifidum D. F. Stone & McCune, newly discovered for Canada; Collema coniophilum Goward, a Species at Risk Act listed species; and provincially at risk Heterodermia speciosa (Wulf.) Trev., Physcia tribacia (Ach.) Nyl., and Santessoniella saximontana T. Sprib., P. M. Jorg. & M. Schultz, mostly in sites distant from air pollution sources.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins is endemic to lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelmann, forests in western Canada. However, the current beetle epidemic in this area highlights the challenges faced by forest managers tasked with prioritizing stands for mitigation activities such as salvage harvesting and direct control methods. In western Canada, the operational risk rating system for mountain pine beetle is based on biological knowledge gained from a rich legacy of stand-scale field studies. Due to the large spatial (millions of hectares affected) and temporal (over 10 years) extents of the current epidemic, new research into large-area mountain pine beetle processes has revealed further insights into the landscape-scale characteristics of beetle infested forests. in this paper, we evaluated the potential for this new knowledge to augment an established system for rating the short-term risk of tree mortality in a stand due to mountain pine beetle. New variables explored for utility in risk rating include direct shortwave radiation, site index, diameter at breast height, the temporal trends in local beetle populations, Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification and beetle-host interaction variables. Proportional odds ordinal regression was used to develop a model for the Vanderhoof Forest District in west-central British Columbia. Prediction on independent data was assessed with the area under the receiver operator curve (AUC), indicating good discriminatory power (AUC = 0.84) for predicting levels of mountain pine beetle-caused pine mortality.

AB  - This study assesses the potential energy savings from passive solar design for new Canadian single-family dwellings across eight representative climate and population zones - Vancouver, Prince George, Yellowknife, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa and Halifax. Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Canadian Cordillera in central British Columbia has seen the Mesozoic subduction of an oceanic terrane; the amalgamation of volcanic-arc terranes; continued intermittent Mesozoic compression and magmatism; and Tertiary wrenching, extension and magmatism. Except in its northernmost mountain ranges, the area is extensively covered in glacial drift and thin veneers of Tertiary volcanic rocks. In 1994, a group of scientists and technologists believed they could understand that cover, see through it, and discover the components of that collision and extensional orogen. They would apply modern techniques of isotopic and paleontological geochronology; lake-sediment, till, and plant geochemistry; detailed gravity, magnetic, radiometric, paleomagnetic, and electromagnetic surveys; and isotopic and trace element lithochemistry, as they conducted extensive bedrock and surficial mapping. This special issue summarizes a cross-section of the scientific contributions derived from that mapping conducted under the auspices of the Nechako NATMAP Project. It demonstrates the absolute necessity of applying modern isotopic and paleontologic geochronology to understand the Phanerozoic geology of the Cordillera. It emphasizes the necessity of detailed aeromagnetic surveys (500 m or less line spacing) in looking through covered terranes at anything more than 1 : 250 000 scale. And, it shows the immense utility of applying various geochemical techniques to solve geological problems and establish baselines for future research and economic development. Bedrock and surficial mapping in the central Cordillera, using these and other techniques, have established the nature and timing of Mesozoic crustal growth, Tertiary crustal thinning, and the associated formation of mineral deposits.

AB  - Population fragmentation compromises population viability, reduces a species ability to respond to climate change, and ultimately may reduce biodiversity. We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

AB  - Purpose In 1950, the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) was given a perpetual water license for a large section of Northern British Columbia, Canada. The benefit to the original owner of the water rights, the Province of British Columbia, was economic and population growth. The purpose of this paper is to follow the contestation over these rights from 1948 to 2016. Design/methodology/approach An institutional logics perspective was taken to analyze the main actors and how their relative power (dominant versus fringe) changed in the institutional field. Archival data and selected interviews were mapped to institutional logics across three time periods. Findings In the inter-temporal setting, many of the actors that were fringe in 1950 became more dominant by 2016. For example, the local indigenous peoples, the Cheslatta Carrier First Nation, were flooded off their land to make way for Alcan's dam. They ended up as very powerful players in the institutional field. The perpetual rights given to Alcan made it a dominant actor across all time periods, despite changes in the logics of the institutional field. Research limitations/implications A single case was studied; other comparative settings should be explored to contrast and compare. The data were primarily archival, supplemented by only three interviews of those related to the case study. This case study is also one where water rights were privatized in perpetuity, which may not be the case in other settings. Practical implications Current governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should use this case to understand the long-term effects of resource policy decisions. Social implications The building of large dams has been, and continues to be, used worldwide to provide power to create economic growth. Our setting provides insight into the long-term societal outcomes of using water rights in this way. Originality/value This is an original use of institutional logics around a natural resource-based institutional field. Using institutional logics in a multi-period setting, focusing on the power relations of the key actors, and how they can be constrained by historical forces, provides a contribution to the literature.

AB  - Little information exists on the use of condoms as protective barriers to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among indigenous people in Canada. This study explores risk factors of inconsistent condom use (during consensual sex) over time among participants in the Cedar Project, a prospective cohort study of indigenous young people living in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use drugs. Due to the serial measurements for each study subject, generalized estimating equations modeling with logit link was used to accommodate the temporal correlation within subjects. For young women, inconsistent condom use over time was predicted by having a recent STI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 2.79]), smoking crack daily (AOR = 1.63, 95%CI [1.02, 2.61]), and having experienced recent sexual abuse (AOR = 2.07, 95%CI [1.20, 3.56]). Among young men, living in Prince George (AOR = 1.63, 95%CI [1.14, 2.39]) and daily crack smoking (AOR = 1.56, 95%CI [1.02, 2.40]) were associated with inconsistent condom use over time. Among participants who used injection drugs, inconsistent condom use was associated with smoking crack daily (AOR = 1.59, 95%CI [1.04, 2.43]) and sharing needles (AOR = 1.78, 95%CI [1.26, 2.51]). The availability and effectiveness of sexual health services must be prioritized for indigenous people, and the design of culturally safe sexual health programs requires the meaningful involvement of young indigenous people.

AB  - The Spences Bridge Group is a mid-Cretaceous (104 Ma) volcanic succession in the southern Intermontane Belt of the Canadian Cordillera (50.5 degrees N,121 degrees W). It comprises the Pimainus Formation (mafic to felsic lava, volcaniclastic and interbedded epiclastic rocks) and the overlying Spius Formation (andesitic lava flows). Including previous work, we have 55 sites distributed among 15 localities representing most of the > 3000 m thickness. Forty-seven sites (286 oriented cores, 457 specimens), mainly andesites, yielded acceptable data. The beds are gently to moderately tilted, partly due to synvolcanic deformation. Samples taken from a sequence of flows at any one locality have, with one exception, well-grouped magnetization directions. Polarities are all normal, as expected for rocks laid down in the Cretaceous Normal Superchron. Declinations always are clockwise of that expected of cratonic North America, indicating 60 degrees rotation of the Spences Bridge Group as a whole. However, declinations differ from locality to locality, implying relative interlocality rotations about vertical axes. Hence inclination-only analysis has been used to estimate dispersion, mean inclination, and paleolatitude. Minimum dispersion for the Spius Formation (27 sites) was achieved after 80% untilting, but the changes between 80 and 100% untilting are insignificant, indicating that magnetization was acquired predominantly before tilting. By contrast, minimum dispersion for the Pimainus Formation (20 sites) was achieved after 50% untilting, indicating that magnetization was acquired after synvolcanic tilting when buried beneath the overlying Spius Formation. Polished thin section studies show that magnetite in the Pimainus Formation has undergone extensive low temperature hydrothermal alteration, whereas magnetite in the Spius Formation shows little alteration. Throughout the range of tilt correction, from 0% to 100%, the mean inclinations of both formations were less than expected from observations obtained from mid-Cretaceous rocks of cratonic North America. The best estimate of paleolatitude (from the Spius Formation) is 50.8 degrees +/- 5.0 degrees (P=0.05), which is 9.5 degrees +/- 5.7 degrees less than would be expected had the rocks had been rigidly attached to North America. This corresponds to displacement from the south of 1100 +/- 600 km. Displacement between the northern Intermontane Belt and craton probably was accommodated along major strike-slip faults (Northern Rocky Mountain Trench, Finlay, Pinchi etc.). In the south, our results require a major dextral fault (the Intra-Quesnellia fault) to be situated during Late Cretaceous or Paleocene time within or marginal to the Omineca Belt, along which about 1000 km of dextral motion occurred. This could be a southern extension of the Pinchi Fault whose trace is now obscured by Eocene extension and tectonic denudation. The results also indicate that the largest tectonic discontinuity in the Canadian Cordillera occurs not to the east of the Intermontane Belt, as commonly assumed, but to the west, because the displacements relative to cratonic North America observed from the Intermontane Belt are only about one third of those observed from the-Coast Belt.

AB  - Children's exposures to ambient and non-ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were determined using the sulphate and elemental carbon components of the PM2.5 mixture as tracers of the ambient contribution during a 6-week winter period in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Personal exposures to PM2.5 were measured in children at 5 elementary schools located throughout the city and ambient samples were collected on school rooftops. Average ambient levels and personal exposures during this time period were 13.8 mu g m(-3) and 16.4 mu g m(-3) respectively. From the data pooled across individuals, use of the two different tracers indicated identical estimates of median exposure to ambient PM2.5 (7.5 mu g m(-3)) and similar estimates of non-ambient generated exposure (6.4 and 5.0 mu g m(-3)) and infiltration (0.49 and 0.52) for the sulphate and elemental carbon approach, respectively. The median fraction of the ambient concentration resulting in exposure or exposure factors were 0.54 and 0.55 respectively, however lower values of 0.46 and 0.42 were determined from regression analysis. A strong association was found between exposure to ambient PM2.5 and measured ambient concentrations at both the closest school monitor (median r = 0.92) and a central site (median r = 0.88) demonstrating that the central site monitor was suitable for assessing longitudinal ambient generated exposure throughout the city. These results support the use of elemental carbon as a tracer of ambient generated exposure and the use of ambient data as estimates of longitudinal changes in children's exposure in this setting. The importance of both ambient and non-ambient sources of PM2.5 is emphasized by their almost equal contribution to total personal exposures. Comparison with other studies suggests a limited influence of climate and the cold season in Prince George on exposure levels and found similar mean non-ambient generated exposures despite large variability across and within subjects in any given location.

AB  - Field experiments evaluated yield response to deep-pit poultry manure application to barley on a clay soil near Prince George and a grass-legume forage on a silty clay loam soil near Chilliwack, B.C. Substantial dry matter yield increases were measured at manure applications up to 20 t ha-1. Subsamples of both crops and the poultry manure were analyzed for Cu, Zn, Mn, Ba, Pb, Ni, Cr, Cd, B and Co. Selenium analyses were made on selected crop samples. There were no indications of toxicity problems even at 40 t ha-1, the highest application. Copper and Zn concentrations in forages were increased by the poultry manure and the Mn/Cu ratio tended to decrease with manure application.

AB  - Porphyry deposits are intrusion-related, large tonnage low grade mineral deposits with metal assemblages that may include all or some of copper, molybdenum, gold and silver. The genesis of these deposits is related to the emplacement of intermediate to felsic, hypabyssal, generally porphyritic intrusions that are commonly formed at convergent plate margins. Porphyry deposits of the Canadian Cordillera occur in association with two distinctive intrusive suites: calc-alkalic and alkalic. In the Canadian Cordillera, these deposits formed during two separate time periods: Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic (early Mesozoic), and Late Cretaceous to Eocene (Mesozoic-Cenozoic). Deposits of the early Mesozoic period occur in at least three different are terranes (Wrangellia, Stikinia and Quesnellia) with a single deposit occurring in the oceanic assemblage of the Cache Creek terrane. These terranes were located outboard from continental North America during formation of most of their contained early Mesozoic porphyry deposits. Some of the deposits of this early period may have been emplaced during terrane collisions. Metal assemblages in deposits of the calc-alkalic suite include Mo-Cu (Brenda), Cu-Mo (Highland Valley, Gibraltar), Cu-Mo-Au-Ag (Island Copper, Schaft Creek) and Cu-Au (Kemess, Kerr). The alkalic suite deposits are characterized by a Cu-Au assemblage (Copper Mountain, Afton-Ajax, Mt. Milligan, Mount Polley, Galore Creek). Although silver is recovered from calc-alkalic and alkalic porphyry copper mining operations, silver data are seldom included in the published reserve figures. Those available are in the range of 1-2 grams per tonne (g.t(-1)). Alkalic suite deposits are restricted to the early Mesozoic and display distinctive petrology, alteration and mineralization that suggest a similar tectonic setting for both Quesnellia and Stikinia in Early Jurassic time. The younger deposits, late Mesozoic to Cenozoic in age, formed in an intracontinental setting, after the outboard host are and related terranes accreted to the western margin of North America. These deposits are interpreted to occur in continental are settings, and individual deposits are hosted by a variety of older country rocks. These younger deposits also show a spectrum of metal associations: Cu-Mo (Huckleberry, Berg), Cu-Au (-Mo) (Bell, Granisle, Fish Lake, Casino), Mo (Endako, Boss Mountain, Kit-sault, Quartz Hill), Mo-W (Logtung), Au-W (Dublin Gulch) and Au (Ft. Knox). There may be a continuum between Mo, Mo-W, Au-Mo-W and Au deposits. The distribution and timing of these post-accretion deposits likely reflect major crustal structures and subduction geometry. Cordilleran porphyry metallic deposits show the full range of morphological and depth relationships found in porphyry deposits worldwide. In addition, the Cordillera contains numerous alkalic suite deposits, which are rare worldwide: the unusual, possibly syntectonic Gibraltar deposit; and end-member gold-rich granite-hosted deposits, such as Ft. Knox (Alaska).

AB  - Producing and improving hydrological and hydrodynamic forecasts while accounting for uncertainty through a probabilistic approach is useful in various applications, such as for water temperature forecasting. To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system.

AB  - Based on fieldwork completed in two British Columbia locales-prince George and Abbotsford-this study places oral histories of fatherhood in the context of idealistic depictions of masculine domesticity that circulated in the mass print media during the baby boom. It addresses tendencies among the men interviewed to frame stories of being husbands, parents, coaches, and family vacationers in material terms. Their self-portraits of domestic masculinity, incorporating the details of trailers, boats, cars, televisions, or vacations, suggest how gendered aspects of consumption by fathers in the 1950s and early 1960s became privileged as identifiable measures of both manful assertiveness and respectable manhood.

AB  - Wood is a common material used for the manufacture of many products, and submerged wood, in particular, has been used in niche markets and musical instruments. In order to examine if submerged wood in British Columbia, Canada, would be appropriate for use as musical instruments, a study was performed in 2007 on submerged wood from Ootsa Lake, British Columbia, Canada. The results of that study showed the wood was not suitable for musical instruments. In this paper, the wood samples were allowed to age untouched in a laboratory setting and were then retested under the hypothesis that physical acoustic characteristics would improve. It was shown, however, that acoustic properties became less adequate after being left to dry over time. This article describes the density, speed of sound, acoustic constant and characteristic impedance properties for submerged wood and a comparison is made for different applications for musical instruments.

AB  - This paper, which described an evaluation of the suitability of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) for the manufacture of preservative-treated plywoood and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), was part of an overall study to explore opportunities to extract greater value from subalpine fir (Knudson et al. 2008, McFarling et al. 2009). Due to preferential logging of lodgepole pine, the availability of subalpine fir in British Columbia is projected to increase significantly, in some regions to as high as 30 percent of the softwood harvest. Logs for the vencer products studied came from five subalpine fir trees (one dominant, one codominant, and three intermediate) from a Canadian Forest Products Ltd. (Canfor) logging site in the Fort St. James harvest region of British Columbia. The trees were considered representative of the site type and age class expected to be harvested over the next period of years. Study results indicated that subalpine fir is a satisfactory species for manufacturing construction plywood or lower stiffness grade LVL. This study confirmed that subalpine fir plywood, made from both incised and non-incised veneer, can be preservative treated with alkaline copper quat (ACQ-D) and copper azole to meet CSA 080. 15-97 PWF standard (CSA 1997). Currently subalpine fir plywood is not used for permanent wood foundations (PWF) because it cannot be treated with copper chromated arsenate to meet the CSa standard. Other British Columbia softwood species that are usually processed with subalpine fir are classified as unsuitable for preservative treatment. This study indicates that a 100 percent subalpine fir plywood panel substrate would be suitable for PWFs when treated with amine copper preservatives.

AB  - Adaptation is now broadly accepted as a necessary response to climate change. Local adaptation strategies should be developed with decision-makers familiar with the unique characteristics of a community. As part of ongoing research on adaptation in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada we hosted a workshop with City staff and community stakeholders to build local capacity and initiate an adaptation strategy. Past climate trends and future scenarios were used to gain a better understanding of the changes occurring and expected in the region. The highest priorities identified for Prince George relate to forest fires, flooding, emergency response to extreme events, water supply and transportation infrastructure. The workshop framework represents a tool which communities can apply to outline adaptation priorities within a limited time frame. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lithostratigraphy and microfacies of the Bashkirian to Asselian Pope succession limestone of the Cache Creek Group near Fort St. James, central British Columbia, were lithologically grouped into five facies associations A to E. On the basis of fusulines and conodonts, facies associations A to D and the lower part of facies association E are time-equivalent, ranging from the lower Bashkirian to lower Kasimovian, and the upper part of facies association E is dated as upper Gzhelian to Asselian. The Pope succession limestone is interpreted to have been built on a basaltic basement of an oceanic plateau or seamount in an open-ocean realm. The limestone is devoid of terrigenous grains, is associated with basaltic rocks, and laterally grades into deeper-water spicular cherts. Microfacies analysis of facies associations A to E showed that they exhibit characteristic facies of (A) deep-water basinal setting, (B) marginal basin to lower slope, (C) shallow-subtidal bank margin, (D) peritidal algal mound on the bank margin, and (E) shallow-subtidal bank margin to intertidal lagoonal flat,. Moscovian to Asselian rocks of facies associations C, D, and E record an upward increase of low-relief encrusting calci-microbes as rock-builders. This tendency is closely correlated with that in limestone buildups mapped from the Panthalassan Ocean. The abundance of phylloid algal plates and the reefal facies of the Moscovian rocks of facies association D are the same as the reef-building phylloid algae of the Bashkirian to Sakmarian limestone of both the Tethyan and Panthalassan oceans. The Pope succession limestone has many similarities in tectonic, stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and paleontologic aspects to the Akiyoshi buildup, a representative Panthalassan buildup in a Permian subduction-related accretionary complex in Japan. The timing of the increasing importance of the calci-microbes and phylloid algae in the Pope and Akiyoshi buildups is also correlatable.

AB  - Hydrothermal alteration and fluid chemistry data of the early Cretaceous Endako porphyry molybdenum deposit, British Columbia, provide new information on the hydrothermal fluids associated with low-fluorine molybdenite mineralization. Molybdenite mineralization and hydrothermal alteration occur as early quartz +/- molydenite stockwork veins with K feldspar-bearing salvages and paragenetically later quartz-molybdenite ribbon veins with sericite-bearing selvages. Late hydrothermal alteration is associated with the development of kaolinite and postore (Tertiary age) calcite veins. Fluid inclusions in early-formed quartz +/- molybdenite stockwork veins with K feldspar-bearing alteration assemblages are dominated by moderate salinity (5 to 15 wt % NaCl equiv), liquid-rich (type 1) and rare high-salinity (30 to 45 wt % NaCl equiv), halite-bearing (type 3) fluid inclusions. Type 1 and type 3 fluid inclusions in early veins homogenize between 390 degrees and 430 degrees C and 375 degrees and 420 degrees C, respectively. Secondary fluid inclusions (type 2) of low salinity (1 to 5 wt % NaCl equiv) in these early veins are minor, and homogenize between 130 degrees and 285 degrees C. Fluid inclusions in quartz-molybdenite ribbon veins with sericite-bearing alteration assemblages are dominated by moderate-salinity, liquid-rich (type 1) inclusions, with minor type 2 fluid inclusions. Type 1 fluid inclusions of ribbon veins homogenize between 360 degrees and 400 degrees C. Fluid inclusions in postore cal cite veins are of only type 2 fluid inclusions, which homogenize at 209 degrees C. Hydrothermal fluids recorded by type I and type 3 fluid inclusions in early veins were trapped under lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions between 0.3 and less than or equal to 2.0 kbar, and 360 degrees and 560 degrees C. Postore fluids recorded by type 2 fluid inclusions were trapped under conditions less than or equal to 0.5 kbar, and between 190 degrees and 300 degrees C. Quartz stockwork and ribbon Veins possess delta(18)O values of 8.4 +/- 0.2 (n = 9) and 8.4 +/- 0.6 (n = 13), respectively. Hydrothermal K feldspar and biotite from K feldspar alteration assemblages possess delta(18)O values of 6.8 +/- 0.4 (n = 7) and 3.5 +/- 0.8 (n = 8), respectively. Oxygen isotope geothermometry of quartz-biotite and quartz-K feldspar pairs from K feldspar alteration assemblages yield temperatures between 200 degrees and 490 degrees C, which is similar to the trapping temperatures of hydrothermal fluids determined from fluid inclusion studies associated with molybdenite mineralization, the development of kaolinite, and calcite veins. The oxygen isotope temperatures of the quartz-biotite and quartz-K feldspar pairs suggest that K feldspar and biotite either record the approximate O-18 composition of hydrothermal fluids associated with K feldspar alteration or have undergone O-18 exchange with late-stage hydrothermal fluids. Hydrogen isotope composition of quartz stockwork and ribbon veins fluid inclusion waters range between -105 and -113 per mil. Solute chemistry studies of fluid inclusion waters indicate that ore forming fluids from Endako have low Br/Cl and Br/Na ratios, and high I/Cl and I/Br ratios in comparison to Porgera (epithermal), Babine Lake (porphyry Cu), and St. Austell, Capitan Pluton (vein) deposits associated with magmatic processes. Na/K ratios of fluid inclusion waters yield temperatures (308 degrees to 429 degrees C) similar to those determined from type 1 and type 3 fluid inclusions and stable isotope thermometry. Results from fluid inclusion and solute chemistry studies indicate the involvement of hydrothermal fluids exsolved from a crystallizing melt in the formation of the Endako molybdenum deposit. However, oxygen and hydrogen isotope values deviate from the generally accepted magmatic compositions, which suggests the early involvement of meteoric water in the ore-forming fluids and ore genesis.

AB  - A blueschist and eclogite terrane is associated with one of the largest faults in the Canadian Cordilleran Orogen, the Pinchi fault. Blueschists (in situ) and retrogressed eclogite blocks occur along the Pinchi fault zone near 54 degrees 30'N and 124 degrees W. Critical blueschist facies mineral assemblages include lawsonite-glaucophane, jadeite-lawsonite-glaucophane-quartz, and aragonite. White mica 40Ar/39Ar spectra on blueschist and eclogite yield ages in the range 221.8 +/- 1.9 to 223.5 +/- 1.7 Ma, establishing a direct link between the blueschists and eclogites. Preservation of aragonite sets rigid constraints on the pressure-temperature-fluid-time conditions of unroofing. K-Ar dates indicate that this is some of the oldest documented metamorphic aragonite. Comparison with computed petrogenetic grids suggests that-metamorphic temperatures were in the range 200-300 degrees C, with pressures greater than 8-10 kbar (1 kbar = 100 MPa). Unroofing likely occurred during collision of the Cache Creek terrane with Quesnellia in the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic. The fault was initiated as a plate boundary and was active as late as Eocene time as a strike-slip zone. The Pinchi blueschist terrane is similar to others in the North American Cordillera and highlights a tectonic regime of repeated blueschist metamorphism and rapid unroofing along many parts of the western margin of North America in the early Mesozoic.

AB  - The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) covered much of the mountainous northwestern part of North America at least several times during the Pleistocene. The pattern and timing of its growth and decay are, however, poorly understood. Here, we present a reconstruction of the pattern of ice-sheet retreat in central British Columbia at the end of the last glaciation based on a palaeoglaciological interpretation of ice-marginal meltwater channels, eskers and deltas mapped from satellite imagery and digital elevation models. A consistent spatial pattern of high-elevation (1600-2400m a.s.l.), ice-marginal meltwater channels is evident across central British Columbia. These landforms indicate the presence of ice domes over the Skeena Mountains and the central Coast Mountains early during deglaciation. Ice sourced in the Coast Mountains remained dominant over the southern and east-central parts of the Interior Plateau during deglaciation. Our reconstruction shows a successive westward retreat of the ice margin from the western foot of the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the formation and rapid evolution of a glacial lake in the upper Fraser River basin. The final stage of deglaciation is characterized by the frontal retreat of ice lobes through the valleys of the Skeena and Omineca Mountains and by the formation of large esker systems in the most prominent topographic lows of the Interior Plateau. We conclude that the CIS underwent a large-scale reconfiguration early during deglaciation and was subsequently diminished by thinning and complex frontal retreat towards the Coast Mountains.

AB  - Rocks hosting the Silver Queen epithermal Au-Ag-Zn-Pb-Cu vein deposit near Owen Lake, British Columbia, belong to the Tip Top Hill volcanics. They are lithologically similar to the informally named Upper Cretaceous Kasalka Group rocks exposed in the type area at Tahtsa Lake, 75 km southwest of the deposit, and at Mount Cronin, 100 km northwest of the deposit. The Kasalka Group rocks in the Tahtsa Lake area give questionable dates of 105 +/- 5 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock but are cut by intrusions dated at 83.8 +/- 2.8 Ma by K-Ar on biotite. The sequence at the Silver Queen deposit includes a polymictic conglomerate, followed upward by felsic fragmental rocks and a thick porphyritic andesite flow and sill unit, cut by microdiorite and quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusions. The porphyritic andesite and the microdiorite have been dated as Late Cretaceous (78.3 +/- 2.7 and 78.7 +/- 2.7 Ma, respectively, by K-Ar on whole rock), close to previous dates for these rocks (77.1 +/- 2.7 and 75.3 +/- 2.0 Ma, respectively). The quartz - feldspar porphyry intrudes the porphyritic andesites but has an older U-Pb zircon date of 84.6 +/- 0.2 Ma, probably due to underestimation of the true age of the host rocks by the K-Ar whole-rock method. Later dykes correlate with younger volcanic rocks belonging to the Ootsa Lake and Endako groups. Eocene pre- and postmineral plagioclase-rich dykes (51.9 +/- 1.8 to 51.3 +/- 1.8 Ma) and late diabase dykes (50.4 +/- 1.8 Ma; all by K-Ar on whole rock) may be correlative with trachyandesite volcanics of the Goosly Lake Formation, part of the Eocene Endako Group. These volcanics have been dated elsewhere at 55.6 +/- 2.5 to 48.8 +/- 1.8 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock and biotite, respectively. Mineralization at Silver Queen is therefore similar in age to, but slightly younger than, the producing Equity mine located 30 km to the northeast, which is estimated at 58.5 +/- 2.0 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock.

AB  - This study was designed to compare small mammal populations and diversity in similar cutover forest habitats in northeast China (Langxiang, Heilongjiang Province) and northwest Canada (Prince George, British Columbia). Populations were sampled on replicate live-trap grids during a period of high numbers of small mammals in autumn at each of the respective study areas. The brown-backed vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in China and the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) in Canada dominated their respective communities with Jolly-Seber population estimates ranging from 59 to 104 voles/ha. Secondary major species included the northern red-backed vole (C. rutilus), Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus), and striped field mouse (A. agrarius) in China, and the boreal red-backed vole (C gapperi) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) in Canada. Total average numbers of individuals were quite similar in each of the China (207) and Canada (209.5) communities. A greater biomass of small mammal species occurred at Langxiang (5.3 kg) than Prince George (4.2 kg) due to significantly larger body weights of C rufocanus and A. speciosus than M. pennsylvanicus and P. maniculatus, respectively. Diversity measurements were similar, but species richness was somewhat higher in the small mammal community at Prince George than Langxiang. There was generally a remarkable similarity in relative abundance and diversity of small mammal species occupying young cutover forest lands in northeast China and northwest Canada. This similarity suggests that the principles of managing temperate forests for wildlife diversity in North America could be applied to similar forests in Asia.

AB  - This paper presents results of a passive-source seismic mapping study in the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of central British Columbia, with the ultimate goal of contributing to assessments of hydrocarbon and mineral potential of the region. For the present study, an array of nine seismic stations was deployed in 2006-2007 to sample a wide area of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau. The specific goal was to map the thickness of the sediments and volcanic cover, and the overall crustal thickness and structural geometry beneath the study area. This study utilizes recordings of about 40 distant earthquakes from 2006 to 2008 to calculate receiver functions, and constructs S-wave velocity models for each station using the Neighbourhood Algorithm inversion. The surface sediments are found to range in thickness from about 0.8 to 2.7 km, and the underlying volcanic layer from 1.8 to 4.7 km. Both sediments and volcanic cover are thickest in the central portion of the study area. The crustal thickness ranges from 22 to 36 km, with an average crustal thickness of about 30-34 km. A consistent feature observed in this study is a low-velocity zone at the base of the crust. This study complements other recent studies in this area, including active-source seismic studies and magnetotelluric measurements, by providing site-specific images of the crustal structure down to the Moho and detailed constraints on the S-wave velocity structure.

AB  - A mixed conodont fauna-bearing limestone breccia, informally designated as Necoslie breccia, crops out as an internal sediment hosted by the Lower Moscovian limestone unit of the Pope limestone succession (Bashkirian to Asselian) of Cache Creek Complex in central British Columbia, reconstructed as a mid-oceanic buildup upon a seamount, or an oceanic plateau. Necoslie breccia consists predominantly of limestone fragments derived from the host rocks, with subordinate isolated skeletal debris, all embedded in a matrix of fine-grained clastic carbonates. The mixed conodont fauna yields the youngest element indicative of Carnian. Our microscopic examination and conodont paleontological data show that Necoslie breccia is better defined as a neptunian dyke formed by infilling sedimentation of carbonates in a fracturing-generated submarine cavity, rather than a karstic cave-fill deposit. We postulate that infilling sedimentation took place immediately after the formation of the cavity, most likely in a transgression period during Carnian time.

AB  - Results of regional lake sediment and till geochemistry surveys conducted in central British Columbia are compared for gold, arsenic, antimony, copper, zinc, molybdenum and lead. Samples were collected from 171 till sites and 119 lake sediment sites in a 1:50000 scale map sheet (NTS 93F/03). Surficial and bedrock geology maps and mineral deposit data are used to help evaluate the geochemical results. Till samples are from lodgment and basal meltout tills rather than other types of till or surficial sediment. Lake sediment sample sites include every lake and pond in the survey area and all major sub-basins in large lakes. The corroborative nature of the till and lake sediment geochemical surveys is indicated by the detection of all existing mineral occurrences in the map region by both methods, except two prospects not detected in the lake sediment data because they have no nearby lakes. Anomalous (> 95th percentile) concentrations of the seven elements in lake sediments and tills generally occur up to a few kilometers down-slope and down-ice, respectively, of mineralized areas. In addition, eleven new exploration targets with multi-element geochemical anomalies are highlighted by the two surveys. Six of the target areas are indicated by data from both sample media, three by till data alone and two by lake sediment data alone. The two surveys are also complementary, first because geologic interpretations from each can be integrated to constrain the location of potential mineralized source areas. Second, helicopter-supported lake sediment surveys and ground-based till surveys are often best suited for different areas due to variable access and terrain conditions, making the two survey types geographically complementary.

AB  - Analysis of over 10 000 water-well records has been used to produce new depth-to-bedrock maps for areas around five cities on the central Interior Plateau of central British Columbia: 100 Mile House, Prince George, Quesnel, Vanderhoof, and Williams Lake. Hitherto, exploration for mineral and hydrocarbon resources has been hampered by a lack of basic knowledge of the thickness of Neogene and Quaternary lithologies. Interpretation of these new maps provides first-order constraints on the localization of thick drift in pre-Late Wisconsinan bedrock paleovalleys, some of which are now buried. Basalt lavas of the Chilcotin Group are restricted to erosional remnants of previously extensive sheets emplaced onto an older peneplain. Our results confirm that the Neogene and Quaternary cover is primarily controlled by paleotopography and is generally thin and patchy across much of the region. Increased understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of cover produces a corresponding increase in the utility of geological, geochemical, and geophysical exploration techniques, and a reduction in the risk for future mineral exploration activities, especially when combined with more sophisticated data sets.

AB  - We use the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ( SRTM) data and digital terrain models from aerial photography to quantify the change of glacier volume in British Columbia ( BC), Canada for the period 1985 - 1999. We note substantial elevation bias in the SRTM elevations, typically on the order of - 12 m km(-1). The bias- corrected thinning rate is -0.78 +/- 0.19 m a(-1) which yields an annual volume loss of 22.48 +/- 5.53 km(-3) a(-1). This rate of glacier volume loss is 65% of the estimate uncorrected for elevation bias (34.7 km(-3) a(-1)) and cautions against the use of uncorrected SRTM data for glacier change studies. Glacier recession in BC could account for ca. 0.67 +/- 0.12 mm of sea level rise over the period 1985 - 1999 (0.05 +/- 0.009 mm yr(-1)) or about 8.3% of the contribution from mountain glaciers and ice caps. The recent rate of glacier loss in the Coast Mountains ( 17.0 km(-3) a(-1)) is approximately double that observed for the previous two decades.

AB  - The geochemical, mineralogical and lithological composition of modem stream bed material is examined in order to characterize sources and evaluate downstream mixing of sediments in the upper Fraser River drainage basin, British Columbia. The <63 mum fraction is emphasized for its relative mobility and ease of analysis using instrumental neutron activation. Overall, the composition of the stream sediments closely reflects bedrock distribution. Samples dominated by limestone and dolostone, calcite and dolomite, and related elements (Ca, Mg, Sr etc.) correspond to Lower and Middle Cambrian carbonate bedrock largely confined to the Moose River sub-basin. Clastic and non-quartzite metamorphic lithologies, primary and secondary aluminosilicate minerals and related elements (Al, Cs, Rb etc.) are largely derived from Miette Group bedrock and associated with the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Except in the case of the Moose River/Fraser River junction, the determination of proportional tributary contributions is complicated by variable or delayed mixing, localized floodplain or valley side sources, and limited contrast between source areas. At present the Moose River sub-basin contributes a greater proportion of the total and fine-grained sediment loads of the combined Fraser River than would be expected from drainage basin area alone. The imbalance is related to greater relief, precipitation and runoff in the Moose River sub-basin; however, the spatial association of carbonate-rich stream sediments, ice cover and carbonate bedrock exposure indicates that glaciers play a particularly important roll in generating fine-grained fluvial sediment. Since differences in glacier cover and glacier potential in the two major sub-basins are likely to be persistent, and since relative sediment yields from the sub-basins can be determined from sediment composition, a potential indicator of glacier variation and climate change during the Holocene is therein available.

AB  - This paper applied a recently developed Local Government Climate Action Assessment Framework to identify whether small municipalities in British Columbia are on track to meet their climate targets and to better understand the effectiveness of their climate-related actions. The aim of this paper was (1) to further test the assessment framework by evaluating its applicability for smaller municipalities, (2) to evaluate and categorize local progress in three small cities, namely Campbell River, Prince George and Revelstoke, and (3) to contrast these climate actions with actions taken by larger municipalities in BC, using the same assessment framework. This assessment revealed that key external support made available to expand on their Integrated Community Sustainability Plans provided for striking similarities among the three case studies regarding their strategies and plan formulations for which actions were largely transformative or reformative. However, the three small cities were lacking periodic reporting and monitoring of actions and presented shorter timeframes of up to 20-50 years for their planning horizons, all of which negatively impact their prioritization strategies. The main difference between larger and smaller cities was found among actions related to the feedback and evaluation category of the framework, with smaller cities performing more poorly. Greater shift in priorities away from climate change-related actions were evident in smaller local governments, signalling their more vulnerable position regarding changes in leadership in local and provincial administrations. This study highlights the key role that strategic alliances, networks, and external champions as partners play in planning and implementing climate action and in increasing public interest in sustainability. Thus, these should be fostered and promoted to keep building local capacity and effectively accelerate greater change through e.g., strengthening their capacity to implement, monitor and evaluate climate actions.

AB  - Adaptation is already a necessary response to climate change for northern communities. The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes. Lessons from the Prince George experience can be applied to other communities as they strive to effectively adapt to climate change.

AB  - New magnetic and paleomagnetic data for central British Columbia support and quantify the hypothesis that the area underwent significant Tertiary-age transtensional deformation. Paleomagnetically determined tilts in Eocene rocks indicate that four fault-bounded pits, which constitute the Endako molybdenum mine, were displaced on a series of normal (probably listric) faults that have separations of less than a kilometre. The interpretation also suggests there can be little vertical offset on the Denak West Fault, which separates the Denak East and Denak West pits. Regional paleomagnetic data indicate a predominance of easterly directed tilts to the east of the Casey Fault, but to the west a large variation in the orientation and magnitude of tilts is observed. Results at one site proximal to the Casey Fault indicate a component of dip-slip displacement on this dominantly dextral strike-slip fault. Mapped northeast- and northwest-trending faults commonly correspond to linear zones of steep magnetic gradient and near-surface magnetic sources. Several additional northwest- and northeast-trending lineaments are imaged in the magnetic data where no faults are mapped (particularly over massive and lithologically homogeneous phases of the Endako batholith). Euler deconvolution solutions confirm most such lineaments are also associated with shallow magnetic sources. In profile, they have either a fault or dyke character and are interpreted to be unmapped faults, some locally intruded by mafic dykes, which cut the region into a series of fault-bounded blocks.

AB  - This paper examines along-channel winds within Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada, that occur from both the interior plateau out toward the coast as outflows and from the coast inland as inflows. First, the relationships between along-channel winds and pressure, temperature, and humidity are explored in Howe Sound-Cheakamus Valley. The pressure gradients between Pam Rocks and Squamish and Pam Rocks and Pemberton have the strongest correlations with outflow strength and that between Pam Rocks and Squamish has the strongest correlation with inflow strength. Outflows (inflows) have lower (higher) temperatures and dew point temperatures, except for the inflows in summer, which have lower dewpoint temperatures than the overall mean. Second, two case studies of outflow events are presented and described during the period of intensive observations prior to and during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. The January 2010 outflow event is caused by a zone of strong across-barrier mean sea level pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is formed behind an Arctic front that moved southward across Howe Sound. The February 2010 outflow event is caused by an approaching sea level low pressure centre from the Pacific that formed a northeast-southwest mean sea level pressure gradient across southern British Columbia. In the January case, the outflow layer is about 1.5 km deep, while it is shallower in the February case. Only the January outflow case exhibits hydraulic behaviour.

AB  - Several techniques to determine the in-situ size, morphology, settling and storage characteristics of fine grained sediment have been used in the Fraser River at Prince George. The river was sampled both upstream and downstream of the effluent outflow of a major pulp mill (Northwood) to determine the role of this effluent in modifying the transport and storage of sediments, Both the natural suspended sediment load (upstream) and the effluent-sediment mix (downstream) were characterized by concentration, organic/inorganic ratios and image analysis to identify the presence and size of aggregates or flocs in the water column. Preliminary analysis of the data from the first eight months of 1997 indicates seasonal changes in flee size of the natural sediments but no significant difference between sites upstream and downstream of the effluent pipe. Buried gravel traps were used to quantify and characterize the amount of fine grained storage in the gravel bed during the post flooding period. Over short periods (four days) abundant fine grained (<63 mu m) material was collected. The modal size of the constituent particles in the size class below 150 mu m was 40-60 mu m This storage of silts and clays in the gravel bed is important in the context of both habitat quality and sediment associated contaminant transfers.

The 177 conodont collections, assigned to 20 faunas, range in age from Bashkirian (Late Carboniferous) to Norian (Late Triassic); 70 radiolarian collections representing 12 zones range from Gzhelian (Late Carboniferous) to Toarcian (Early Jurassic); 335 collections assigned to 11 fusulinacean assemblages (with associated foram-algal associations) range from Bashkirian to Wordian (Middle Permian); and two coral faunas are of Bashkirian and Wordian age. The fossils document a long but sporadic history of sedimentary events within the Cache Creek Complex that included two major carbonate buildups in the Late Carboniferous (Pope limestone) and Middle Permian (Copley limestone), punctuated by intervening Early Permian deepening; basaltic eruptions during the mid Carboniferous and mid Permian; the onset of oceanic chert sedimentation close to the Carboniferous-Permian boundary and its persistence through the Late Triassic (Sowchea succession); latest Permian and Early Triassic mixed clastics and volcanics (Kloch Lake succession); Middle and Late Triassic reworking of carbonates (Whitefish limestone), including cavity fill in older limestones (Necoslie breccia), and fine-grained clastic sedimentation extending into the Early Jurassic (Tezzeron succession). Tethyan, eastern Pacific, and (or) low-latitude biogeographic attributes of the faunas are noted in the Gzhelian (fusulines), Artinskian (conodonts, fusulines), Wordian (fusulines, corals, conodonts), and Ladinian (conodonts, radiolarians). The Cache Creek Terrane lay far to the west of the North American continent during these times.

AB  - Nd isotopic data are presented for a suite of metamorphic and plutonic rocks from a traverse across the Coast Mountains between Terrace and Prince Rupert, British Columbia, and for three contrasting batholiths in the Omineca Belt of southern Yukon. A presumed metamorphic equivalent of Jurassic volcanic rocks of the Stikine terrane gives epsilon(Nd) = +6, and a number of other metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks in the core of the Coast Mountains give epsilon(Nd) values from +3 to +7. A single metasedimentary rock approximately 3 km east of the Work Channel shear zone gives a epsilon(Nd) value of -9. Coast Belt plutons in the traverse yield epsilon(Nd) from -1 to +2. The Omineca Belt plutons give epsilon(Nd) from -10 to -17. All results are consistent with published data in demonstrating that (i) juvenile origins for both igneous and metamorphic rocks are common in the Coast Belt; (ii) representatives of a continental-margin sedimentary sequence with Precambrian crustal Nd are tectonically interleaved in the Coast Mountains; (iii) Coast Mountains plutons can be interpreted as derived from a blend of metamorphic rocks like those seen at the surface, or as are-type melts contaminated with the older crustal component; and (iv) Omineca Belt plutons are dominated by remelted Precambrian crustal rocks.

AB  - Two trials ("Wonowon'' and "Iron Creek'') in the Prince George Forest Region of interior British Columbia were begun in the mid 1980s to evaluate site preparation treatments for establishing white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) in the Boreal White and Black Spruce biogeoclimatic zone. The 14 treatments (9 or 10 per trial) were: [B.C.] Ministry, Sinkkila, and Bracke mounds; Bracke mounds manually supplemented with 20-, 14-, or 6-cm cappings of mineral soil; fertilized Sinkkila mounds; Bracke patches; fertilized Bracke patches; bladed strips; plowed ground; herbicide; and untreated controls, separately with both standard and nominally superior "alternate'' planting stock. With minor aberrations, each trial consists of 5 randomized complete blocks each with one 80-tree plot per treatment; planting was in spring, 1984 at Wonowon, 1987 at Iron Creek. All trees in mounding treatments and the inner 48 trees in other plots were monitored for performance through 1998 at Wonowon, 1996 at Iron Creek. The herbicide and plowing treatments, and mounds capped thickly enough with mineral soil to inhibit weed regrowth, were clearly superior to others. In the mounding treatments at Wonowon, survival rate increased with capping thickness, but, while the 14 and 20 cm cappings were best, significant differences among them were few after 15 growing seasons. In both trials, patch scarification gave poorer results than did planting without site preparation.

AB  - The synthetic pheromone (Z,Z) -3,13-octadecadien-1-yl acetate was tested in two trap types and at different loads for trapping the Douglas-fir pitch moth, Synanthedon novaroensis (Henry Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae), in a lodgepole pine, Pinus contorta Douglas ex London variety latifolia Engelmann, provenance trial at the Prince George Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This moth causes considerable problems in lodgepole pine seed orchards at this location. No significant differences in trap catches were found between wing traps and Unitraps in two experiments. There were no significant differences between catches in Unitraps baited with 50, 100, or 200 mug of the pheromone loaded on red rubber septa. In a second experiment, Unitraps baited with four rubber septa, each loaded with 200 jig fora total load of 800 mug, captured significantly more Doughts-fir pitch moths than those baited with one septum (200 mug) or two septa (400 mug) of the pheromone. All pheromone loads caught significantly more moths than unbaited control traps. Based OD trap catches in these trap bioassays, and catches in monitoring traps in four lodgepole pine seed orchards, 1996 through 2000, the flight period of S. novaroensis in north central British Columbia normally starts in early June, and lasts for 4-7 wk.

AB  - Abundant cinnabar (HgS) mineralization is associated with the Pinchi Fault in central British Columbia. Two formerly producing mercury mines have been developed on this fault: Pinchi and Bralorne Takla. The mercury content of till (a sediment type directly deposited by glaciers) in the area of this fault is primarily controlled by the occurrence of cinnabar mineralization in bedrock and the direction of ice flow. Cinnabar-bearing bedrock was eroded by glaciers, transported in the direction of ice flow, and deposited "down-ice" from its source. An example of such a dispersal train is documented for the Pinchi Mine area where mercury ore was transported over a distance of 12 km, as measured in the clay-sized fraction (< 0.002 mm) of till, and could have been transported over 24 km according to heavy mineral concentrates (specific gravity > 3.3) of this same sediment. Antimony, chromium, and nickel dispersal trains were also detected in the region. These data indicate that natural glacial processes can result in the "mobilization" of metals in the surficial environment, a factor which has to be considered at mine sites in glaciated terrain, where mine reclamation and remediation measures are now required.

AB  - In the stream culvert discharge design guidelines of the Forest Practices Code (FPC) of British Columbia (BC), the 100-year instantaneous flood (Q(100)) is assumed to be three times as large as the mean annual flood (Q(2)) regardless of basin characteristics and location in the province. A regional linear moment analysis of annual maximum flows is used to demonstrate that this assumption is invalid and that Q(100)/Q(2) ratios vary substantially with basin area and climate. For the snowmelt-dominated peak flows in the Columbia and southern Rocky Mountains, Q(100)/Q(2) decreases slightly with increasing drainage area, from 2.3 (1 km(2)) to 1.9 (100 km(2)). For the flood peaks generated by rainfall and rain on snow in coastal BC, this range is 3.1-2.6. In the semi-arid Interior Plateau region, variability in Q(100)/Q(2) ratios is most dramatic. For a 10-km(2) basin, the calculated Q(100)/Q(2) ratio of 4.9 is 1.6 times the assumed factor of 3, while for a 1-km(2) basin Q(100)/Q(2) is 7.5 or 2.5 times this factor. Underestimating Q(100)/Q(2) may lead to underdesign and early failure of road culverts, and therefore, current FPC guidelines for estimating the 100-year instantaneous flood may have serious adverse economic and environmental consequences in small Interior Plateau watersheds.

AB  - Domestic cats (Felis catus) face contradictory public perceptions. In 2019, we examined public perceptions toward cats within the City of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, using an online survey (1,464 responses) to assess perceptions toward free-roaming cats and the use of bylaws to address concerns. Perceptions were dependent on cat-ownership status; a majority of non-cat and former owners were concerned about free-roaming cats, current cat owners less so. There was considerable support for mandatory identification. Cat owners were not supportive of bylaws restricting free-roaming of cats, although this was supported by non-owners. Concerns include the negative impact on caring for a pet cat, and the fear that such bylaws would increase abandonment. Cat owners were not enthusiastic about fines for roaming cats, while non-cat owners were. There was considerable concern around including neutering cats as part of planned cat management. Our research also found nuanced concern for the impacts of management on impoverished owners, the welfare of cats and a recognition that it was the humans, rather than the cats, who should be the focus of active and thoughtful intervention.

AB  - Mineralized occurrences of Hg in bedrock are abundant along Pinchi Fault, in north central British Columbia, two of which have been mined in the early to mid 20th century. Distribution patterns of mercury concentrations measured in the clay sized fraction (< 2 mu m) of till reveal anomalous levels on and down-ice from the fault Mercury in the till is interpreted to be of detrital origin. In other words, during glaciation, glacier ice eroded bedrock and older sediments enriched in mercury and transported them in a down-ice direction, finally depositing the sediment load at a distance from the source. Consequently, the area with anomalous mercury concentrations in the till is several orders of magnitude larger than the area of mercury mineralization in bedrock.

AB  - Previous research has highlighted the relationship between snow accumulation and forest stand characteristics, as well as the effects of topography, but not the variability within stands. This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

AB  - British Columbia Holocene vegetation and climate is reconstructed from pollen records. A coastal Pinus contorta paleobiome developed after glacier retreat under cool and probably dry climate. Cool moist forests involving Picea, Abies, Tsuga spp., and Pinus followed until the early Holocene. Pseudotsuga menziesii arrived and spread in the south 10 000-9000 BP, and Picea sitchensis - Tsuga heterophylla forests developed in the north. T. heterophylla increased 7500-7000 BP, and Cupressaceae expanded 5000-4000 BP. Bogs began to develop and expland. Modern vegetation arose 4000-2000 BP. There were early Holocene grass and Artemisia communities at mid-elevations and pine stands at high elevations in southern interior B.C. Forests expanded downslope and lakes formed 8500-7000 BP. Modern forests arose 4500-4000 BP while lower and upper tree lines declined. In northern B.C. non-arboreal communities preceded middle Holocene Picea forests. Abies, Pinus and Picea mariana predominated at various sites after 4000 BP. At 6000 BP Tsuga heterophylla (south) and Picea sitchensis (north) dominated the coast and islands and Quercus garryana and Pseudotsuga on southeast Vancouver Island, but Thuja plicata was infrequent. Southern Interior Plateau Vegetation at 6000 BP was more open than today at middle to lower elevations, whereas forests covered the Northern interior Plateau. Picea forests occurred in northern B.C. Holocene climate phases were : 1) warm dry ''xerothermic'' ca. 9500-7000 BP, 2) warm moist ''mesothermic'' ca. 7000-4500 BP, 3) moderate and moist 4500-0 BP, with increasing moisture 8500-6000 BP and cooling (?increased moisture) 4500-3000 BP. B.C.'s Hypsithermal had dry and wet stages; 6000 BP occurred in the warm and wet mesothermic stage.

AB  - Upper Paleozoic to Lower Jurassic oceanic rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane near Fort St. James, in central British Columbia, form a stack of thrust sheets cut by steeply dipping strike-slip faults. Paleontologically dated upper Paleozoic strata include bioclastic shallow-water limestone and ribbon chert. Isotopically dated Permian rocks consist of tonalite sills and stocks and rhyolite flows intercalated with basalt flows. Paleontologically dated lower Mesozoic rocks include greywacke, sandstone, siltstone, argillite, ribbon chert, conglomerate, limestone, and basalt tuff. Trembleur Ultramafite unit of the Cache Creek Complex, in places part of an ophiolite suite, forms thrust sheets and klippen that overlie lower Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. Sedimentological, lithochemical, paleontological, petrological, and textural comparisons with other areas and established models demonstrate that Cache Creek Terrane is an accretionary complex, a structurally stacked assemblage of rocks that originated in diverse and disparate oceanic paleoenvironments. These environments include spreading ridge, oceanic plateau, atoll, trench fill, and possibly arc. Internal imbrication of the terrane is as young as Early Jurassic, as determined from fossil evidence, and the minimum age of obduction of the thrust stack westward onto Stikine Terrane is Middle Jurassic, as determined from dating of a crosscutting pluton. Triassic blueschist and eclogite of Cache Creek Terrane are interpreted to have been primarily uplifted to upper crustal levels during Triassic subduction. Cache Creek Terrane, as a remnant of that subduction process, and caught in the collision between Stikine and Quesnel terranes, marks the position of a lithosphere-scale suture zone, the Pinchi Suture.

AB  - We present two mutually contradictory hypotheses for the mid- and Late Cretaceous paleogeography of the western margin of North America. In Hypothesis A, representative of a family of models based on geologic evidence, the Insular and Intermontane superterranes and the Intervening mid-Cretaceous Coast Mountains orogen were situated in their present positions relative to cratonic North America, 90 my ago. In the alternative Hypothesis B, based on paleomagnetic data, the Insular superterrane and the Coast Mountains orogen along: its eastern edge were situated 3000 km south of their present positions, 90 my ago. This crustal element, Baja British Columbia, then moved northward between 90 and 70 Ma along the hypothetical, coast-parallel, Baja B.C. fault system. At 70 Ma, Baja British Columbia was Juxtaposed with the western part of the Intermontane superterrane, which lay 1100 km south of its present position. Between 70 and 50 Ma, the composite block moved northward an additional 1100 km along the hypothetical Intra-Quesnellia fault, located within the Intermontane superterrane. A goal of the hypothetico-deductive scientific method is the elimination of false hypotheses using empirical tests. A review of the logical arguments governing this method shows that if two contradictory hypotheses are judged to have non-negligible prior probabilities-if both have a significant likelihood of being true-then a crucial test can potentially lead to the refutation of one hypothesis and provide empirical support for the alternative. A crucial test is possible when an observational prediction of one model is prohibited by an alternative model. To evaluate whether hypothesis A or B can be ruled out by geologic evidence, we propose four crucial tests independent of paleomagnetic tests. To test the Baja British Columbia hypothesis, potentially useful geologic evidence includes: (1) the provenance of detritus in mid-Cretaceous strata in the Methow and Tyaughton basins; (2) the provenance of detritus in pre-late Campanian strata in the Nanaimo Group; (3) offset geologic features in BaJa British Columbia matching counterparts in southwestern California and northwestern Mexico; and (4) Late Cretaceous or older geologic features limiting offset across the transcurrent Baja B.C. fault to < 1000 km.

AB  - This paper discusses local understanding of plants and habitats, based on the linguistic evidence [terms for plants and (or) habitats] gathered from ethnobotanical and ethnoecological field work conducted with several Dene Nations of the Canadian northwestern boreal forest and adjacent regions. Nations involved in the study include Gwich' in (Mackenzie Delta Region), Sahtu otine' (Great Bear Lake), Kaska Dena (southern Yukon), and Witsuwit'en (northwest British Columbia). Key plant-related habitats include meadow, "swamp", forest, "willows", and "brush". The ethnobotanical classification of willows is explored in conjunction with the explanation of the Dene habitat concept. In local classifications, 'willow' is not co-extensive with the genus Salix, but includes a variety of medium to tall woody shrubs that lack either conspicuous flowers, 'berries', or thorns; these may include shrubby species of Salix, Alnus, Cornus, and Betula. Shoreline and alpine environments are also discussed as plant habitats. Dene use of alpine environments and resources is ancient, according to the results of recent alpine ice patch research in the Yukon region. The Human dimensions of habitat knowledge are presented. Indigenous concepts of plant taxa and of landscape associations or habitats may differ substantially from those of scientific botany and ecology, and are based in a holistic and interactive ethnoecology.

AB  - Forestry activities are globally widespread and can have a large positive or negative influence on wildlife. Wildlife responses to forestry cutblocks (defined areas where trees were harvested) vary as a function of forest succession, which differs across systems. Across their distribution, moose (Alces alces) and forestry are often closely associated. Moose are predicted to select for cutblocks because of greater browse quantity in early successional vegetation, but moose responses to cutblocks are inconsistent across studies. Our objective was to compare moose spatial responses to cutblocks as a function of year since cut between study areas (Prince George South [PGS] and Bonaparte [BP]) while considering differences in vegetation composition and regrowth to better inform forestry planning in British Columbia, Canada. We characterized cutblocks by dominant tree species as a proxy for vegetation composition and estimated the normalized burn ratio (NBR) from multispectral satellite imagery as an index of vegetation regrowth (i.e., structure). We then examined the use of cutblocks by moose dependent upon vegetation composition and NBR using generalized additive mixed effects models. Next, we used locations of collared moose and nearby available locations to examine moose responses as a function of year since cut and used those responses to group cutblocks into age classes, which were incorporated into resource selection functions (RSF) to compare moose responses between study areas. Vegetation composition differed between study areas, and although cutblocks in both study areas followed similar regrowth trajectories, NBRs for cutblocks > 13 years post-logging in PGS exceeded those in BP. Moose demonstrated greater use of locations within cutblocks with intermediate NBRs and dominanted by spruce (Picea engelmannii x glauca) versus Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca). Moose responses as a function of year since cut varied seasonally, but across seasons, moose tended to avoid new cutblocks (1-8 years), select for regenerating cutblocks (9-24 years), and avoid older cutblocks (25-40 years). In both study areas, RSFs revealed that moose avoided new cutblocks, but moose in PGS were more likely to select for regenerating cutblocks in comparison to BP. Our analyses suggest that the use of cutblocks by moose is a function of year since cut, vegetation composition, and vegetation regrowth, likely resulting from differences in browse quantity and lateral cover. To maintain stable moose populations, managers should consider vegetation composition and regrowth during forestry planning, and future research should focus on identifying region-specific forestry thresholds for moose.

AB  - The genus Drosera (sundews) is represented in British Columbia (BC), Canada, by Drosera rotundifolia (L.), Drosera anglica (Huds.), and their hybrid Drosera x obovata (Mert. & W.D.J. Koch). All three can be found in Sphagnum bogs of central BC, including those within the Aleza Lake Research Forest (ALRF) located 60 km east of Prince George. Vegetation patterns in bogs are known to be correlated with light, water, and nutrient gradients, and despite information being available on the influence of light and water on Drosera occurrence, little information is known about the role of nutrients. Here, we focused on a bog containing all three Drosera species, to determine whether nutrient levels are related to the abundance of the widespread species, D. rotundifolia. Univariate regression tree analysis between soil water chemistry and D. rotundifolia numbers indicates that D. rotundifolia is a calcifuge, preferring moderately acidic soil pH (>5.5) and relatively low calcium levels (<2.88 ppm). This study provides evidence that high soil water calcium and low pH limit the growth of D. rotundifolia in field populations. The physiology underlying this preference, how this is affected by hybridization between other sundew species, and how this mineralogical limitation interacts with other niche-defining factors to dictate the occurrence of D. rotundifolia are questions that remain to be answered.

AB  - Paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) is an ecologically valuable and suitable new reforestation species in British Columbia (BC). An understanding of birch's genecology is important to deploy it successfully. Eighteen paper birch populations (49-558 degrees N) were collected from five distinct geographic regions in BC to determine whether observed variability in spring bud phenology was due to genetics, the growing environment or their interaction. Seedlings were grown at three common gardens in Prince George (53 degrees 45'N), Salmon Arm (50 degrees 47'N) and Victoria (48 degrees 29'N) to observe the bud break. Further a controlled photoperiod, a root zone temperature and a translocation experiment from the northern to central garden were conducted to investigate the effect of photoperiod and root temperature on birch bud break. Results revealed that timing of spring bud phenology in paper birch is under genetic and environmental control, following climatic clines based on latitude from south to north. Bud flush at the southern common garden was on an average 25 days earlier and required 177 more growing degree day than the northern common garden. Conversely, our controlled experiments and seed source translocation experiment showed that the signal for the onset of spring bud flush is controlled by air temperature, soil temperature, and photoperiod. These results allow us to characterize spring budburst phenology of paper birch and begin to consider seed zones and seed zone transfer guidelines for BC.

AB  - The maintenance, protection, and conservation of forest genetic resources for economic, ecological and social benefits are daunting tasks. Understanding how reforestation materials are spatially and temporally deployed across the landscape is an integral component of forest genetic resources management. To improve the current understanding of how reforestation materials are deployed in British Columbia (BC), we developed a geographical information systems (GIS) method to track seed deployment across silviculture openings. Generally, reforestation materials can originate from either natural stand (wild seed collections) or orchards' seed sources (improved seed); the latter are produced within the framework of specific tree improvement program designed for a particular species within a well-defined seed deployment area, commonly known as Seed Planning Zone (SPZ). In this paper, we present a GIS-based method for evaluating seed deployment patterns for interior spruce (Picea glauca and Picea engelmannii and their natural hybrids) within the Prince George SPZ. The evaluation period (1970-2004) is associated with wild stands and improved seed availability and the dynamic of each seed source proportionate contribution followed three distinct phases; namely, developing (1970-1987), immature (1988-1994), and mature (1995-2004) with a progressive increase of orchards' seed use over time. The developed method is scalable across SPZs of the same species or multiple species, thus providing the means to: 1) temporally and spatially monitor improved and natural stands seed deployment over the landscape; and 2) identify areas of concerns where a particular seed source is over-represented which might pose an increased genetic vulnerability. The present study revealed that the current interior spruce orchard's seed use within the Prince George SPZ is expected to exceed the provincial goal of performance target of 75% by 2014. Additionally, areas of excessive use of one seed orchard seed were identified.

AB  - Volumes of erosional and depositional landforms were estimated by reconnaissance methods in a steep, forested drainage basin in the Coast Mountains, British Columbia, to examine what insight might be gained into the sediment budget in the absence of direct measurements of sediment transfer processes. Sediment transfers in postglacial and contemporary time were inferred on hillslopes, from hillslopes to stream channels, and within stream channels. Data were collected by aerial photographic analysis and field observation. Postglacial sediment sources are major gullies created by debris slides and flows, failures in glaciolacustrine terraces, and stream channel degradation. Depositional landforms consist of talus slopes and colluvial and alluvial fans. Contemporary sediment sources include debris slides and flows in established gullies and minor processes on hillslopes. Debris slide and debris flow volumes were calculated, and other processes were estimated from regional values. Erosion rate averaged over postglacial time is 276 t.km(-2). a(-1) (0.15 mm.a(-1) surface lowering), with gullies and stream channel degradation contributing 170 and 82 t.km(-2)-a(-1), respectively. A terminal alluvial fan provides an independent check of the results. In contemporary time, erosion rates are calculated to be 350 t-km(-2). a(-1), with debris flows and slides contributing nearly all of this sediment. The contemporary rate is probably perturbed by recent land use history. Mass-movement processes appear to be the dominant mechanism of sediment transfer and, contributions from Pleistocene valley deposits have declined significantly during Holocene time.

AB  - This paper analyses the use of fringe financial institutions (FFIs), such as payday loan and check cashing providers, by urban Aboriginal people based on a survey undertaken in Prince George, British Columbia. We found that 60% of FFIs' clients surveyed self-identified as Aboriginal. Their characteristics, compared to the non-Aboriginal FFI clients, included having lower average incomes, lower levels of education, more likely to be female, a higher incidence of being unemployed, higher levels of financial exclusion, and less satisfaction with the service provided by FFIs. We find that government policy towards regulating the FFI industry is inadequate for meeting the basic financial needs of urban Aboriginal people. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thirty years of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) are dynamically downscaled to an 8-km grid spacing using the Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS) to generate a climatology of glacier winter accumulation over the southern Coast Mountains in British Columbia (BC), Canada. RAMS precipitation fields are bias corrected using observations from Environment Canada (EC) synoptic and climate stations and BC provincial snow pillow stations. Raw and bias-corrected model output is compared with observations from EC Reference Climate Network stations, BC provincial Ministry of Transportation and Highways stations, BC Hydro stations, snow course data, and glacier mass balance studies. A water balance is also applied to 12 drainage basins located within the modeling domain to test the consistency of both the raw and bias-corrected precipitation fields with observed streamflow. Model output is compared with the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and bias-corrected NARR. Isotropic spectral power densities are examined to compare the effective spatial resolution of the various precipitation fields. The spatial distribution of the bias-correction field suggests that RAMS underpredicts precipitation on the western edge of Vancouver Island, Canada, and overpredicts along the southern Coast Mountains. The bias correction helps close the water balance budgets in all basins except the Somass on Vancouver Island. The bias correction generally improves the agreement between RAMS and observed snow water equivalent amounts at the glacier and snow course sites, and observed precipitation amounts at the synoptic, climate, and snow pillow stations. The RAMS and NARR isotropic spectral power densities show a loss of variability at approximately 45 and 63 km, while PRISM shows little falloff down to 16 km.

AB  - Orographic precipitation over interior mountains has resulted in the formation of the inland temperate rainforest, where certain stands are potentially antique and support a rich flora of epiphytic macrolichens. We documented macrolichen diversity across three age-classes in forests of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone (i.e., ICHwk3 subzone) east of Prince George, British Columbia. Our objectives were to report changes in lichen communities with stand age, identify potential indicators of antiquity, and investigate the functional role of dominant species in the ecosystem. We identified 41 taxa, including 4 alectorioid lichens, 21 foliose chlorolichens, and 16 old-growth-associated chlorolichens and cyanolichens. Older forests supported more species than young or mature forests. The abundance of Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. was strongly correlated with this increase in diversity and may therefore be an appropriate indicator of stand age in the ICH. The increase in L. pulmonaria and other N-2-fixing cyanolichens with stand age may have significant implications for forest nitrogen budgets in the interior of British Columbia, where atmospheric nitrogen deposition is relatively low and biological N-2 fixation accounts for nearly all of the nitrogen lost to forest harvesting. We hope that this greater understanding of lichen ecology across age-classes will promote sustainable stewardship of the remaining old-growth forests of inland British Columbia.

AB  - Lawsonite eclogites from Pinchi Lake, British Columbia. occur as tectonic blocks associated with lawsonite, aragonite, and jadeite-bearing blueschists. One tectonic block from Tezzeron Lake shows extensive lower-temperature retrogression. The block from Beaver Lake Road (BLR) shows less retrogression and the garnet crystals contain abundant inclusions of lawsonite and omphacite suggesting these minerals were stable throughout most of the crystallization history. Compositional profiles and element maps of garnets show: (1) Mn enrichment in cores with decrease toward rims; (2) little change in Ca from core to rim: (3) general decrease in Fe/Mg from Core to rim. Phase diagram sections for sample BLR-3 and garnet-core compositions suggest garnet-core growth at 505 degrees C and 24.3 kbar (1 kbar = 0.1 GPa). Temperature estimates based upon garnet-clinopyroxene Fe-Mg exchange geothermometry are, for inclusions in garnet at 25 kbar, 450 +/- 30 degrees C (4 spots); 435 +/- 15 (10); and 445 +/- 25 (6). For garnet rims and matrix clinopyroxene the results are: 515 +/- 50 degrees C (2): 440 +/- 25 (5); 475 +/- 20 (2). These results suggest very little if any statistically significant changes in temperature during crystal growth. Estimates of pressure are based upon several different calibrations of the garnet-clinopyroxene-phengite equilibria. Using the calibration of Krogh-Ravna we obtain pressures of: 24.2-26.8 kbar, compatible with that estimated for garnet-core growth in BLR-3. For the glaucophane = talc + jadeite geobarometer. the activity relations for glaucophane are not well constrained. At 450 degrees C a pressure of 26 kbar is calculated (one sample). A pressure of 25 kbarat 450 degrees C suggests depths of similar to 90 km, leading to a P-T gradient of similar to 5 degrees C km(-1). This gradient passes through the inferred stability field of lawsonite eclogites and the calculated stability fields of lawsonite for Pinchi Lake samples. This is very near the P-T stability field of coesite, which is characteristic of Ultra-High-Pressure metamorphism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: With the increased development of distributed sites for medical education across Canada, it is imperative we ensure that the quality of education is comparable between the different campuses. Our objective was to assess medical student experience and comfort with common urologic clinical encounters and to determine whether any differences exist between the distributed education sites at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Methods: Questionnaires assessing urologic education were delivered simultaneously to all final-year UBC medical students attending campuses in Vancouver, Victoria and Prince George. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Overall, 55.8% of students felt their exposure to urology was adequate in the medical curriculum; learners in the Northern Program (Prince George) ranked their clinical and didactic experiences significantly higher. Areas requiring improvement include teaching of the male genitourinary exam, digital rectal exam and sexual history, in which learners rated teaching "good/outstanding" in only 18.2%, 47.7% and 43.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, students were most comfortable with the following clinical encounters: urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hematuria, incontinence and prostate cancer. Few differences in student experience or comfort were noted related to campus site, gender or urology clerkship exposure. Conclusion: A significant minority of learners perceived that they had inadequate exposure to urology in the undergraduate curriculum. Experience in urology was comparable across the distributed sites and was congruent with teaching objectives. Students were comfortable with the clinical scenarios deemed most important in the literature. Learners in the Northern Program were significantly more satisfied with their urologic teaching, which potentially highlights the advantages of learning in a smaller academic setting.

AB  - Sediments deposited in Moose Lake, British Columbia exhibit three abrupt transitions during the Holocene. Basal diamicts are unconformably overlain by coarse sand and silt deposited as turbidity currents in an ice-dammed lake during final retreat of Wisconsinan ice. Rapid withdrawal of the valley glacier resulted in a fully developed Moose Lake followed by low rates of sediment input for much of the early and middle Holocene until approximately 4,100 years BP. At that time, sediment input doubled and then tripled by 3,120 years BP in response to cooling and several phases of regionally documented glacier expansions. The transition from the Altithermal dry/warm period to the Neoglacial cooling is coincident with the formation of varves at Moose Lake which provide a chronology of changing Neoglacial sediment inputs. The glacier-climate signal recorded in Moose Lake sediments suggests distinct thresholds for changes in sedimentation style that are dependent on both climatic and geomorphic conditions affecting the watershed. Early in the record, direct connection to glaciogenic sediment production produced highly variable sedimentation rates that ended abruptly as the ice-front retreated. In the middle record, climate conditions that led to greatly reduced ice extent and lower sediment production in the upper Fraser and Moose river watersheds, changed abruptly resulting in varve formation. The change in style and increased sedimentation was caused directly by greater seasonal variations in sediment input due to climate-controlled glacier advances beyond modern limits. While sediment supply is a factor, comparison of the sediment record with tree-ring responses to climate change suggest both summer temperature and winter precipitation are important controls of Holocene variations in sediment yield.

AB  - In response to ongoing and future-projected global warming, mid-latitude, nival river basins are expected to transition from a snowmelt-dominated flow regime to a nival-pluvial one with an earlier spring freshet of reduced magnitude. There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically down-scaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations. Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoff changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin increases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the basin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the anticipated transition from a nival to a nival-pluvial hydrologic regime, the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5 models, providing in-sights for other maritime-influenced extratropical basins.

AB  - The Cariboo placer mining district (1000 km(2)) sited in the Interior Plateau of central British Columbia, Canada, is the premier placer gold mining district of the Province. Gold is recovered from three Late Pleistocene sedimentary facies: postglacial fluvial gravels (< 10 Ka), Late Wisconsin till(ca. 25-10 Ka), and ''older'' fluvial gravels(> 25 Ka). This study reports the morphology (size, roundness, sphericity) of 1636 gold grains, ranging in size from 0.25 to 17 mm, recovered from 19 placer mines. Older gravels contain the smallest gold grains (mean grain size 1.53 mm), grains of intermediate size occur in till (2.23 mm) and the coarsest gold occurs in postglacial gravels (2.34 mm) with a mean of 1.93 mm for the mining district as a whole. The most common grain shapes are sub-rounded, discoidal (14.73% of the grain population), sub-angular, discoidal (10.88%), and sub-rounded, sub-discoidal (9.59%); the most angular grains occur in postglacial gravels. In-situ growth of coarse, angular grains is indicated by a ''composite'' grain structure, consisting of aggregates of gold particles welded together by high-grade (Ag = < 2%) filamentous gold; in-situ coarsening may be reliant on organic complexing agents produced below a dense forest cover. An evolutionary sequence of grain form, from angular aggregates to rounded ''pumpkin seed'' grains, is suggested. Rounded grains commonly show a crystalline structure which may result from the cold hammering of gold during transport; fracturing along crystal boundaries is common. Gold grains may undergo cycles of coarsening, rounding, diagenesis and breakup in response to repeated recycling through Pleistocene sedimentary environments.

AB  - Mercury and Sb in soils (humus, B horizon, C horizon) and environmental biomonitors (moss and epiphytic lichen) were examined near two past-producing Hg, mines located in British Columbia, Canada: Pinchi Lake and Bralorne Takla mines. Sequential extraction analyses and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the chemical associations of Hg and Sb and the mineralogical forms of Hg in soils. Mercury and Sb in the C horizon are derived mostly from natural sources because their concentrations are controlled by the bedrock geology, glacial transport, and sediment types. Distribution of Sb in the B horizon is similar to that of the C horizon suggesting, a common geogenic source. Mercury in the B horizon at Pinchi Lake mine could be derived in part from anthropogenic sources,. because (1) only at that site, and not at any other sites of cinnabar occurrences in bedrock, is there a labile Hg enrichment in the B compared to the C horizon, and (2) there is a weak correlation between non-labile Hg concentrations in the B horizon and distance from the mine which occurs independently of the natural concentrations of the C horizon. Mercury and Sb concentrations in humus near Pinchi Lake mine (<10 km) appear to be derived in part from anthropogenic sources because there are strong correlations between labile and non-labile He, and Sb concentrations with distance from the mine which occurs independently of natural concentrations in the C horizon. Near Pinchi Lake mine, biogeochemical cycling and gaseous Hg derived from the substrate are thought to be minimal pathways and sources of Hg to the humus compared to anthropogenic sources, otherwise the strong Ha enrichment in the humus compared to the C horizon only observed near Pinchi Lake mine would also be present at several sites of cinnabar occurrences in bedrock along Pinchi Fault. Anthropogenic Ho, and Sb enrichment in the soils near Bralorne Takla mine is indistinguishable from natural enrichment. Mercury and Sb levels In the sampled moss and lichen species reflect locally derived wind-borne sod and rock dust.

AB  - Francois Lake is a long, deep, seasonally ice-covered, dimictic lake set in an east-west orientation in mid-British Columbia. As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?).

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the extent to which social factors are influential in determining women's access to cancer screening services in Prince George, British Columbia. Specifically, this study evaluated the association of age, income, education, work status, disability, marital status, and immigrant status with previous use of screening mammography and Pap tests. Data was obtained from the 1994 National Population Health Survey, which contains a sample of 416 women from the Prince George area. A series of logistic regression analyses were used to distinguish ever versus never been screened as well as recency of previous screening. Participation rates in screening mammography in Prince George are comparatively high; however, no association was found between social factors and previous mammography use. This suggests women in Prince George are participating in mammography services regardless of social background. Participation rates in Pap test screening in Prince George are high and are similar to provincial averages; however, while a large percentage of women have been screened, this percentage varies across social groups. Immigrant women, single women, and women with less education are over represented among women who have never had a Pap test. In addition, older women are less likely to obtain a recent Pap test when compared to younger women. This study suggests that certain groups of women in northern British Columbia experience low participation in health services, resulting in a higher risk for poor health and a poor quality of life.

AB  - Major and trace element petrochemistry has been determined for forty-six Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rocks representing the Mt. Milligan and Chuchi porphyry Cu-Au deposits, marginal phases of the Hogem Batholith, and Takla Group volcanic rocks. Monzonites and latites of the Mt. Milligan deposit have undergone moderate to strong potassic alteration, principally involving the addition of K-feldspar and biotite. They are characterized by high K2O (5-13 wt.%), low Sr (180-450 ppm), high LOI (3-7 wt.%), slight to moderate LREE enrichment (La(N)/SM(N) = 3.9, n = 5 for monzonites, La(N)/Sm(N) = 2.4, n = 5 for volcanic rocks); but have non-diagnostic compatible trace element, HREE and HFSE contents in comparison to less altered rocks in the region. Samples taken peripheral to the Chuchi deposit have undergone moderate potassic (K-feldspar) alteration. They have slightly enriched K2O (4-6 wt.%) and LREE (La(N)/Sm(N) = 3.0, n = 4 for monzonites; La(N)/Sm(N) = 2.7, n = 4 for volcanic rocks), but otherwise are similar to less-altered rocks nearby. An alteration index: K2O x 100/Sr, distinguishes mineralized from barren samples in this suite, with mineralized samples having values greater than unity. The entire suite has petrochemical characteristics of a shoshonitic arc suite, with relatively high alkalis (5-15 wt.%) over mafic to intermediate SiO2 contents (44-66 wt.%) and Mg numbers (48-77); accompanied by moderate LREE enrichment, low TiO2 (less than 1.1 wt.%), and low Ta (less than 1 ppm, n = 8) and Nb (all but one less than 20 ppm) contents. The volcanic rocks are comparable to broadly coeval shoshonites found elsewhere in Quesnellia and Stikinia, including in the Nicola and Stuhini Groups of southwestern and northern British Columbia, respectively. By comparison with the porphyry gold-bearing Tabir-Feni shoshonitic volcanic arc, and other porphyry Cu-Au-bearing arcs of the southwest Pacific, and considering regional tectonic features, the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rocks of central Quesnellia may have formed as a result of arc reversal, with subduction of the adjacent Cache Creek and Slide Mountain oceanic terranes under the Quesnellia volcanic arc from the west and east, respectively.

AB  - Stand susceptibility to defoliation by spruce budworm, Choristoneura fumiferana (Clem.), was examined in the: Fort Nelson area of the Prince George Forest Region of British Columbia. In a retrospective study, defoliation maps of the study area were overlaid onto British Columbia Ministry of Forests cover type maps using a geographic information system. Analysis of the combined data identified forest characteristics associated with increased susceptibility to defoliation by spruce budworm. These were stands where the leading species was white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). or where spruce was associated with aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. balsamifera L.) in mixed stands. Susceptibility to defoliation also was related to site quality, level of crown closure and stand age. Spruce stands on medium quality sites (site index 15 to 25 m, at reference breast height age 50 years) were more susceptible than stands on both poor- and high-quality sites. When spruce was mixed with aspen, stands on higher quality sites were more susceptible to budworm attack than poor sites. open stands, where crown closure was <50%, were more susceptible to attack by spruce budworm than closed canopy stands. Older stands (120-199 years) were more susceptible to budworm attack than younger stands (40-110 years). In defoliated plots monitored for 6 years, tree mortality and top-kill reached a maximum of 30.4 and 47.2%, respectively. The losses varied with level of defoliation and were reduced by applications of the biological pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis. Crown Copyright <(c)> 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Background: Indigenous leaders continue to be concerned about high rates of HIV and barriers to HIV treatment among young Indigenous people involved in substance use. Growing evidence suggests that using mobile phones for health (mHealth) may be a powerful way to support connection with health services, including HIV prevention and treatment. Objective: This study examined the patterns of mobile phone ownership and use among young Indigenous people who have used drugs living with or vulnerable to HIV and explored the acceptability of mHealth to support access to health care in this population. Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Indigenous people who have used drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. This mixed methods exploratory study involved 131 Cedar Project participants enrolled in our WelTel mHealth program. At enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire related to mobile phone use and interest in mHealth. Data were linked to Cedar Project questionnaires and serodata. We present comparative statistics (quantitative) and results of a rapid thematic analysis (qualitative) related to mobile phone patterns and interest in receiving mHealth. Results: Less than half of the participants (59/130; 45.4%) reported owning a phone. Among those with a phone, the majority owned a smartphone (46/59; 78%). Most participants with a phone reported having an unlimited texting plan (39/55; 71%), using the internet on their phone (44/59; 75%), and texting daily (44/55; 80%). A majority reported that using a mobile phone for health would be invaluable (120/130; 92.3%). There were no differences in mHealth acceptance between participants who owned a phone and those who did not (P>.99). All but one participant living with HIV felt using a mobile phone would be helpful for their health, while a small proportion of HIV-negative participants remained unsure (1.9% vs 11.7%; P=.047). In response to open-ended questions asking why using a mobile phone may be helpful for health, participants identified a diverse set of anticipated benefits: (1) connection for emotional, mental, and spiritual support, (2) connection to family, (3) staying in touch and/or being reachable, (4) overcoming current barriers to phone use, (5) convenience, privacy, and safety, and (6) access to health care and emergency services. Conclusions: We observed high acceptance and interest in using mobile phone technology for health despite low rates of personal mobile phone connectivity among young Indigenous people who have used drugs living with and vulnerable to HIV in British Columbia, Canada. Mobile phones were viewed as a way to support connections and relationships that are seen as critical to health and well-being among young Indigenous people in this study Findings may be useful for health care providers preparing to scale up mHealth programs to support HIV prevention and treatment in this population.

AB  - Precise Re-Os molybdenite ages for the Endako porphyry molybdenum deposit and the Nithi Mountain occurrence, British Columbia, Canada, yield new information on the timing of molybdenite deposition. Three episodes of mineralization are indicated: (1) similar to 154 Ma, (2) similar to 148 to 146 Ma, and (3) similar to 145 Ma. Re-Os dates agree well with new U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar data from granitoids of the Nithi phase (155.2 +/- 1.5 Ma), the Endako phase (148.4 +/- 1.5 Ma), and a preore dike (147.4 +/- 0.6 Ma), and the Casey phase (145.1 +/- 0.2. Ma), plus hydrothermal biotite (144.5 +/- 0.75 Ma; Villeneuve et al.,2001). The excellent correlation between die Re-Os dates from molybdenite and the ages of granitoids from the area indicates a direct genetic relationship between these plutons and molybdenite mineralization. These Re-Os data also provide further insight into the systematics and robustness of Re-Os in molybdenite. The Endako molybdenum deposit is tl-le product of two episodes of mineralization, both associated with moderate-salinity (5-15 wt % NaCl equiv) and high-temperature (similar to 440 degreesC) fluids; a third low-temperature (190 degrees -300 degreesC) hydrothermal event is associated with Eocene faulting (Selby et al., 2000). The clear distinction between two of the Re-Os molybdenite dates in the deposit and the close agreement of these dates to the ages of granitoid intrusions suggest that the Re-Os system in molybdenite is not reset by high-temperature (similar to 440 degreesC), moderate-salinity hydrothermal fluids. In contrast, magmatic biotite in a similar to 147 Ma preore dike has a (40)/Ar/39Ar age of similar to 145 Ma, identical to the age of the hydrothermal biotite, indicating that similar to 440 degreesC fluids reset the Ar-Ar system in biotite. Hence, we interpret that the Re-Os isotope system in molybdenite is resistant to resetting by high-temperature fluids (similar to 440 degreesC), in contrast to the 40Ar/39Ar system in biotite. The Re-Os system in molybdenite is also unaffected by postore hydrothermal fluids. These data show that molybdenite can provide critical information in understanding sulfide mineral deposition in ore systems, which is not recorded by other isotopic systems in alteration minerals.

AB  - Lengthy records of river discharge are necessary to comprehensively assess the long-term connection between synoptic climate forcings and nival-regime systems in British Columbia. A regional multispecies network of tree-ring width and ring density chronologies was built for west central British Columbia with the intention of dendrohydrologically extending short runoff records in this area. Extended records of July-August mean discharge anomalies for the Skeena and Atnarko Rivers were reconstructed back to AD 1660. Low flow events represented during the late 1600s, early 1700s and late 1800s lie beyond those experienced during the recent instrumental period for these basins. The documentation of extreme events of this magnitude necessitates consideration when planning for future water resources in this region. Supplementary dendroclimatic reconstructions of the winter Pacific North American (PNA) pressure anomaly pattern and records of mean summer temperature and end-of-winter snow water equivalent were also constructed. These ancillary climate records provide insight into the long-term climate drivers of annual discharge dynamics within these nival basins. Correlation and wavelet analyses confirm the persistent relationship of synoptic climate regimes described by the Southern Oscillation Index, NINO 3.4, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and PNA indices on runoff in west central British Columbia.

AB  - At two sites in central British Columbia, sediments with dispersed organic matter, underneath Fraser Glaciation deposits, are interpreted as nonglacial deposits of Middle Wisconsinan age (Olympia Nonglacial Interval). At Necoslie River, undated sand with dispersed organic matter, thought to be fluvial in origin, is overlain by Fraser drift. At Nautley River, similar sand contains plant detritus that has yielded C-14 ages of 38 230 +/- 410 BP (Beta-88557) and 42460 +/- 670 BP (Beta-88558). Pollen assemblages of the sediments with dispersed organic matter at the Necoslie River and Nautley River sites are similar: both assemblages are dominated by herb pollen, with a lesser amount of tree pollen. The pollen assemblages are thought to reflect a tundra-type vegetation. Because vegetation in the area is presently dominated by spruce and subalpine fir forest, climate during deposition probably was much cooler than today. Data presented here support the contention of other studies in western Canada that cooler climatic conditions existed for some time during the Middle Wisconsinan.

AB  - This study was conducted to find wood quality evidence of hybridization between jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in northeast British Columbia (BC). To determine if wood and fiber traits could be used as distinguishing features among jack pine, lodgepole pine, and their hybrids. differences in morphology and wood and fiber traits were related to the genetic identity of each sample. Thirty samples each Of pure lodgepole pine, pure jack pine, and potential hybrids were collected from the Prince George area of BC, the Smoky Lake area of Alberta, and the Fort Nelson region of BC. respectively. Two 10-mm cores (bark to bark) were taken from each tree and analyzed for fiber length and coarseness, microfibril angle (MFA), basic density, early wood:latewood ratios, and cell dimensions. Needle and cone morphology was used to distinguish among Species groups in the field. Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area.

AB  - Dates from lavas associated with tills and erratics indicate that ice-sheet glaciations occurred between 4 and 0.6 Ma BP. The few radiocarbon dates that are available suggest that the chronology of the Late Wisconsinan (Fraser Glaciation) ice sheet of northern British Columbia was similar to that of the southern part of the province. During what may have been a long, early phase of this glaciation, Glacial Lake Stikine was dammed by advancing valley glaciers in the Coast Mountains, and alpine glaciers developed on the intermontane plateau. At the climax of Fraser Glaciation, ice-flow patterns were dominated by outflow from a neve centred over the northern Skeena Mountains. Deglaciation occurred partly by frontal retreat of ice tongues and partly by downwasting of stagnant ice. Recessional moraines mark one or more resurgences or stillstands of the ice margin. During deglaciation, Stikine River valley was occupied by an active outlet glacier and a major subglacial drainage system.

AB  - The Baker Creek watershed (1570 km(2)), situated in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada, has been severely disturbed by both logging and natural disturbance, particularly by a recent large-scale mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestation (up to 2009, 70.2% of the watershed area had been attacked by MPB) and subsequent salvage logging. The concept of equivalent clear-cut area (ECA) was used to indicate the magnitude of forest disturbance, with consideration of hydrological recovery following various types of disturbance (wildfire, logging and MPB infestation), cumulated over space and time in the watershed. The cumulative ECA peaked at 62.2% in 2009. A combined approach of statistical analysis (i.e. time series analysis) and graphic method (modified double mass curve) was employed to evaluate the impacts of forest disturbance on hydrology. Our results showed that severe forest disturbance significantly increased annual mean flow. The average increment in annual mean flow caused by forest disturbance was 48.4 mm yr(-1), while the average decrease in annual mean flow caused by climatic variability during the same disturbance period was 35.5 mm yr(-1). The opposite changes in directions and magnitudes clearly suggest an offsetting effect between forest disturbance and climatic variability, with the absolute influential strength of forest disturbance (57.7%) overriding that from climate variability (42.3%). Forest disturbance also produced significant positive effects on low flow and dry season (fall and winter) mean flow. Implications of our findings for future forest and water resources management are discussed in the context of long-term watershed sustainability.

Unrelated variance in the observed spectral response at mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey points was reduced following image stratification with the GIS forest inventory data and removal of other factors uncharacteristic of Fed-attack damage. Locations of known mountain pine beetle infestation were used to train a maxi. mum-likelihood algorithm; overall classification accuracy was 73 percent, based on an assessment of 360 independent validation points. If local stand variability is reduced prior to signature generation, accuracies and map products can be useful for those involved in active forest management decision-making regarding mountain pine beetle infestations.

AB  - Purpose The urban sedimentary system is attracting increasing interest because of its role in influencing air and water quality. A large amount of road-deposited sediment (RDS) lies on the road network of Prince George, a city of about 80,000 people, in British Columbia, Canada. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the total mass of RDS within the city, and how this varied over time and space; and (2) to determine the temporal and spatial variations in the particle-size fractions of the RDS. Materials and methods Samples of RDS were collected using a grid network during two different time periods in the snow-free season in 2009. Composite samples for each grid (n = 46) were fractionated into five grain-size classes (> 500, 250-500, 125-250, 63-125, < 63 mu m) using stainless steel sieves. Fractionated sediment samples were weighed to obtain a mass for each size class for each grid cell. Results and discussion The total amount of RDS (all particle-size fractions) in the city of Prince George was estimated to be 746 x 10(3) and 204 x 10(3) kg for the summer and fall 2009 sampling periods, respectively. Based on a total road length of 1,030 km within the sampled area of the city, this equates to an average of 724 and 198 kg per km of road, for the summer and fall sampling periods, respectively. The RDS was dominated by the > 500-mu m fraction, and there was a trend of decreasing amounts (by mass) for the finer particle-size fractions. In terms of the most important particle-size fraction from an air and water quality perspective, the < 63-mu m particle-size fraction accounted for, on average, 6.5% and 4.8% of the total RDS mass for the summer and fall 2009 sampling periods, respectively; it is estimated that an additional approximately 2% was lost to the air during sample collection, and thus values may be closer to 9% and 7%, respectively. This equates to averages of between 47-61 and 10-13 kg per km of road for the summer and fall periods, respectively. Total amounts of RDS were greatest in the city centre, compared to the outlying areas, reflecting the greater density of roads in the former, although there were some hotspots which may reflect land use activities such as light-industry and pulp and paper mills. Conclusions These findings have implications for air and water quality in the city and surrounding area, including the role of RDS in contributing to airborne fine particulates (i.e. PM10 and PM2.5) and the fine-grained sediment (< 63 mu m) transported within storm sewers to receiving waterways, such as the Fraser and Nechako Rivers.

AB  - This study investigates geochemical controls on sediment metal distributions for three lakes and groups of lakes adjacent to sub-economic porphyry Mo prospects in the Endako region of central British Columbia. Tatin Lake, Hanson Lake and the Counts Lakes are within Middle Jurassic felsic intrusive rocks of the Francois Lake plutonic suite. The objectives are to determine: (i) the extent to which lake sediment geochemistry reflects the presence of adjacent porphyry Mo prospects; (ii) distribution patterns of Mo and other elements in lake sediments, and (iii) the effectiveness of lake sediments as a regional Mo exploration medium. Bottom waters of Tatin Lake are anoxic below 15-17 m depth and a range of limnological regimes, from eutrophic to oligotrophic, are present in three sub-basins. Mo-Cu mineralization occurs northwest of the lake. Hanson Lake is thermally unstratified, with sub-oxic to anoxic conditions occurring locally below 4-5 m depth. A Mo-Cu showing is present about 2.5 km south of the lake, and there is an extensive area of elevated Zn-Pb-Cu in soils to the north. The Counts lakes are a group of small, mostly eutrophic, lakes and ponds downslope of known Mo mineralization. Sediments at Tatin, Hanson and the Counts Lakes contain elevated median Mo concentrations of 8 ppm (max: 23 ppm), 7 ppm (max: 55 ppm) and 42 ppm (max: 165 ppm), respectively, relative to regional background of 1-2 pm. Mo distribution patterns are influenced by proximity to mineralization, basin morphology, limnological variations and the high organic matter content of centre-basin sediments. The distribution of Mo in lake sediments reflect the locations of adjacent quartz-molybdenite veins and their dispersed remnants in soil and till. Anomaly patterns are interpreted to be of hydromorphic origin, with Mo transported to lake basins in sub-surface ground water and, to a lesser extent, surface waters prior to complexing by organic-rich sediments. Most of the highest Mo concentrations in Tatin Lake are in the west end of the lake (up to 14 ppm), in near-shore shallow-water organic sediments near Mo-Cu mineralization and in profundal sediments of the westernmost sub-basin. There is a close association between the distribution of Mo and Lot. Elevated Mo concentrations (11-18 ppm) are closely associated with centre-lake profundal sediments in Hanson Lake. Sediment geochemical patterns in the Counts Lakes are strongly influenced by proximity to Mo mineralization, with the highest Mo concentrations (max: 165 ppm) in the westernmost ponds downslope of known prospects. Centre-basin results from Tatin Lake (12, 7-10, 23 ppm), Hanson Lake (11-12 ppm) and the Counts lakes (49, 160, 60, 33, 38, 56, 54, 83 ppm) exceed regional background by 3-80x. Elevated centre-basin Mo concentrations of at least 12 ppm reflect the presence of adjacent porphyry Mo mineralization. Centre-lake sediments do not however always have the highest Mo concentrations, due to variations in Mo content between sub-basins of the same lake and to the presence of near-shore Mo zoning patterns downslope and down drainage of mineralization. Centre-lake sampling of every lake and sub-basin is recommended for regional geochemical surveys. For follow-up surveys, near-shore sediments should also be sampled, particularly at base of slope and adjacent to drainage inflows, to delineate any lateral zoning patterns which may infer a general direction toward buried mineral deposits.

AB  - The distribution and status of the Mountain Beaver, Aplodontia rufa, in Canada is reviewed, based on museum specimens, published and unpublished sources, other collected observations, and on sign surveys conducted from 1996 to 1998 east of the Cascade Mountain divide. Biological information presented from the sign surveys includes densities of nest sites, habitat parameters, the diet based on plants found in haypiles outside nest sites, and the effects of clearcutting on Mountain Beaver. In Canada, Mountain Beavers are limited to extreme southwestern British Columbia because the Fraser River is an effective barrier to northward dispersal along the Coast Mountains, and because climates become too dry to support Mountain Beavers east and north of the Cascade Mountains. Typical habitat on the east side of the Cascade Mountains consists of sites with damp soils, often near streams, at elevations between 1200 and 1800 m. Principal summer food species found in haypiles within forests were Sitka Valerian (Valeriana sitchensis), Horsetail (Equisetum spp.), Twisted Stalk (Streptopus spp.), Thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), and Cow-parsnip (Heracleum lanatum). Narrow-leaved Fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) was the most common food in haypiles in clearcuts. Densities of underground nest sites in small (< 2.5 ha) areas of high quality habitat reached up to 5.8 nests/ha. Densities over large areas where high habitat quality was relatively widespread averaged 35.3 nests/km(2). Where high quality habitat was not as widespread, densities averaged only 5.9 nests/km(2). Very low densities of 2 nests/km(2) were found where the heavy machinery associated with clearcutting and the site preparations for planting had severely disturbed the soil layer while 42 nests/km(2) were found where logging had been conducted in similar areas but without soil disturbance. The status of the Mountain Beaver in Canada is considered vulnerable because the range appears to be contracting in the lower Fraser River valley due to habitat lost to urbanization and agriculture, and because of its susceptibility to intensive forestry operations elsewhere in its range in Canada.

AB  - Tree kill and salvage logging are profoundly changing the hydrology of mountain pine beetle-infested, snowmelt-dominated catchments. Baker Creek, located in the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada, is in the heart of the infested region. This study relates observed and modelled changes in hydrology to geomorphic controls to predict the potential for channel change. Modelling using the Distributed-Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation-Model indicates that discharge is highly sensitive to tree kill and salvage logging, with increases of 65-100% possible. It was found that low-gradient reaches typical of the interior plateau are likely to be relatively insensitive to channel change, but will become significant sediment stores as sediment is mobilized elsewhere in the catchment. Higher gradient reaches, which typically occur where interior rivers incise to meet the Fraser River, are more susceptible to change. A geomorphic threshold classification was able to identify change channel thresholds. Salvage harvesting scenarios exceeding 40% cause some reaches to cross stability thresholds, with the potential for significant changes in channel morphology.

AB  - Management of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban settings is of growing concern because they often recolonize areas from which they had been extirpated. Urban landscapes offer much needed bear habitat, buffer habitat losses in other areas, and offer protection for bear populations, but only if conflicts between bears and humans are managed. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, a survey of a sample of Prince George residents was conducted to determine their attitudes toward black bears and bear management, including euthanasia (N = 71). These residents tended to feel positively toward black bears, but were split on the issue of euthanasia, with half being firmly opposed and half recognizing the need under certain conditions. There was a significant preference for non-lethal management tools, suggesting an opportunity for governments to explore options for managing human activities that created bear attractants.

AB  - "Core areas" of transmission for bacterial sexually transmitted infections have been identified. However, it is unclear whether core areas apply to viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). We used geographic mapping and spatial analysis to identify distinct core areas of HCV infection in British Columbia (BC) using the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC-HTC), 1990-2013. The BC-HTC includes all BC residents tested for HCV (similar to 1.5 million; 1990-2013). Core HCV infection areas were identified spatially and temporally for five time periods (1990-1993, 1994-1998, 1999-2003, 2004-2008 and 2009-2013) through thematic mapping, Kernel Density Estimation, Hotspot analysis and cluster analysis at the Census dissemination area level in ArcGIS and SatScan. HCV infection core areas were consistently identified. HCV core areas expanded from the downtown of major cities in different regions of BC (Metro Vancouver, Vancouver Island, and Northern BC; 1990-1998), to smaller cities in Metro Vancouver and Interior BC (2000 onwards). Statistically significant clusters, or hotspots, were also observed for downtown Vancouver, Northern BC (Prince George) and Vancouver Island from 1990 to 2008 with expansion to other urban areas in Metro Vancouver from 1990-2013. Statistically significant clusters persisted after adjustment for injection drug use, number of HCV tests, age, sex, material and social deprivation. Persistence of areas with high HCV diagnoses rates in Vancouver and Prince George supports the theory of core areas of HCV transmission. Identification of core areas can inform prevention, care and treatment programme interventions and evaluate their impact over time.

AB  - Recent studies have reported the occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPS) in commercial feeds used by fish hatcheries and aquaculture facilities. We measured levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzo furans (PCDFs), as well as several organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in several aquafeeds as well as fry and smolts collected from four federal salmonid hatcheries from coastal British Columbia. Sigma PCBs in aquafeed samples (n=22) averaged 270 +/- 136 ng/g lipid. Sigma EDDTs, Sigma Toxaphene, Sigma Chlordanes. Sigma Chlorobenzenes, Sigma Hexachlorocyclohexanes, dieldrin, endrin and pentachloroanisole in feeds ranged between 0.6 and 200 ng/g lipid. Sigma EPCDD/F levels in feed samples were relatively low (77 +/- 50 pg/g lipid). In some cases, contaminant levels and patterns varied between different feed brands (i.e., Moore-Clarke, EWOS and OMP). Sigma PCB concentrations (ng/g lipid) in Moore-Clarke (154.3 +/- 88.9) were significantly lower (p<0.05) than Sigma PCBs in OMP (319.8 +/- 101) and EWOS (376.3 +/- 88.2) feeds. which is likely due to different constituent composition in the Moore-Clarke feed. As young hatchery salmon smolts are sequentially introduced to increasingly lipid-rich starter feeds (which contain higher contaminant burdens), dietary exposure of POPS generally increases during the rearing process. However, tissue residue concentrations of POPS in smolts remained relatively low compared to feed, as denoted by the relatively low biomagnification factors of the various POPS (BMFs between 0.2 and 3). 2,3.7,8 TCCD toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQs) in smolts (0.21 +/- 0.19 pg/g wet wt.) were generally below levels associated with dioxin-like toxic effects. The highest TEQ was observed in Robertson Creek smolts (0.38 +/- 0.11 pg/g wet wt). Biochemical response measurements (EROD activity and CYPIA levels) in liver tissue of those smolts did not show any indication of negative impacts associated with aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor inducers such as dioxins/furans and dioxin-like PCBs.

AB  - Environmental modelling of remote areas requires dynamical downscaling of meteorological data to obtain precipitation values that could substitute for sparse in-situ observations. This study examined numerical simulations of precipitation over the Terrace-Kitimat Valley, an industrializing corridor in the Coast Mountains of northern British Columbia, Canada. Modelling uncertainty was explored for 1 year of output from the Weather Research and Forecasting model at 1-km grid spacing for three atmospheric forcing datasets and two planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes. The observed total precipitation ranged from 1170 to 2380 mm and was often underestimated by more than 40% when using the North American Regional Reanalysis as atmospheric forcing data or the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino level 3 (MYNN3) parameterization as PBL scheme. Persistent low bias from model configurations using these configurations suggested that merely selecting an alternative atmospheric forcing dataset does not ameliorate systematic error occasioned by a poorly performing PBL parameterization. Hence, the choice of the PBL scheme and the meteorological dataset is important for spatial estimation of precipitation using WRF. Model output best corresponded with annual gauge measurements when simulations with the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL scheme were forced with ERA5. The North American Mesoscale Analyses (NAM-ANL) however demonstrated better performance for monthly variation and high-intensity precipitation than ERA5. Using both datasets therefore may be valuable for calculations related to environmental change. With either NAM-ANL or ERA5 as atmospheric forcing data and MYJ as the PBL scheme, the uncertainty in annual simulated precipitation amount ranged between 38% overestimation and 21% underestimation of observational data.

AB  - The early Eocene is an important time in Cenozoic history because it marked the height of global warming, coincident with significant reorganization of the mammalian biota. In North America, our understanding of mammalian diversity during this interval is largely limited to a fossil record south of the 49th Parallel. New discoveries in the early Eocene Driftwood Creek beds (Ootsa Lake Group), northern British Columbia (similar to 55 degrees N) double the known diversity of Eocene mammals from this Canadian province and provide a window into the mammalian community that lived near the northernmost lake of the Okanagan Highlands, a series of Eocene lake deposits extending north-south from Republic, Washington, to Smithers, northern British Columbia. A diverse insect and fish fauna has been described from Okanagan Highlands Eocene lake shales, together with a diverse flora, interpreted as a cool upland forested landscape. We report the tapiroid cf. Heptodon and an erinaceomorph lipotyphlan Silvacola acares, gen. et sp. nov., from the Driftwood Creek beds. Presence of cf. Heptodon is consistent with the late early Eocene age of the Driftwood Creek beds determined by radiometric dating and palynology. Heptodon is otherwise known from Eocene localities in Wyoming and Colorado as well as Ellesmere Island in the High Arctic, whereas erinaceids are recorded from late Paleocene sites in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the U. S. Western Interior and are relatively uncommon at Eocene sites in the U. S. Western Interior. Occurrence of cf. Heptodon at Driftwood Canyon supports the hypothesis proposed by others that tapiroids are proxies of densely forested habitats.

AB  - Comprehensive solid waste management programs are one of the greatest challenges to achieving campus sustainability. Conducting a waste characterization study is a critical first step in successful waste management planning and advancing the overall sustainability of an institution of higher education. This paper reports on a waste characterization study that was conducted at the Prince George campus of the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). The aim of the study was to determine the amount and composition of waste generated within key campus operational areas and to provide recommendations to senior university administration on strategies for waste minimization, higher rates of recycling and composting and improving the overall sustainability of the campus waste management program. It was determined that during the 2007-2008 academic year the Prince George campus produced between 1.2 and 2.2 metric tonnes of waste per week, of which more than 70% could have been diverted through waste reduction, recycling and composting activities. Paper and paper products, disposable drink containers and compostable organic material represented three of the most significant material types for targeted waste reduction and recycling efforts. Various educational and policy techniques, which may be used to promote campus community waste minimization behaviours in the long term, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - [1] Samples for geochronologic, geobarometric, and paleomagnetic analyses were collected across the northern portion of the Ecstall pluton southeast of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Al-inhornblende geobarometry indicates pressures from 740 +/- 10 to 840 +/- 30 MPa corresponding to crystallization depths of similar to25 to similar to30 km. U/Pb analyses of zircons from western, central, and eastern localities within the pluton yield crystallization ages of 91.5 +/- 1.0 Ma, 90.8 +/- 1.0 Ma, and 90.5 +/- 1.0 Ma, respectively. Rock magnetic experiments, reflected light microscopy, and thermal demagnetization behavior suggest that natural remanent magnetism is carried by low-Ti titanohematite. Unblocking temperatures of the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) are dominantly in the 560 degreesC to 630 degreesC range, with age of magnetization approximated by the 40Ar/39Ar hornblende ages of 84.2 +/- 0.10 Ma on the western margin and 76.4 +/- 0.6 Ma in the center of the pluton. Site-mean ChRM directions were isolated for paleomagnetic samples from 23 sites and are distributed along a small circle with subhorizontal axis at similar to340degrees azimuth. ChRM directions from the central portion of the pluton are concordant with the expected Cretaceous magnetic field direction, while ChRM directions from the western margin are discordant by >70degrees. Folding of the Ecstall pluton, either during Late Cretaceous west directed thrust transport above the convex upward Prince Rupert Shear Zone or during younger deformation of the pluton and underlying shear zone, can account for the paleomagnetic data and is consistent with the geochronologic, geobarometric, and structural geologic observations.

AB  - Reconstruction of the geomorphic history of the Moose Lake delta is used to infer environmental change in the uppermost Fraser River watershed, British Columbia. Delta-top changes are interpreted from surface channel morphology, riverbank exposures, hand auger data, vibracores and other borehole records. River channel and overbank sediments are related to source area contributions in terms of granule lithology and fine (<63 mum) fraction geochemistry. A substantial area of the northeast delta-top floodplain dates from the early Holocene, and is characterized by fragmentary, low-discharge paleochannels with bed material characteristic of the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Floodplain development since ca. 4.0 ka BP has been limited to the western and southern areas of the delta and records persistently higher sediment loads, aggradation and larger, more active channels. These changes reflect overall shifts from warm, dry Hypsithermal to cooler, wetter Neoglacial climatic conditions defined regionally. The composition of both laterally and vertically accreted floodplain sediments plus channel morphology and floodplain stratigraphy record the changing influence of partially glaciated source areas on the Holocene sediment flux. Specifically, periods of climatic deterioration and possibly glacier expansion lead to relatively greater yields of carbonate-rich sediment from the higher elevation Moose River sub-basin. Storage and reworking of sediments on the Moose Lake delta-top floodplain influence interpretation of the more distal lacustrine record. Over the last 4000 years, gradual increases in lacustrine sedimentation rate of up to similar to 18% are inferred to result from delta progradation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS), which grew and melted repeatedly across the mountain ranges of westernmost Canada during the late Cenozoic, has imprinted its legacy in the form of glacial landforms, such as meltwater landforms. However, despite their abundance, a coherent effort to map meltwater landforms has been lacking. Here, we present a first regional geomorphological map of glacial meltwater landforms of central British Columbia. Series of well-developed meltwater channels occur at higher elevations on the Interior Plateau, in marginal ranges east of the Coast Mountains, in the Skeena and Omineca mountains, and, in much lower abundances, in the Rocky Mountains. Single-ridged eskers, that in direction are consistent with the regional ice flow direction from glacial lineations, occur in elevated areas of the Interior Plateau. Multiple-ridged larger eskers and esker complexes are, on the other hand, confined to the main topographic lows. The geographical distribution of meltwater landforms is a new reliable dataset for use in palaeoglaciological reconstructions and inference of late glacial ice sheet dynamics in central British Columbia.

AB  - Northwest-striking brittle faults containing cataclasite, fault gouge, and, in one location, pseudotachylyte are common in the vicinity of the Coast shear zone near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. The pseudotachylyte locality, found in a dextral strike-slip fault zone along the Coast shear zone, contains spherulites, alkali feldspar microlites, and amygdules, suggesting that the pseudotachylyte crystallized rapidly from a melt phase within 5 km of the surface. 40Ar/39Ar incremental heating of the pseudotachylyte matrix yielded a weighted mean plateau of 29.8 +/- 0.6 Ma and an inverse isochron of 29.8 +/- 1.5 Ma with an 40Ar/Ar-36 intercept of 296.0 +/- 15.2. These results show that pseudotachylyte associated with brittle faulting can be dated precisely, and imply that some dextral coast-parallel displacement occurred across the Coast shear zone in the Oligocene and that the majority of exhumation in the Coast Mountains at the latitude of Prince Rupert (similar to54degreesN) was accomplished by 30 Ma.

AB  - Transport infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts as it is designed for long operational lives, and both episodic and seasonal conditions contribute to deterioration, disruption and unsafe incidents. There are some examples of adaptation in transportation design, but many communities do not have the capacity to incorporate climate change considerations into infrastructure planning and management. Researchers worked closely with the City of Prince George, in Central British Columbia, Canada, to build on existing work and explore how the City could plan, design, and maintain roads and other structures to account for climate change. A local steering committee was formed, and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics. Two focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during a workshop with practitioners, researchers, consultants and other representatives. The workshop precipitated an investigation of projected impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety, and plans to explore alternative paving techniques. Outcomes of the case study provide insights regarding climate change and local transportation infrastructure, including: how researchers can engage with local experts to explore adaptation; issues local governments perceive as important; and barriers communities face as they attempt to address vulnerabilities.

AB  - The aims of this investigation were (1) to measure the impact of arts-related activities on the perceived quality of life of a representative sample of British Columbians aged 18 years or more in the spring of 2007, and (2) to compare the findings of this study with those of a sample of 1,027 adults drawn from five B.C. communities (Comox Valley, Kamloops, Nanaimo, Port Moody and Prince George) in the fall of 2006. Seven hundred and eight British Columbians responded to a mailed out questionnaire, and the working data set was weighted by age and education to match the 2006 census statistics for the province, yielding a fairly representative sample. Speaking quite generally, about 62.0% of the results for the two samples are very similar. In particular, in both surveys we found that (a) among arts-related activities in which people participate relatively infrequently (i.e., participation is counted in times per year rather than in hours per week), live theatre is supreme in the strength of its positive correlation with respondents' perceived quality of life measured in 7 different ways, and (b) compared to 4 demographic variables (age, education, household income and body mass index), household income had the highest average, positive correlation with 7 different measures of respondents' overall life assessments, namely, self-assessed general health, satisfaction with life as a whole (single item), happiness, satisfaction with the quality of life, satisfaction with life as a whole (5-item index), contentment with life (5-item index) and subjective wellbeing (4-item index). Different results were found in the province-wide versus the five-communities survey for the following, among other things, (a) compared to all 7 life assessment measures, for the province, satisfaction with the quality of life and happiness had the largest number of significant correlations with arts-related activities measured in hours per week engaged, while for the five communities, the single measure of satisfaction with the quality of life had the largest number of significant correlations, and (b) For the province, compared to all 7 life assessment measures, satisfaction with the quality of life had the largest number of significant correlations with arts-related activities measured in times per year engaged; for the five communities, compared to all 7 life assessment measures, self-assessed general health had the largest number of significant correlations with arts-related activities measured in times per year engaged.

AB  - Akin to most areas in North America and Western Europe in the aftermath of the Second World War, Northern British Columbia experienced a moral panic over a perceived rise in teen trouble and juvenile delinquency. Framed in part by language centred on the nefarious influences of American crime comics, rock and roll music, ducktail haircuts, and zoot suits, the crisis can be explained by emerging generational identities, Cold War angst, and media portrayals of a society allegedly on the verge of collapse. For parents and community leaders in Prince George, British Columbia, however, the long-standing unease over the community's reputation as a disorderly lumber town provided a crucial backdrop for these broader factors. As the community increasingly aspired to the trappings of postwar, middle-class respectability, the concern over teen trouble provided an arena to wrestle over community identity and the ways local residents wished to be seen by the outside world.

AB  - In British Columbia, Canada, resource development takes place within the traditional territories of Aboriginal people, often without signed treaties or agreements. This frequently sparks opposition from local Indigenous communities, even in locations where economic benefits are promised in exchange for access to land. This paper casts light on this subject through a case study of resistance among the Tsilhqot'in Indigenous people, who are protesting against the development of a multi-million dollar gold-copper mine within their traditional territory. Drawing on findings from Community-Based research and a review of documents from Tsilhqot'in court cases, this paper provides a deepened understanding about the relationship the Tsilhqot'in people have with their land. The major themes covered are as follows: (1) Aboriginal community values, which are critical to the survival of such people; and (2) the contemporary culture of the Tsilhqot'in people, including profiling how some women continue to survive on the land. The study captures the dynamics of Aboriginal values at the project location and how these are affected by resource development activities. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

This paper aims at developing an integrated model simulating physical processes that govern the quantity and quality of inflow, reservoir, and outflow water of the Nechako Reservoir. Such a model would help stakeholders understand the response of in-reservoir water temperature stratification and downstream water temperature to changes in inflow and reservoir operation under future climate change.New hydrological insights for the region: The model was calibrated against historical reservoir levels and in-reservoir and outlet water temperature field data. The integrated model simulated accu-rately the wide variation of reservoir levels as well as the in-reservoir water temperature at Kenney Dam and the outlet temperature. Sensitivity analysis shows that reservoir water tem-perature particularly the epilimnion is sensitive to changes in both meteorological and hydro-logical forcing. Forcing the model with different outflow scenarios shows the weak sensitivity of temperature of water released to outflow rates. Given epilimnion water releases at the spillway, the Summer Temperature Management Program could be inefficient to provide cool water in the Nechako River during the critical period of salmon migration in a warming climate. However, colder water remains available at depth at Kenney Dam to potentially mitigate and better control downstream water temperature.

AB  - Province-wide aerial overview surveys have been conducted in British Columbia by the Ministry of Forests since 1999 and earlier by the Forest Insect and Disease Survey, Canadian Forest Service. The results of the 2003 overview survey shows that the size of the mountain pine beetle infestation has doubled since 2002 increasing from 1.98 million ha to approximately 4.1 million ha and is now the largest infestation of mountain pine beetle ever documented. The greatest changes have occurred in the central interior plateau where the area infested increased by 4.3 times in the former Cariboo Forest Re on. The outbreak is expected to continue unabated until the host is depleted or a lethal cold-winter event occurs.

AB  - This study assesses Little Ice Age (LIA) lake sediment morphological and geochemical records and moraine chronologies in the upper Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, Canada, to resolve differences in paleoenvironmental interpretation and to clarify sediment production and sediment delivery processes within alpine geomorphic systems Moose Lake (13 9 km(2)), situated at 1032 ma sl, contains a partially varved record indicating variable rates of accumulation during the last millennium that, in general, coincide with previously documented LIA glacial advances in the region and locally Dendrochronological assessment of forefield surfaces in the headwaters of the catchment (Reef Icefield) shows that periods of moraine construction occurred just prior to AD 1770, AD 1839 and AD 1883, and some time before AD 1570 Taken collectively, increases in varve thickness within eight Moose Lake sediment cores coincide with documented glacier advances over the twelfth through fourteenth centuries, the eighteenth century, and nineteenth through twentieth centuries Glacial activity during the sixteenth century is also indicated While varve thickness variations in proximal and distal sediments clearly reflect glacial activity upstream of Moose Lake, the intermediate varve record is relatively insensitive to these decadel and longer-term catchment processes. Variations in Ca and related elements derived from glaciated carbonate terrain within the Moose River sub-catchment (including Reef Icefield) indicate gradually increasing delivery from these sources from the twelfth through twentieth centuries even where the varve thickness record is unresponsive Elevated carbonate concentrations confirm glacial activity C.

AB  - Outbreaks of forest defoliating insects are usually synchronized over a large spatial scale. Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region.

AB  - New mapping, mineralogical, and geochemical studies help characterize late Tertiary primitive, alkaline, sodic basanite, alkali olivine basalt, transitional basalt, and diabase in the Nechako River, Whitesail Lake, and McLeod Lake map areas of central British Columbia and distinguish the Miocene Cheslatta Lake suite. The suite encompasses scattered erosional remnants of topographically distinct, columnar-jointed, olivine-phyric basalt and diabase volcanic necks, dykes, and associated lava flows north of the Anahim volcanic belt and west of the Pinchi Fault. Volcanic centres at Alasla Mountain and at Cutoff Creek, near Cheslatta Lake, are proposed as type areas. Olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene phenocrysts, megacrysts, and (or) xenocrysts; common ultramafic xenoliths; and rare but significant plutonic and metamorphic xenoliths are characteristic. Basanite, transitional basalt, and alkali olivine basalt groundmass contain plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, feldspathoid, olivine, and apatite. The Cheslatta Lake suite is characterized by its alkaline character, olivine-rich (> 10 wt.%) normative mineralogy, and silica-undersaturated nature (>1 wt.% normative nepheline; hypersthene-normative rocks are uncommon). Mg numbers vary between 72-42. Some samples encompass near-primitive mantle melt compositions. Cheslatta Lake suite rocks in the Nechako River area are distinguished from the underlying Eocene Endako and stratigraphically higher Neogene Chilcotin groups basaltic andesite lavas within the study area, and from the Chilcotin Group basalt in the type area south of the Anahim volcanic belt, by form, preserved thickness, phenocryst-xenocryst mineralogy, amygdule abundance, included xenoliths, isotopic age, and major and incompatible, high field strength, and rare-earth trace element contents.

AB  - The Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada, is the longest non-dammed river on the west coast of North America and supplies 20 x 10(6) t/yr of sediment to the Pacific Ocean. Abundant geomorphological evidence indicates that the Fraser River reversed its course to southward flow in the recent geological past. Investigation of two volcanic dams at Dog Creek demonstrates northward flow of the Fraser until at least 1.06 Ma, before reversal and erosion of the 270-km-long Fraser Canyon. We propose that the submarine Nitinat Fan off the coast of British Columbia records the reversal and sudden input of coarse continental-derived sediment ca. 0.76 Ma. This study confirms reversal of the Fraser River and places a firm constraint on the maximum age of that reversal. Reversal likely followed stream capture in response to enhanced glaciofluvial erosion and uplift of the Coast Mountains.

AB  - The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) precipitation product was evaluated using station observations and catchment water yield in British Columbia (BC), Canada, at inter-annual, monthly, and daily time scales. A structural break occurred in 2003, associated with exclusion of Canadian precipitation gauge data from NARR's data assimilation process beginning in that year. The NARR product under-predicted precipitation in mountainous regions, over-predicted in the northern region of BC's Interior Plateau, and catchment-averaged NARR precipitation was less than observed water yield in coastal BC. The product was unable to reproduce even the seasonal pattern at three stations. This study highlights uncertainties associated with the NARR precipitation product, and presents a cautionary tale that is likely relevant not only to the application of NARR in BC, but may be relevant for other re-analysis products and other regions with complex topography and sparse station networks.

AB  - Safe development of glacierized regions requires a systematic and objective method for assessing the hazard posed by moraine-dammed lakes. Empirical relations exist for estimating outburst flood magnitude, but, until now, no standardized procedures have been developed for estimating outburst flood probability. To make quick and inexpensive preliminary assessments that are reproducible, we propose using a statistical, remote sensing-based approach to estimate the probability of catastrophic drainage of moraine-dammed lakes. We completed a comprehensive inventory of 175 moraine-dammed lakes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. By applying logistic regression analysis to the data set, we identified and weighted the following four independent predictor variables that best discriminate drained lakes from undrained lakes: moraine height-to-width ratio, presence/absence of an ice-core in the moraine, lake area, and main rock type forming the moraine. With an appropriate classification cutoff value, the predictive model correctly classifies 70% of drained lakes and 90% of undrained lakes, for an overall accuracy of 88%. Our model provides engineers and geoscientists with a tool for making first-order estimates of the probability of catastrophic drainage from moraine-dammed lakes in southwestern British Columbia.

AB  - The growth of mountain hemlock trees in Pacific North America demonstrates a complex relationship to two or more seasonal environmental variables. In order to examine the radial growth response of mountain hemlock to subseasonal climate variables, ring-width and X-ray densitometric analyses were used to construct intra-annual dendroclimatic records. The intent was to highlight the difference between the dendroclimatic outcomes of standard ring-width analyses to those derived from density chronologies collected at high elevation locations in the British Columbia Coast Mountains. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tree-ring parameters to better define the complex growth behaviour in mountain hemlock trees for the construction of more robust proxy climate records. Tree-ring chronologies from three sites were used to describe the inherent climate-growth trends. Maximum tree-ring density values provided a robust data series for constructing site-specific proxy records of late-summer temperature. Annual ring-width measurements provided independent proxies of spring snowpack trends. Significant decreases in temperature and an increase in snowpack depth during the early 1700s and early 1800s coincides with documented PDO phases and Little Ice Age glacier advances. Identification of early and late growing season climate signals within mountain hemlock trees demonstrates the value of documenting the characteristics of multiple tree ring parameters in future dendroclimatic studies.

AB  - Twenty-three new, precise, Eocene U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar age determinations for calc-alkaline volcanic rocks of the Ootsa Lake Group and associated intrusive rocks, widespread in the Nechako Plateau in central British Columbia, constrain the timing of the Eocene magmatism to 53.2-47.6 Ma, with a local duration of as little as 2-3 million years. The new dates show that magmatism in the study area is partly coeval with that responsible for the Babine Igneous Suite - Newman Volcanic Suite (53-50 Ma) to the north, and for the Endako Group (51-45 Ma), which overlies the Ootsa Lake Group; however, locally the three magmatic suites are distinct in age and (or) the strata record a magmatic hiatus of as much as 7.5 million years. The ages generally young from north to south (52-47 Ma) along the western portion of the study area. The Babine Igneous Suite - Newman Volcanic Suite represents the oldest member of this series. However, in the east, the Ootsa Lake Group volcanic rocks are generally older (53-51 Ma). The anomalously older ages may be related to the interaction of magmatism and formation of a nearby and coeval core complex, which ongoing studies show was uplifted at about the same time during the Eocene. Felsic plutonism associated with the Ootsa Lake Group occurred between 50.5 and 47.3 Ma. These plutons were emplaced in an extensional setting along north-northeast-trending faults. The new dates, stratigraphic relationships, and suggested correlations of Eocene strata in the study area with that to the west and north require a revision of the stratigraphic nomenclature for the Ootsa Lake and Endako groups.

AB  - Regional-scale estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) are challenging in alpine regions, particularly in areas of high accumulation and dense forest cover, suggesting efforts to improve these estimates may benefit from an evaluation of existing gridded products. Gridded SWE products comprising four reanalysis datasets (ERA-Interim, ERA-Interim/Land, MERRA and MERRA-Land), two land data assimilation system datasets (GLDAS1 and GLDAS2) and two observation-based products (CMC and GlobSnow) have been compared with in-situ measurements over five physiographic regions in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Time series were generated for each survey month (January through June), and median correlation, bias and mean absolute error (MAE) values were found for each product and physiographic region. The best performance in correlation and magnitude of bias and MAE was seen in areas of lowest SWE accumulation and land relief (e.g. the Interior Plains of northern BC), while poorer performance was seen in regions of high accumulation and complex topography (Columbia and Rocky Mountains and Coast Mountains). Overall, the performance ranking order is ERA-Interim/Land (best), GLDAS2, MERRA, CMC, GLDAS1, MERRA-Land, GlobSnow and ERA-Interim. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Karst is a three-dimensional landscape that occurs in soluble bedrock (typically limestone, marble, dolostone, gypsum or halite) and is defined by a solutionally weathered surface, a subsurface drainage system (where conduit-flow dominates), and underground openings and caves. Karst can host unique flora and subsurface fauna, as well as a wide range of other scientific, recreational and cultural values. Karst and potential karst areas underlie approximately 10% of British Columbia (BC), but the distribution and extent of this landscape has yet to be fully explored and delineated. Some of the most extensive and well-developed karst areas occur within the forested limestone areas of coastal BC, such as on Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii, where numerous surface karst features and caves are known. Karst in the interior plateau regions of British Columbia is less well known, being in part covered by thick deposits of glacial materials. Alpine karst regions are most apparent in the Rocky Mountains where there are limestone plateaus, karst drainages and cave systems that have close connections to past and present glacial systems. Mapping of karst is a critical component for any land-use or resource development activity in all regions of British Columbia, as the environmental impacts on karst and its associated values are potentially significant. The regional distribution of karst in BC is not well mapped, with only an office-based reconnaissance karst potential map (1:250,000-scale) and a related database completed in 1999. A renewed effort should now be made to better map karst across British Columbia using digital bedrock mapping data released in 2017, combined with more recent satellite imagery and improved field knowledge.

AB  - Paleomagnetic data of plutons from the western Canadian Cordillera are currently interpreted to indicate thousands of kilometers of latitudinal transport, in situ tilting, or post-intrusion folding. For the Ecstall pluton of British Columbia, the inclination of magnetic remanence directions steepens to the east from 16degrees to 81degrees [Butler et al., J. Geophys. Res. 107 (2002)] between 24 and 12 kin west of a thermal boundary with the Coast Mountains batholith (CMB). The CMB was at 700-800degreesC between 60 and 52 Ma. The. stable remanent magnetization is in ilmenohematite grains with exsolved lamellae of ferrian ilmenite. It has the characteristic properties of lamellar magnetism [Robinson et al., Nature 418 (2002) 517-520] which is acquired with exsolution in ilmenohematite below 390degreesC [Ghiorso, Phys. Chem. Minerals 25 (1997) 28-38]; thus, it is thermal chemical remanent magnetization (TCRM). Our heat flow calculations show that the thermal effects of Eocene CMB on the adjacent 91 Ma Ecstall pluton were enough to reset the remanent magnetization directions. Reheating to the temperatures necessary for TCRM is supported by K/Ar and Ar/Ar cooling dates on hornblende and biotite, which young from west to east towards the CMB in concert with the change in inclinations. Thus, the progressive steepening of magnetization inclinations is attributed to reheating during the Eocene of the 91 Ma Ecstall pluton by the CMB. This reheating followed post-solidification northward latitudinal displacement of the pluton. The amount of translational displacement of the coastal terranes of British Columbia prior to 60 Ma hinges on the interpretation of discordant magnetizations from plutons that may have cooled slowly after emplacement in the mid to lower crust, as was the case for the Ecstall pluton. Many of these plutons contain ilmenohematite as an accessory magnetic phase. Our interpretation for the low temperature acquisition of TCRM in the Ecstall pluton may have far-reaching implications for understanding enigmatic discordant paleomagnetic directions reported from plutons of the western Canadian Cordillera.

AB  - Key message Analyses of tree-ring wood properties combined with an understanding of tree physiology provided detailed intra-annual insights into historical and seasonal climate phenomena in sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed.

AB  - Extreme snow avalanche runout is typically estimated using a combination of historical and vegetation records as well as statistical and dynamic models. The two classes of statistical models (alpha beta and runout ratio) are based on estimating runout distance past the beta-point, which is typically defined as the point where the avalanche slope incline first decreases to 10. The parameters for these models vary from mountain range to mountain range. In Canada, alpha-beta and runout ratio parameters have been published for the combined Rocky and Purcell Mountains and for the British Columbia Coast Mountains. Despite active development, no suitable tall avalanche path model parameters have been published for the Columbia Mountains or for the Lizard Range area around Fernie, B.C. Using a dataset of 65 avalanche paths, statistical model parameters have been derived for these regions.

AB  - The Sea to Sky corridor stretches over a distance of 135 km into British Columbia's Coast Mountains. The corridor has witnessed hundreds of historical and pre-historic landslides. In the last 154 years, 155 landslide events have been reported. The most common types of landslides are rockfalls and debris flows, which are small in volume, but can be quite damaging. These are more abundant in the southern part of the corridor where infrastructure is built close to steep slopes. Two different methods were adapted to create debris flow and rockfall/rock slide susceptibility maps. Both qualitative heuristic and fuzzy logic susceptibility maps showed a similar distribution of susceptibility zones, especially high susceptibility. Correlation of high susceptibility zones with occurrence of historical and mapped geological landslide events was very good. Success rate curves were calculated for extrapolated zones of initiation for debris flow and rockfall/rock slide deposits. Success rate curves were better for debris flow than rockfall/rockslide maps.

AB  - Sixty-four moss and organic litter samples were collected from five biogeoclimatic zones distributed from sea level on the central coast of British Columbia onto the western edge of the Interior Plateau at 1000-1900 m and analyzed for pollen and spores. Four of the five biogeoclimatic zones produced characteristic pollen and spore spectra. The coastal western hemlock biogeoclimatic zone is characterized by Tsuga heterophylla, Alnus, and Cupressaceae. Significant levels of nonarboreal pollen (NAP), mainly Lysichiton and fern spores, occur in some sites. Interior Douglas-fir zone samples are dominated by Pseudotsuga and Tsuga heterophylla with notable Betula, Cupressaceae, and Alnus. Pinus pollen becomes the dominant type at the eastern margins of the interior Douglas-fir zone and dominates the Engelmann spruce - subalpine fir, montane spruce, and subboreal pine - spruce biogeoclimatic zones at high and intermediate elevations to the east. In the Engelmann spruce - subalpine fir zone, Abies pollen is characteristically more abundant than Picea, and notable percentages of NAP, especially Artemisia, occur. In the transition from Engelmann spruce - subalpine fir zone to montane spruce zone, Abies and Picea percentages are about equal or Picea predominates slightly, whereas in the montane spruce zone and sub-boreal pine spruce zones, Picea values exceed Abies values often four to five times. Percent pollen and spore versus percent taxon cover diagrams, despite widely spread values, reveal general relationships and background pollen rain values for major taxa valuable to the interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages. Pinus is greatly overrepresented with a regional background of 10-15%. At low to intermediate cover values, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga, and Cupressaceae are represented more or less as they occur in the vegetation, with regional backgrounds up to 5%. Picea and Abies are underrepresented, with regional background value of 0-3%.

AB  - To investigate the possible effect of elevation on the prevalence of hematozoa infection, we collected blood smears from a population of Winter Wrens (Troglogytes troglodytes) in the Coast Mountains of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. We sampled 119 Winter Wrens, including 88 at low elevation (0-500 m) and 31 at high elevation (900-1100 m) sites. In addition, five other species, including Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus; N = 12), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis; N=11), Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus; N= 8), Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius; N= 4), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius; N= 4), were sampled. No Winter Wrens were infected by blood parasites. Among the other species, Haemoproteus infection was detected in one Varied Thrush (25%) and five Swainson's Thrushes (42%). Thus, despite the occurrence of infection in sympatrically breeding species, blood parasites are apparently absent or occur at extremely low prevalence in Winter Wrens in our study area. The presence of hematozoa in European populations of Winter Wrens, combined with an abundance of vector species in our study area, suggest population-level resistance to infection. Further study is needed to determine the specific mechanisms involved in the apparent lack of infection in our study population.

AB  - We examined the seasonal food habits of wolverine Gulo gulo in subboreal and interior wet-belt montane environments in British Columbia by analyzing scats collected during the course of two concurrent wolverine studies. Understanding foraging ecology for a wide-ranging carnivore such as the wolverine is important, particularly because reproduction has been demonstrated to be closely linked to food abundance. Wolverine diet was shown to vary regionally and seasonally. Regional variation was related to differences in prey availability between study areas. Moose Alces alces, caribou Rangifer tarandus, and hoary marmots Marmota caligata were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain goats Oreamnos americanus and porcupine Erithizon dorsatum were more abundant and more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while snowshoe hare Lepus americanus and beaver Castor canadensis were more abundant and more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains. Within the winter season, diet choices by reproductive females were different than other sex and age classes. Caribou, hoary marmots and porcupines were found in significantly higher frequencies in the diet of reproductive females. Foraging observations concurred with the findings of scat analyses. Dependence of reproductive females on a species of current conservation concern (caribou) and one which could be affected by issues related to climate change (hoary marmot) may present conservation issues for wolverines in the future.

AB  - Contemporary and post-glacial rates of aeolian deposition are determined for three small catchments that straddle the alpine-subalpine ecotone in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. From process measurement over a single year, the mean annual regional (allochthonous) rate of aeolian deposition for the catchments is estimated to be approximately 11 g m(-2). The average rate of annual deposition over the post-glacial period is calculated from the soil profiles to be c. 6 g m(-2), although fallout rates are likely to have varied significantly over the Holocene epoch due to changes in climate and catchment conditions. It would appear that the vegetated ground strata in these catchments are net receivers of aeolian dust fallout. Consequently, many of the soils are cumulic in nature and protect the bedrock in these catchments from subaerial weathering. These results have implications for sediment transfers in alpine and subalpine environments in southwestern British Columbia.

AB  - Blueschists and retrogressed eclogites are located along the Pinchi Fault Zone (near 54-degrees 30'N and 124-degrees-W) in central British Columbia. The Pinchi Fault separates rocks of contrasting geological histories, and the blueschists and eclogites occur with ultramafic rocks as fault-bounded blocks. The retrogressed eclogites occur as tectonic blocks, now in glacial debris, a few metres across; blueschists occur in coherent kilometre-sized tracts. Eclogites contain garnet-omphacite-rutile-quartz, with glaucophane, lawsonite and titanite. Some of the lawsonite appears to be stable with omphacite and garnet. Tectonic blocks of eclogite from two different localities have recorded different P-T histories. In one tectonic block, P-T estimates for garnet inclusions in clinopyroxene and lawsonite (c. 565-degrees-C, > 13.1 kbar) suggest that garnet and omphacite initially equilibrated outside the stability field of lawsonite. A decrease in temperature, as recorded in garnet rims and matrix clinopyroxene, resulted in crystallization of lawsonite and other retrogressive minerals. Later crystallization of stilpnomelane (locally pseudomorphing garnet), howieite, winchite and actinolite was triggered by an ir-flux of fluid under P-T conditions outside the stability field of garnet. Lawsonite appears to have been stable, suggesting a minimum pressure of about 3 kbar. In the second tectonic block, clinopyroxene inclusions in garnet suggest temperatures near 350-degrees-C (P > 10 kbar) and garnet rims equilibrated with matrix clinopyroxene suggest temperatures near 450-degrees-C at pressures above c. 12 kbar.

AB  - The Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en peoples of northwest British Columbia occupy the upper drainage of the Skeena River and the western headwaters of the Fraser River. They live in a region of diverse topography, vegetation, and climate. Berry patch burning was the most important traditional vegetation manipulation. Black huckleberry and lowbush blueberry patches were burned to stimulate growth of new stems and production of berries, while preventing invasion by other shrub species and conifers. Maintenance of berry patches by burning was discontinued in the 1930s and 1940s because of fire suppression by the British Columbia Forest Service. Spring burning on south facing slopes, village sites, and garden sites was also practiced, and continues to the present. It occurs in aspen, pine, or grass dominated seral communities, or cottonwood floodplain forest, and is intended to control brush and encourage growth of grass.

AB  - Keywords: hockey; commodification of sport; elite players; extractive peripheries; British Columbia; marchandisation du sport; joueurs d'élite; rapports centre-périphérie; Colombie-Britannique Many aspects of the system have become elitist - including feverish scouting for possible talent; the schooling of young players in hockey academies; costly specialized training; ownership and exclusive use of hockey rinks and training facilities; early adoption by sports agents; and the pressured coaching of teams, increasingly over a 12-month season with little downtime. In bygone days, sports were played seasonally and improvement came by local coaching and playing (often by unpaid volunteers), whereas current training is more intensive with specialized schools and academies owned privately or by sports enterprises that offer dedicated equipment and facilities designed to produce elite players (Jackson [32]). Privatization and professionalization of training and playing the sport in hockey academies and HPTCs has grown rapidly - 2019 marks the first year that there will not be a Bantam AAA Western Championship because the MHA's best players have been recruited by hockey academies. Vancouver, formerly almost devoid of hockey, but now with an NHL team and numerous elite training facilities, is now branded a hockey city. [Extracted from the article]

AB  - In this study, we describe lower Pliensbachian to lower Toarcian ammonoids from 10 stratigraphic sections in the New York Canyon and Westgate areas of the Luning Embayment, Gabbs Valley, and Clan Alpine Mountain Ranges, west-central Nevada, USA. Ammonoid biostratigraphy based on 408 specimens representing 23 genera and 50 species indicates the presence of the Whiteavesi, Freboldi, Kunae, and Carlottense zones of the Pliensbachian and the Kanense Zone of the lower Toarcian. The following five new species are established (in alphabetical order): Nodicoeloceras middlegatense n. sp., Nodicoeloceras nevadaense n. sp., Prodactylioceras westgatenses n. sp., Protogrammoceras (Matteiceras) tipperi n. sp., and Reynesocoeloceras corvalani n. sp. A volcanic ash bed within the basal New York Canyon type V section yielded a 206Pb/238U Chemical Abrasion-Isotope Dilution-Thermal Ionization Mass Spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) age of 188.98 ± 0.11 Ma from the middle-upper part of the Whiteavesi Zone, which will contribute to the refinement of the early Pliensbachian timescale, an interval that is at present poorly constrained.

AB  - The main objectives of “conservation aquaculture” are the protection, restoration and multiplication of rare and endangered species or individual fish populations. Hatchery reproduction is an effective means of preserving wild populations, but can only be used in extreme cases when the population is on the verge of extinction. The US “Conservation Aquaculture” methods are considered using the example of an isolated white sturgeon population Acipenser transmontanus Kootenai river, who lost the possibility of natural replenishment. The main features of plant reproduction in the framework of “conservation aquaculture” are: 1) preservation of genetic diversity, 2) elimination of unintentional artificial selection and domestication, 3) tagging of juvenile individuals released and control of their survival in natural conditions.

AB  - The abundance of aquatic vegetation is increasing in rivers and lakes worldwide. The aim of this study was to find how the macrophyte Juncus bulbosus Linnaeus affects salmonids and benthic macroinvertebrates in Norwegian rivers. The proliferation of J. bulbosus in the study rivers commenced after the development of hydropower in the 1960s and 1970s. J. bulbosus is now considered a nuisance for humans in many areas of the rivers. We found a higher density of juvenile fish and higher density, weight and species richness of invertebrates in areas with J. bulbosus than in areas with gravel, suggesting that the vegetation is not limiting fish and invertebrates. This may be because macrophytes increase the surface area and provide shelter, food and a variety of ecological niches. Adult salmonid fish can be negatively affected when their spawning grounds are covered by vegetation. However, overgrowth is not common and may take years since fish clear the river bed of macrophytes during redd digging, indicating competition between macrophytes and fish for riverbed habitat. Our results suggest that one should not assume that outgrowths of macrophytes have negative impacts on the ecosystem. It is important to map all impacts and distinguish nuisance to humans from effects on the ecosystem. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Primates often consume either bark or cambium (inner bark) as a fallback food to complete their diet during periods of food scarcity. Wild chimpanzees exhibit great behavioral diversity across Africa, as studies of new populations frequently reveal. Since 2014, we have been using a combination of camera traps and indirect signs to study the ecology and behavior of wild chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) in Comoé National Park, Ivory Coast, to document and understand the behavioral adaptations that help them to survive in a savanna–forest mosaic landscape. We found that Comoé chimpanzees peel the bark of the buttresses of kapok tree (Ceiba pentandra) trees to eat the cambium underneath. Individuals of all sex/age classes across at least six neighboring communities peeled the bark, but only during the late rainy season and beginning of the dry season, when cambium may represent an important fallback food. Baboons (Papio anubis) also target the same trees but mainly eat the bark itself. Most of the bark-peeling wounds on Ceiba trees healed completely within 2 years, seemingly without any permanent damage. We recorded chimpanzees visiting trees in early stages of wound recovery but leaving them unpeeled. Only 6% of peeled trees (N = 53) were reexploited after a year, suggesting that chimpanzees waited for the rest of the trees to regrow the bark fully before peeling them again, thus using them sustainably. Many human groups of hunter-gatherers and herders exploited cambium sustainably in the past. The observation that similar sustainable bark-peeling behavior evolved in both chimpanzees and humans suggests that it has an important adaptive value in harsh environments when other food sources become seasonally scarce, by avoiding the depletion of the resource and keeping it available for periods of scarcity.

AB  - Atmospheric rivers (ARs), defined as narrow, transient corridors of strong moisture transport in the lower troposphere, are important phenomena for freshwater recharge and water resources, especially along the west coast of North America. This study presents the variability and trends of landfalling ARs (LARs) along the higher (53.5°–60.0°N) and lower (47.0°–53.5°N) latitudes of British Columbia and southeastern Alaska (BCSAK) during the 1948–2016 period. Moreover, we present the synoptic evolution and distribution of LARs in BCSAK during different phases of ocean–atmosphere climate variability using a six-hourly AR catalogue from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and reanalysis data from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research. During 1948–2016, BCSAK averages 35 ± 5 LARs annually, with the highest frequency during fall (13 ± 2) and lowest during spring (5 ± 2). The frequency of LARs across BCSAK rises during the study period, and the increase between 1979 and 2016 is statistically significant (p < .05). A strong ridge over the Pacific Northwest and BC and a trough over the Gulf of Alaska and the Northeastern Pacific Ocean favours AR landfalls at the higher and lower latitudes, respectively. BCSAK experiences greater numbers of LARs during neutral phases of El Niño/Southern Oscillation, the 2013/2014 Pacific oceanic blob, and during the positive phases of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and Pacific North American Pattern.

AB  - Positioned in British Columbia on the west coast of Canada, Kitimat smelter is in operation for more than 60 years. A new era has started with the modernization of the smelter using the AP40 smelting technology. AP40 technology has already been successfully used in the Alma (Canada) smelter enabling operation above 400 kA. The new Kitimat potline, with its 384 pots, started production mid-2015 and reached full capacity in March 2016. The robust start-up has been successfully concluded with a performance test achieving 96.1% Current Efficiency and 12,800 kWh/t of Specific Energy Consumption. Thanks to new AP40 potline, the Kitimat production increases by about 48% to 420,000 tons annually while the smelter’s overall emissions have been halved. Kitimat smelter is now one of the most efficient, greenest and lowest-cost in the world.

AB  - In Canada, inequities persist in the provision of safe drinking water on First Nation reserves. First Nation reserve communities are creating opportunities and initiating various strategies for youth to connect with others to learn and share knowledge of water resource management, protection and stewardship, and community water issues. Community-based research projects facilitate opportunities for youths’ voices to be heard and cultural resilience to be enhanced. This project facilitated the sharing of youth perspectives on values associated with water and health on their reserve as a part of a larger research program. Modified Photovoice, herein called Postervoice, and sharing circles occurred with 19 Junior Rangers. Connections between their knowledge of water and perceptions about how water pertains to overall health were shared. Youth valued the aesthetics of on-reserve water assets, were averse to polluted waters and the risk of losing opportunities to undertake traditional activities, and exhibited pride for their water treatment plant. Implications for community leaders, policy makers, and researchers are discussed.

AB  - We are at a key juncture in history where biodiversity loss is occurring daily and accelerating in the face of population growth, climate change, and rampant development. Simultaneously, we are just beginning to appreciate the wealth of human health benefits that stem from experiencing nature and biodiversity. Here we assessed the state of knowledge on relationships between human health and nature and biodiversity, and prepared a comprehensive listing of reported health effects. We found strong evidence linking biodiversity with production of ecosystem services and between nature exposure and human health, but many of these studies were limited in rigor and often only correlative. Much less information is available to link biodiversity and health. However, some robust studies indicate that exposure to microbial biodiversity can improve health, specifically in reducing certain allergic and respiratory diseases. Overall, much more research is needed on mechanisms of causation. Also needed are a re-envisioning of land-use planning that places human well-being at the center and a new coalition of ecologists, health and social scientists and planners to conduct research and develop policies that promote human interaction with nature and biodiversity. Improvements in these areas should enhance human health and ecosystem, community, as well as human resilience.

In the McConnell Creek area of north-central British Columbia, the assemblage consists of plagioclase-clinopyroxene-phyric, dominantly basaltic to andesitic flows and pyroclastic rocks, interlayered with volcanogenic sedimentary rocks. Compositionally, the volcanic rocks are intermediate between tholeiitic and calc-alkaline. Their mantle-normalized trace element patterns are characterized by a moderate large-ion lithophile element enrichment and Nb and Ti depletion, suggesting that magmatism occurred in a volcanic-arc setting. Flat, heavy rare earth element chondrite-normalized patterns with (La/Yb)n ratios from 2 to 4.5 suggest that the parent magma was produced by mantle melting in the spinel stability field.

AB  - We used a wavelength dispersive microprobe to describe patterns in otolith microchemistry of sockeye salmon (Oncorhyncbus nerka). Patterns in Sr/Ca ratios in transects across otoliths were consistent with changes in environmental chemistry associated with life history. The patterns we observed were consistent with those described for other salmonids. We found that Sr/Ca ratios in otolith primordia of fish of known anadromous origin were significantly higher than those in otolith primordia of fish of known resident origin. However, variation among samples was associated with differences in chemistry of the freshwater environments. These differences could confound attempts to discriminate sympatric resident and anadromous forms in lakes where Sr/Ca ratios are high. Samples used to discriminate origin of emigrants from Redfish Lake, Idaho, confirmed the presence of both resident and anadromous fish, but the two groups were not clearly resolved. Otolith microchemistry has the potential to determine the parent..., Nous avons utilisé une microsonde à dispersion de longueur d'ondes pour décrire les profils de la microchimie des otolithes chez le saumon rouge (Oncorhynchus nerka). Les profils des rapports Sr/Ca dans les coupes transversales des otolithes concordaient avec les modifications de la chimie environnementale pendant le cycle vital des poissons. Les profils observés concordaient avec ceux qui ont été décrits pour d'autres salmonidés. Nous avons trouvé que les rapports Sr/Ca dans les primordia des otolithes de poissons dont on connaissait l'origine anadrome étaient nettement plus élevés que chez les poissons connus comme résidents. Toutefois, la variation parmi les échantillons est associée à des différences dans la chimie des milieux dulcicoles. Ces différences pourraient entraver les efforts déployés pour distinguer les formes résidentes et anadromes sympatriques dans les lacs où les rapports Sr/Ca sont élevés.

AB  - Context: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health concern and has reached epidemic proportions in the Canadian First Nation population. Reasons for this epidemic are the consequences of low socioeconomic status, and challenges to screening, primary prevention, management and access to care.Issue: This article presents the authors’ opinions of the healthcare needs specific to the First Nation population in Canada with respect to management of T2D.Lessons learned: The authors argue that the current Canadian Diabetes Association Clinical Practice Guidelines are insufficient to provide a basis for health care and funding policies related to T2D management in the First Nation population. The authors present their own recommendations in relation to funding policies and the appropriateness of services for the First Nation population. Key words: Canada, community-based interventions, First Nation, health promotion, knowledge exchange, participatory research, Type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Fin rays offer a viable alternative to scales and otoliths for determining ages of threatened salmonids, but information on potential side effects from their removal is limited. We conducted a laboratory study to assess the effects of removal of three pelvic fin rays on the survival and growth of two age-groups of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus (age 3: 209–298 mm standard length [SL]; age 4: 294–362 mm SL). Survival was similar between fin-ray-excised fish (≥73%) and control fish (≥69%) at each stage during the 169-d study (P > 0.85). Survival was also similar within age-3 (fin ray excision: ≥39%; control: ≥30%; P > 0.42) and age-4 bull trout (fin ray excision: ≥94%; control: ≥94%; P > 0.86), although a bacterial coldwater infection disproportionately caused higher mortality in age-3 fish for both test groups. Growth also did not differ between treatment and control groups of either age-3 or age-4 fish (P > 0.38). The fin excision wound was completely healed in 56% of treatment fish by day 33 and in 96% by day 126. Excised fin rays regenerated at the rate of 0.25% per day in 92% of treatment fish, attaining nearly one-half (42%) of the estimated total length by the end of the study; 90% regeneration was predicted to occur in about 13 months. Results suggest that removal of pelvic fin rays for aging is probably not deleterious to bull trout over the size range examined.

AB  - Over the last thirty years, Aboriginal peoples, forestry companies and governments in Canada have developed a wide variety of arrangements and mechanisms aimed at fostering collaboration and establishing an increasing Aboriginal role in managing and harvesting forestlands. This paper seeks to facilitate the analysis and investigation of various forms of collaboration by presenting a typology based upon institutional arrangements and desired outcomes. Development of the typology followed an iterative process of categorisation, description, testing and revision, using scientific and grey literature combined with testing against an ever-widening number of communities; firstly in Quebec, then in six provinces and finally with 474 communities across the country. We identify five principal forms of collaborative arrangement, each with a number of sub-types: treaties and other formal agreements that establish roles and responsibilities; planning and management activities; influence on decision-making; forest tenures; and economic roles. The application and utility of this typology is illustrated through the examples of four communities, each of which is engaged in several different collaborative arrangements. The typology demonstrates the variety of arrangements that are available to encourage Aboriginal involvement in Canada's forest sector while also provided a basis for future work in comparing the benefits of different arrangements or in analysing the effectiveness of policies.

AB  - In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: Twenty-First-Century Debt Collectors: Idle No More Combats a Five-Hundred-Year-Old Debt Amanda Morris (bio) Self-determination. Survival. Sovereignty. These are the principles driving the Idle No More movement and the ideas that have consistently driven Indigenous peoples in North America to fight against their colonizers’ destructive designs on their bodies, lands, and spirits. From the genocidal actions of Manifest Destiny and residential boarding schools to Sand Creek, Wounded Knee, and reservations, the governments of the United States and Canada have persistently colonized the Indigenous peoples of this continent in word and deed. Idle No More is an ongoing grassroots effort created by four First Nations women in Canada that has attracted global attention and support. On its website, the group calls for the repeal of provisions in Bill C-45, which became law in 2013, “(including changes to the Indian Act and Navigable Waters Act, which infringe on environmental protections, Aboriginal and Treaty rights) and abandon all pending legislation which does the same.” In cooperation with Defenders of the Land, this growing Indigenous network also calls on Canada to increase proportional representation with regard to “all legislation concerning collective rights and environmental protections”; to live up to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and to “respect the right of Indigenous peoples to say no to development on their territory”; and to “officially repudiate the racist Doctrine of Discovery and the Doctrine of Terra Nullius and abandon their use to justify the seizure of Indigenous Nations’ lands and wealth” (Idle No More 2013). The “vision” of Idle No More seems simple: “Idle No More calls on all people to join in a peaceful revolution, to honour Indigenous sovereignty, and to protect the land and water.” However, peaceful revolution is a complicated goal [End Page 242] that requires an understanding of why these women were motivated to act in November 2012. Click for larger view View full resolution Idle No More by Kevin Konnyu. Indigenous women lead their communities with visionary leadership skills; deep cultural knowledge; and a central focus on spiritual faith, honesty, and integrity. As they have since before the European invasion, Indigenous women are responsible for the health of their communities and have always taken this role seriously. Under continued assault from external and male-dominated political forces, such as the Indian Act, Indigenous women need to possess and exercise forms of political empowerment to maintain and improve the day-to-day lives of their people. Idle No More presents an Indigenous vision of politics that surpasses the control that state sovereignty has over contemporary Aboriginal life. The women leading Idle No More are twenty-first-century debt collectors who have created an attention-grabbing model for decolonial Indigenous feminism that builds upon a rich history of Indigenous resistance to colonial control over land, culture, and lives: a movement that empowers Indigenous women on the path to achieving social justice for Indigenous nations. As other contemporary movements respond and react to injustice and the trampling of rights through street protests and occupation of public spaces, the Idle No More movement is trying to shift the contemporary discourses of rights, [End Page 243] sovereignty, and nationhood by arguing that it is Indigenous women who ought to ultimately hold the political power of Indigenous nations, or at the very least have an equal seat at the debate table. According to Leanne Simpson in Dancing on Our Turtle’s Back: Stories of Nishnaabeg Re-creation, Resurgence and a New Emergence, “Western-based social movement theory has failed to recognize the broader contextualizations of resistance within Indigenous thought, while also ignoring the contestation of colonialism as a starting point. … Part of being Indigenous in the 21st century is that regardless of where or how we have grown up, we’ve all been bathed in a vat of cognitive imperialism, perpetuating the idea that Indigenous Peoples were not, and are not, thinking peoples—an insidious mechanism to promote neo-assimilation and obfuscate the historic atrocities of colonialism” (2011, 32). In this respect, Indigenous nationhood entails a fundamentally different understanding of political power than that seen in Western European–style politics.

AB  - Some environmental ethicists and economists argue that attributing infinite value to the environment is a good way to represent an absolute obligation to protect it. Others argue against modelling the value of the environment in this way: the assignment of infinite value leads to immense technical and philosophical difficulties that undermine the environmentalist project. First, there is a problem of discrimination: saving a large region of habitat is better than saving a small region; yet if both outcomes have infinite value, then decision theory prescribes indifference. Second, there is a problem of swamping probabilities: an act with a small but positive probability of saving an endangered species appears to be on par with an act that has a high probability of achieving this outcome, since both have infinite expected value. Our paper shows that a relative (rather than absolute) concept of infinite value can be meaningfully defined, and provides a good model for securing the priority of the natural environment while avoiding the failures noted by sceptics about infinite value. Our claim is not that the relative infinity utility model gets every detail correct, but rather that it provides a rigorous philosophical framework for thinking about decisions affecting the environment.

AB  - This article summarizes several examples of management approaches used by First Nations currently managing for non-timber forest resources (NTFRs). It outlines recurring themes that underlie these approaches, and highlights noteworthy accomplishments or concepts of potential relevance to natural resource policy, planning, and management. A central argument is that to understand how First Nations manage for NTFRs and why they often choose not to maximize profitability of commercially useful products, you must first understand the relationship between First Nations and their territories. The article concludes with the recommendation that land use decision makers collaborate more with First Nations and consider incorporating their approaches to realize the social, economic, and ecological benefits stemming from holistic stewardship of NTFRs.

AB  - This paper discusses contemporary issues surrounding the efficiency of environmental assessment (EA) and the effectiveness of community engagement with focus on Canadian practice in the last two decades. Based on a review of the EA literature, we provide a brief overview of the benefits of effective engagement in EA processes. We then identify and discuss three enduring challenges to effective engagement amidst increasing pressures for a more efficient EA process, namely capacity, streamlining of EA processes, and the timing of EA and engagement in the resource development process. The paper concludes with key recommendations to ensure community engagement as a platform for enhancing increased inclusivity in environmental decision making. The paper is part of a special collection of brief discussion papers presented at the 2014 Walleye Seminar held in Northern Saskatchewan, which explored consultation and engagement with northern communities and stakeholders in resource development.

AB  - AbstractDespite much attention, aboriginal governments in Canada have not yet been the focus of comprehensive, sustained and focussed research on the part of the academic and aboriginal communities. In this article 14 areas which require study are cited under three major headings: aboriginal communities and their governments, the components of governance and the wider policy environment. These clusters of research subjects are related in a systematic fashion. A selection of the literature is placed in context and practical suggestions for fostering co-operative approaches to research are suggested. Throughout, it is argued that a critical focus for such efforts on the part of political scientists, other scholars and analysts should be placed on the needs, experiences and goals of aboriginal peoples and their governments.,

TI  - Linking fluvial dynamics to white sturgeon habitat in the Nechako River, BC.
TY  - thesis
AU  - Gauthier-Fauteux, Simon
AB  - Considerable effort has been dedicated to restoring sturgeon habitat within dammed rivers. However, sedimentation causes long-term failure because interstitial voids provide critical habitat during early life-stages. Based on the premise that a better understanding of geomorphic processes will improve restoration design, this study characterizes flow and sediment transport dynamics through a white sturgeon spawning reach on the Nechako River, BC. An extensive dataset was collected throughout the 2015 flood. Bedload transport was sampled on 36 days with flows ranging from 44 m³/s to 656 m³/s. During a high flow of 525 m³/s, channel bathymetry and water surface elevation were surveyed and velocity profiles were collected across 9 transects. Banklines, bars and island topography were later surveyed during low flow. Sediment transport into the reach was positively related with discharge. This relation was non-linear and transport rates increased rapidly once flows exceeded 400 m³/s. The relation weakened with downstream distance and sediment transport peaked progressively later throughout the year. No relation was observed at the downstream end of the reach, where transport rates remained low and constant relative to upstream. Sediment was primarily transported through secondary channels conveying a disproportionate amount of sediment compared to flow. Within the single-thread channel, the locations conveying the greatest amount of sediment remained spatially consistent over time. Hydrodynamic modelling indicates the Burrard Ave. Bridge causes backwatering once discharge exceed 225-275 m³/s. Velocity, shear stress and transport capacity at the downstream end of the reach do not increase with discharge because of the backwatering and the expansion in channel width through the island complex. The locations of maximum shear stress and transport capacity shift upstream with increasing discharge, but shear stress does not exceed 23 N/m² for flows up to 775 m³/s. The fluvial dynamics within the spawning reach create challenges and opportunities for habitat restoration. Backwatering is problematic because it causes mid-reach deposition during high flows and limits shear stress magnitude over the downstream spawning substrate. Meanwhile, the presence of sediment transport pathways through secondary channels and within the mainstem can be used to site restoration projects in areas apt to maintain suitable habitat.

AB  - The principles of ownership, control, access and possession (OCAP) crystallize themes long advocated by First Nations in Canada. Coined by the Steering Committee of the First Nations Regional Longitudinal Health Survey, the principles are discussed as an expression of self-determination in research. The key notions outlined in this paper relate to the collective ownership of group information; First Nations control over research and information; First Nations' management of access to their data and physical possession of the data. Following a critical review of colonial research practices and recent institutional efforts to improve ethics in Aboriginal research, this paper highlights policies and strategies adopted by First Nations organizations - approaches which offer a way out of the muddle of contemporary Aboriginal research and the ethical dilemmas that characterize it. The benefits of OCAP are described including the rebuilding of trust, improved research quality and relevance, decreased bias, meaningful capacity development, and community empowerment to make change.

AB  - Collaboration between anthropologists and the Canoe Creek and High Bar First Nations resulted in the excavation and identification of a radiocarbon-dated 5,000-year-old human burial, one of only six Middle Period burials now known from three Canadian Plateau sites. The burial appears to have been an isolated mortuary occurrence but with a pattern of body disposition similar to China Lake (EiRm-7) and Pritchard (EeQw-21). Osteological analysis indicated an elderly female (sex confirmed by molecular testing) with age-related pathological changes. A comprehensive comparative review of known Canadian Plateau human remains, included in this study, revealed an individual of relatively short stature with strongly developed upper limbs. Stable isotope analysis (carbon and nitrogen) pointed to a predominantly terrestrial diet likely based on hunting, with a moderate intake of marine protein, presumably salmon. Testing for mitochondrial DNA indicated haplogroup A, which is widespread in living Native Americans. Comparative mtDNA data suggest long-standing genetic continuity in the Pacific Northwest, but with evidence for a genetically diverse population in existence at 5000 BP.

TI  - New Relationships on the Northwest Frontier: Episodes in the Gitxsan and Witsuwit'en Encounter with Colonial Power
TY  - thesis
AU  - McCreary, Tyler Allan
AB  - This dissertation examines relationships between colonialism and Indigenous peoples that shape the development of extractive resources in Gitxsan and Witsuwit’en territories in Northwest British Columbia, Canada. I argue colonialism and Indigeneity are co-constituted. Theoretically, this dissertation brings an analysis of colonialism into conversation with Foucauldian understandings of sovereign, disciplinary, and governmental power. I begin by situating the relationship between colonialism and the Gitxsan and Witsuwit’en people historically, then transition to examine in greater detail the contemporary relations unfolding through the courts, traditional knowledge studies, resource governance, and education. I argue the Gitxsan and Witsuwit’en assertions of territory and jurisdiction in the Delgamuukw litigation exposed Indigenous traditions to new forms of colonial discipline and debasement but also induced new regimes of recognition and doctrines of reconciliation. Subsequently, Aboriginal traditional knowledge studies integrated recognition of Indigeneity within the governmental regulation of resource development. However, such recognition has been constrained. Witsuwit’en resistance to the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project highlights the ongoing emergence of Indigenous politics in excess of regulatory integration as traditional. This excess is continually reincorporated into colonial governance processes to resecure development, through not only techniques aimed at protecting Indigenous traditions but also training regimes designed to incorporate Indigenous labour within the industrial economy. Through the dissertation, I demonstrate the entanglement of resource development with a continuous cycle moving through moments of Indigenous contestation, colonial response, and subsequent Indigenous challenges. This cycle has relied on the exercise of sovereignty, disciplinarity, and governmentality as distinct yet interpenetrated modalities of colonial power. Colonial sovereignty operates to suspend the political excess of Indigenous political claims, discipline works to enframe Indigeneity, and government minimally regulates to protect and foster Indigenous being. However, on the basis that Indigenous forms of territory and subjectivity remain unreconciled with colonial regimes of discipline and governmentality, Indigenous authorities perpetually advance new jurisdictional claims that problematize those of the colonial sovereign, and reopen spaces of negotiation. I suggest the movement between moments of resistance and reconciliation remains necessarily open and indeterminate. These multiple trajectories of the encounter between Indigenous peoples and colonialism, I argue, continually unfold to constitute the colonial present.

TI  - The phonetics and phonology of Lheidli intervocalic consonants
TY  - thesis
AU  - Bird, Sonya F.
AB  - This dissertation The phonetics and phonology of Lheidli intervocalic consonants. Through a series of studies on Lheidli, I show quantitatively what has previously been noted impressionistically in the Athapaskan literature: intervocalic consonants are remarkably long. The implication of these consonants for the structure of Lheidli is approached from two perspectives. First, I investigate their role from a purely phonetic approach, focusing on their effect on the perceived rhythmic structure of Lheidli. I propose a new model of rhythm, the Enhancement/Inhibition model, in which the perception of rhythm is created by the interplay between primary and secondary correlates of rhythm. Within the proposed model, the Lheidli data show that one of the important secondary correlates is inherent segmental duration, an element that has not yet been considered in the literature. Second, I investigate the role of intervocalic consonants from a phonological approach, focusing on their effect on syllabification. I present the results of a series of studies on the distribution of vowel duration and quality, the distribution of consonant duration, native speaker syllabification intuitions, and the interaction between stress placement and intervocalic consonant duration. Together these studies lead me to analyze Lheidli intervocalic consonants as non-contrastive, moraic geminates. I conclude by discussing the implications of the Lheidli data for phonetic and phonological theory. I argue the duration of intervocalic consonants is encoded in the Lheidli grammar as part of the language-specific phonetics. Furthermore, because this duration interacts with syllabification, it is encoded in the phonology as weight. Although in Lheidli the phonetic duration of intervocalic consonants is encoded in the phonology as well as the grammar, I propose that not all language-specific phonetic properties are specified in the grammar. This is the case for rhythm, for example, which is an effect of other phonetic and phonological factors of the language rather than being a linguistic primitive itself.

TI  - Public Participation, Petro-Politics and Indigenous Peoples : The Contentious Northern Gateway Pipeline and Joint Review Panel Process
TY  - thesis
AU  - Stendie, Larissa
AB  - The Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipeline (NGP) is the proposed 1177 km link to bring crude bitumen from the Alberta Tar Sands over to the BC coast for Asian-bound super-tankers, presenting unique risks; crossing 1000+ salmon bearing waterways, tunneling two mountains, navigating the world’s 4th most dangerous waterway along the Great Bear Rainforest, and through 30 Indigenous territories. The Joint Review Panel (JRP) is a public consultation reviewing the project in ‘a careful and precautionary manner,’ consulting citizens and Aboriginal Groups to determine NGP’s necessity, public interest, and environmental impacts, to produce recommendations. Such panels can be beneficial, however, new legislation means decision-making rests with Neoliberal-oriented Federal government who can ignore the report. Extractive industries have disproportionate access and influence over Canadian policy, so though consultations occur, the structures inhibit citizen’s capacity to contest privileged interests. Many Indigenous Peoples, citizens, municipalities, unions, scientists, and economists have denounced the JRPs legitimacy, promising legal action and vowing to fight NGP on the ground. FPIC and Deliberative Democracy were used to analyze the JRP in a political ecology framework. I argue participation is not synonymous with meaningful negotiation; participation is being included at the table but fails to define the value of input, resulting in a passive exercise of agency - relegated to tokenism or worse, spectatorship. Fairness, access and justice should be minimum standards in consultations, so preoccupations with legalism and procedures attempt to realize these standards in complex pluralistic, multicultural, post-colonial societies in practice, but fail. Legal mechanisms do not automatically provide equality and procedural elements can facilitate systemic exclusion. Relying on fair procedures then denying the results of difficult negotiations negates the worth of challenging and costly participation. Canada’s national vision must move beyond extractive capitalism; the unified opposition not viewed as adversarial, but instead legitimizing a mandate to support transitioning towards a sustainable future.

AB  - This research is the first empirical study that focuses on corporate governance structures of community-owned corporations on First Nations reserves in British Columbia. Communityowned corporations are social enterprises which serve the goals of the community, such as education and employment creation. This exploratory research uses questionnaires, in-depth semi-structured interviews, a size index and a logit model to analyze corporate governance structures of business entities. The semi-structured interviews were used to examining three corporate governance models for business entities on First Nations reserves: the traditional native model, the development corporation model, and the modern native model. We find a close relationship between corporate goals and community goals and a close interaction between Band governance and corporate governance. Our empirical evidence indicates that the native corporate model is common in small communities in British Columbia where businesses are closely controlled by the Band government. In larger communities a development corporation or a modern native corporate model with more self-governance of businesses exists.

AB  - There is a fundamental assertion by indigenous communities, which is now beginning to be recognized globally, that “we belong to the land.” The position of indigenous people, both locally and globally, as traditional knowledge holders and legal entities with rights and title to lands is challenging the authority of nation states in the development and management of lands and resources. International bodies, such as the United Nations and World Bank, continually place emphasis on bridging the implementation gap between the inclusion and exclusion of indigenous communities in public policy. However, increasing tensions exhibited between indigenous nations and nation states continue to surface. Much needs to be written about the shortsightedness of state governments that continue to ignore indigenous rights and title and the perils that await them. This paper will focus on a small part of this larger question, examining the emerging struggle of legal recognition of indigenous title, rights and cosmologies into the Canadian body politics as it relates to environmental policy. In addition to broad policy implications associated with the acceptance of indigenous people's knowledge, there are also ethical issues of “integrating” traditional knowledge as well as practical problems with “implementing” traditional environmental knowledge (TEK) into legal and regulatory environmental regimes, practices and policies. A significant new way to examine these questions is to examine them through an Aboriginal resource planning approach. This approach will be formalized in relations to current activity in British Columbia, Canada, where Aboriginal communities and two levels of Canadian government are negotiating a balance between indigenous and state aspirations to find complimentary and sustainable mechanisms for environmental assessments.

TI  - Proud Voices : an Analysis of First Nation Oppostiion to the Northern Gateway Pipeline Project
TY  - thesis
AU  - Johnson, Kevin
AB  - This thesis examines dynamics between indigenous populations and modern industrial development by examining sociocultural impacts that development of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project (ENGP) poses to First Nations. The ENGP proposes construction of two parallel pipelines from Alberta, Canada to the coast of British Columbia, Canada, through traditional territories of many First Nations. Most First Nations along the pipeline route maintain core aspects of their traditional subsistence culture. Reliance on renewable natural resources makes subsistence cultures informed and resilient when confronting natural disasters. However, the ENGP introduces ecological hazards which are socioculturally foreign to the First Nations, namely threats of an environmental disaster from an oil spill. As part of the Canadian government's evaluation of the ENGP, a Joint Review Panel (JRP) was tasked with evaluating potential impacts posed by the project. Part of this evaluation process involved hearings at which First Nations offered their perspectives on the project, primarily how the ENGP would affect their way of life. Using transcriptions of these testimonies as data, common discursive themes used by First Nations were determined and used to understand the sociocultural impacts of the ENGP as they are perceived by the First Nations. Three First Nations bands are examined: the Gitga'at of Hartley Bay, British Columbia, Canada, and the Lake Babine and Wet'suwet'en of Burns Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Theme usage is compared and contrasted between groups. Differences in narrative theme usage are observed between groups, which are attributed to bioregional differences and varying experiences in sociocultural history. While both groups unanimously opposed the ENGP and had similar proportions of theme use, the Gitga'at were more explicit in their discussions of threats to resources, and the Lake Babine and Wet'suwet'en were more emphatic on issues of sovereignty.

AB  - Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Natural Resource Management examines how traditional ecological knowledge (TEK) is taught and practiced today among Native communities. Of special interest is the complex relationship between indigenous ecological practices and other ways of interacting with the environment, particularly regional and national programs of natural resource management. Focusing primarily on the northwest coast of North America, scholars look at the challenges and opportunities confronting the local practice of indigenous ecological knowledge in a range of communities, including the Tsimshian, the Nisgaêa, the Tlingit, the Gitksan, the Kwagult, the Sto:lo, and the northern Dene in the Yukon. The experts consider how traditional knowledge is taught and learned and address the cultural importance of different subsistence practices using natural elements such as seaweed (Gitgaêa), pine mushrooms (Tsimshian), and salmon (Tlingit). Several contributors discuss the extent to which national and regional programs of resource management need to include models of TEK in their planning and execution. This volume highlights the different ways of seeing and engaging with the natural world and underscores the need to acknowledge and honor the ways that indigenous peoples have done so for generations.

AU  - Penikett, Tony
SN  - 978-1-926706-29-0
AB  - In the hundred years since British Columbia joined Confederation, Canada has negotiated only one treaty in the province. A decade after signing the Nisga&#39;a treaty, and despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars, the BC Treaty Commission process had not finalized a single treaty. This impassioned book explains why.The long answer to the question, says author Tony Penikett, is rooted in colonial history: provincial resistance, federal indifference and judicial equivocation. The short answer is that Canadian governments have wanted treaties solely on their own terms. Drawing on three decades of experience as a negotiator and a politician, Penikett argues persuasively that successful treaty making requires not only principled mandates, imaginative negotiators and skilled mediators, but also the political will to redress First Nation grievances. The treaty process in BC is ailing, this book shows clearly, and Penikett has many practical remedies to offer.

Pp. xviii, 306, illus. $65.00 cloth, $34.95 paper It has been over eighty years since the Great War of 1914-1918 ended, yet we continue to be fascinated, if not intrigued, with it as a subject. Within the past twenty-five years, soldiers' experiences have formed a more important part ofthe interpretation ofthat conflict, owing in great measure to the work of Paul Fussell, John Keegan, Denis Winter, and Lyn Macdonald. British historians have taken the lead. Canadian historians have been slow offthe mark, with the notable exception ofDesmond Morton, Jonathan Vance, and the late Sandra Gwyn. Given this dearth, these two publications are a welcome addition. They make a significant contribution to our understanding ofhow the Great War affected those who were part of it. One cannot come away from reading these books without a strong impression ofhow horrible war can be. We expect a diary to be a daily record, especially a personal record of events, experiences, and observations. Ifwe are lucky, a diary might also offer insights into the character and personality of the writer. In this particular instance we are fortunate in that both Vanier and Gass reveal something of themselves in their writings over the war years and leave lasting impressions ofhow the conflict affected them personally. Cowley and Mann are not military historians, but they show a particular flair for putting the diaries and letters into a proper context. Both provide solid introductions, appropriate biographical detail, good illustrations , and notes that complement the text. Mann also includes helpful detail on the routines ofthe nursing service during the war, making that account a valuable source in medical history. Both authors have remained faithful to their sources, keeping intact the structure and content of the letters and diaries, including, in the case of Gass, the writer's spelling mistakes. What the reader is left with is an unadulterated copy of the writings of two remarkable young Canadians whose lives were shaped by the events they recorded. Georges Vanier was the son of an upper-class Montreal family, the offspring ofan Irish mother and a French Canadian father. Vanier was a cultivated man, a product ofthe rich heritage oftwo cultural and linguistic traditions. When war broke out, few French Canadians rallied to the call. Vanier and the young men who joined the 22nd (French Canadian) Book Reviews 763 Battalion, the famous 'Van Doos,' were the exception. Vanier's reasons for enlisting were clear: 'We were a group representing the descendants ofthe French language in a war where the life of France was threatened ... We believed that the best way of showing one's love for one's motherland was to go to her defence even at the risk of one's life.' It was a mission he never lost sight ofthroughout the war. Vanier's account of his war experience is upbeat and unemotional. Supremely optimistic, Vanier never doubted the favourable outcome of the war. As for his reaction to events, especially those bringing personal loss or even grief, his response was almost stoical. As a result, one is left with the impression that the diary and letters reveal nothing ofthe inner workings of the man, of his emotional response to events, and of his feelings for others. And yet, over the course of the war, those qualities that endeared him to a later generation of Canadians begin to take shape: the remarkable self-control, the discipline, the sense of duty and purpose, of service to a higher ideal. Suffering shell shock in 1916, he insisted on returning to the battlefield where he felt his responsibility lay, even though he could have gone home. While leading the Van Doos into battle in the final months of the war, Vanier lost a leg and had to be hospitalized. Undeterred, he continued to send home cheerful notes to his family which carefully disguised the terrible effects ofa long, painful recovery...

AB  - The sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) which is native to the Pacific rim from California to Kamchatka is the most valuable single species in the British Columbia fishery. Recently catches have ranged from 2 to 7 million fish with a lauded value of %4-%16 million annually, and have generally constituted 20–30% by value of total landings. Sockeye salmon, like other anadromous fish, provide greater opportunities for research to have an impact on their management than do most marine species. On the one hand, they are particularly susceptible to the adverse influences of excessive fishing and of changes in the freshwater environment, both of which provide scope for remedial management. On the other hand, during the freshwater phases, they are relatively easy to observe and, particularly during migrations, there are exceptionally good opportunities for quantitative assessment of populations. In Canada, research has contributed directly to the management of sockeye salmon in at least the following ways 1. By maintaining or increasing the productivity of the accessible freshwater environment through— (a) identifying and providing means of overcoming barriers to access to spawning and rearing grounds, e.g., Hell's Gate Rapids; (b) identifying situations in which potential rearing capacity exceeds the output of existing spawning grounds, e.g., Babine Lake; (c) identifying the essential features of productive spawning grounds and so providing a basis for construction of additional spawning grounds to meet the above situation, e.g., spawning channels; (d) identifying situations in which the productive capacity of rearing lakes is inadequate for the spawning grounds and devising remedial measures, e.g., Great Central Lake; (e) providing a basis for assessing potential adverse effects of proposed environment modifications and thus for opposing or modifying such actions, e.g., hydroelectric development. 2. By understanding the relationship between spawning escapement and size of the next generation, thus providing a basis for determining the optimum escapement level for each stock. 3. By identifying the origin of fish occurring in the fishery or in the ocean at various times and places. This identification provides a basis, both for regulation to obtain optimum escapements to individual runs, and for the appropriate sharing of ocean catches between salmon-producing nations, e.g., United States and Canadian coho salmon (O. kisutch) fisheries, and high seas salmon fisheries under the International North Pacific Fisheries Commission. While much research has been aimed directly at the solution of these practical problems, it could not have achieved these ends without the background of much past and present research on all aspects of the biology and life history of the species.

AB  - Data on sampling variability in smolt abundance for Babine Lake sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) are combined with a previous analysis to calculate a more accurate estimate of the degree of nonlinearity in the relation between smolts and adults. Results indicate significant within-stock nonlinear mortality, large variability in mortality which tends to obscure any smolt-to-adult relation, or both. Analysis of age structure data identifies the first 15 mo of marine life as the period when most of this nonlinear or relation-masking mortality occurs. I also calculate the amount of smolt measurement error below which other salmon stocks are classed as having nonlinear marine survival. A distinct separation between even and odd brood year marine survival of Babine Lake sockeye suggests interactions with pink salmon. Juvenile pink salmon (O. gorbuscha) abundances correlate positively with residuals in Babine Lake sockeye survival for the same seaward migration year. This suggests a depensatory mortality effe..., Combinées à une analyse antérieure, les données sur la variabilité de l'échantillonnage de l'abondance des smolts de saumon nerka (Oncorhynchus nerka) du lac Babine ont permis d'estimer plus précisément le degré de non-linéarité de la relation entre smolts et adultes. Les résultats indiquent qu'il y a forte mortalité non linéaire parmi le stock, qu'une grande variabilité de la mortalité tend à obscurcir toute relation entre smolts et adultes, ou que les deux peuvent se produire. D'après l'analyse de la structure par âge, on constate que les 15 premiers mois de vie en mer sont ceux pendant lesquels se produit la plus grande partie de cette mortalité non linéaire ou la mortalité masquant la relation. Nous calculons également l'erreur de mesure d'abondance des saumons au-dessous de laquelle d'autres stocks de cette espèce sont considérés comme ayant une survie en mer non linéaire.

TI  - Polymorphic population of Oncorhynchus nerka at Babine Lake, B.C. involving anadromous (sockeye) and non-anadromous (kokanee) forms
TY  - thesis
AU  - McCart, Peter James
AB  - The sockeye and kokanee are, respectively, the anadromous and non-anadromous forms of the Pacific salmon species, Oncorhynchus nerka. Both life historytypes inhabit Babine Lake, British Columbia, a tributary of the Skeena River system. The purpose of this study was to examine the ecology, morphologyand behaviour of sockeye and kokanee in the hope that an understanding of these would provide clues to the genetic relationship of the two forms in Babine Lake.A comparison of the life histories of sockeye and kokanee at Babine Lake revealed a.number of differences. At the time they undertake their seaward migration (usually during the spring of their second summer) sockeye smolts have a mean length greater than that of same-age kokanee. Smolts have an approximately equal sex ratio while, among kokanee, males usually exceed females in abundance. As a result of better growth conditions in the ocean, sockeye, at maturity, are much larger than kokanee. Related to this basic difference in size are differences in fecundity, egg size and testis weight in each of which sockeye exceed kokanee. Laboratory experiments revealed that, regardless of the male parent, progeny of the larger sockeye eggs had an initialsize advantage over the progeny of kokanee eggs which they maintained through July of their first year. There was no conclusive evidence of differential mortality to hybrid embryos.There are differences between sockeye and kokanee in two meristic characters:number of lateral line scales and number of vertebrae.In both instances, mean values for sockeye exceed those for kokanee. It is suggested that this difference may not be genetic in origin but rather the result of differences in the amount of yolk incorporated in eggs. The two forms did not differ in gill-raker count.Electrophoretic examination of haemoglobins and muscle myogens revealed no differences between Babine Lake sockeye and kokanee.A detailed examination of the reproductive behaviour of sockeye and kokaneerevealed that they spawn sympatrically in a group of streams known as the "early streams." These are small streams which experience considerable fluctuationin water levels and spawning suitability from year to year. Sockeye and kokanee in the early streams overlap almost completely in their spawning seasonand in their distribution on the spawning grounds. Evidence is presented that hybridization does occur under natural conditions.A study of the homing performance of mature sockeye and kokanee displaced from early streams indicates that they are less likely to home than are sockeyedisplaced from Pinkut Creek, a large, stable stream in the same area. It is suggested that a reduced homing tendency might be an adaptation to the unstablenature of the early streams. Fish homing to an early stream to which access is blocked, either by low water or by an obstruction, have the alternative of entering other, nearby streams of similar type.The hypothesis which most readily encompasses the available information is that the sockeye and kokanee in the early streams at Babine Lake are part of the same polymorphic population. This polymorphism is presumably maintained by a balance of contending advantages and disadvantages. Kokanee suffer the major disadvantage of smaller size resulting in reduced fecundity, smaller egg size and, probably, reduced spawning success. However, it would appear that they persist in the early streams because they are able to utilize spawning grounds which are unavailable to sockeye under low water conditions. The existenceof such a sockeye/kokanee polymorphism and the reduced tendency to home are both thought to be genetically regulated adaptations which enable the early stream populations of O. nerka to maximize their utilization of the available spawning grounds in. the face of extreme fluctuations in the suitability of spawning streams.The hereditary mechanism which would regulate such a sockeye/kokanee polymorphism is not known. Possibly a super-gene is involved. Whatever the mechanism, it would appear that factors other than genotype can influence the tendency to smolt: females are more likely to smolt than males; larger and/or faster growing fish are more likely to smolt than smaller, slower growing fish; immature fish are more likely to smolt than those in which maturation processes have already begun.The applicability of the polymorphism hypothesis to sockeye and kokanee populations in other areas is discussed.

TI  - Geology of the Pinchi Lake area, central British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Paterson, Ian Arthur
AB  - The area mapped, 75 square miles, lies astride the Pinchi Fault near Fort St. James in central British Columbia. Northeast of the fault system is the lower Mesozoic Takla Group composed of greywackes, conglomerates and minor limestones. Southwest of the fault system is the Pennsylvanian-Permian Cache Creek Group, made up of limestones, cherts, argillites and greenstones. Between these regions, a complex northwesterly-trending fault system involves a series of elongate fault-bounded blocks of contrasting lithology and/or metamorphic grade. Rock types making up individual blocks include: (a) lawsonite-glaucophane metasediments and meta-volcanics, (b) pumpellyite-aragonite greenstones, (c) serpentinized harzburgites and dunites and (d) a sequence of amphibolitized gabbro-diabasebasalt. Boulders of lawsonite-glaucophane eclogite are also found in the area.Within the glaucophanitic rocks a metamorphic foliation (S₁) parallels the bedding and contains a mineral lineation (L₁). This foliation is deformed by F₂ folds and mullions which are accompanied by a prominent L₂ crenulate lineation. These structures are deformed by F₃ kink folds. Significant mineral assemblages within the glauco-phanitic rocks include:(i) quartz + lawsonite + sphene + phengite + glaucophane ± carbonaceous material (metacherts) (ii) aragonite + dolomite (limestones) (iii) jadeitic pyroxene + lawsonite + quartz + white mica + chlorite (metagreywacke) (iv) quartz + white mica + lawsonite ± glaucophane + pyrite + carbonaceous material (carbonaceous schists)(v) acmitic pyroxene + lawsonite + sphene + chlorite (metavolcanics) (vi) glaucophane + lawsonite + sphene + chlorite (metavolcanics).Comparison of these assemblages with experimentally determined phase equilibria favours the hypothesis that the glaucophanitic rocks formed at high lithostatic pressures and relatively low temperatures. Because there is no evidence for a metamorphic zonation with respect to the Pinchi Fault, and because metagreywackes and metavolcanics are commonly unsheared, tectonic overpressures are not considered to have contributed appreciably to the total pressure. In the late stages ofmetamorphism the fluid phase in carbonaceous schistsbecame progressively more reducing and may have containedappreciable methane. This fluid reacted with acmiticmetavolcanics (v) to give glaucophane bearing assemblages(vi). Thus high pressure mineral assemblages with high Fe³⁺/Fe²⁺ (i.e. v) existed within the metavolcanics prior to reaction with the reducing fluid. A three stage tectonic model is proposed. Firstly, during the Late Permian, a narrow wedge of Upper Paleozoic sediment was metamorphosed in the blueschist facies along an easterly dipping subduction zone approximately on the site of the Pinchi Fault. This event is considered to be contemporaneous with the formation of F₁ structures. At a higher crustal level, an ophiolite sequence of which unit (d) is a remnant was obducted over the Cache Creek Group sediments which had accumulated above the subduction zone. During the second stage, a change in the stress system converted the subduction zone into a right-lateral strike-slip or oblique-slip fault. This event marked the beginning of the F₂ deformation. Strike-slip movement resulted in formation of zones of low pressure where there were deflections or offsets in the original fault. At Pinchi, such zones were at once filled from below by diapirs of low average density consisting of subducted blueschist, serpentinized ultramafites and minor eclogite which rose in the crust to a level governed by isostasy. It is consideredthat the Middle or Upper Triassic K-Ar dates obtained from phengitic micas (211, 214, 216 and 218 ± 7 m yrs) record either the time of cooling of the uplifted blueschists or the end of the F₂ deformation. The third stage, during the Upper Triassic, involved erosion of the ophiolites exposed on a topographic high to the west of the Pinchi Fault and flysch deposition in the adjacent trough to the east.The F₃ deformation was contemporaneous with carbonatization of fault zones and possibly occurred during the Eocene.

Conspicuously lacking in the literature is knowledge of the effect of suspended sediment on egg fertilization success during spawning. Sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) and coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) salmon gametes were used to investigate the impact of different concentrations of suspended sediment particles on the ability of sperm to successfully fertilize eggs. The fertilization process was simulated using a controlled-flow water flume with concentrations of suspended particles ranging from 800 to 47 000 mg·L–1. Egg fertilization success was assessed at eyed stage after incubating eggs in the streambed in the field or in artificial laboratory egg incubation (Heath) trays.

AB  - Witsuwit'en is an endangered First Nations language, spoken in western-central British Columbia. A member of the Athapaskan family of languages, the language had been known to have some intriguing characteristics of consonant-vowel interaction, the details of which have been in dispute among scholars. Witsuwit'en Grammar presents acoustic studies of several aspects of Witsuwit'en phonetics, including vowel quality, vowel quantity, ejectives, voice quality, and stress. Information about the sound system and word structure of Witsuwit'en is also provided, revealing many unusual features not previously described in this level of detail for an Athapaskan language. Witsuwit'en has elaborate morphology, even by the standards of the Athapaskan language family. Witsuwit'en Grammar will be of interest to anthropologists interested in the history of the Athapasakan language family, linguists interested in comparative Athapaskan grammar, or any linguist interested in phonetics-phonology or phonology-morphology interaction.

AU  - Borrows, John
SN  - 978-0-8020-8501-6
AB  - Canada is covered by a system of law and governance that largely obscures and ignores the presence of pre-existing Indigenous regimes. Indigenous law, however, has continuing relevance for both Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian state. In his in-depth examination of the continued existence and application of Indigenous legal values, John Borrows suggests how First Nations laws could be applied by Canadian courts, and tempers this by pointing out the many difficulties that would occur if the courts attempted to follow such an approach. By contrasting and comparing Aboriginal stories and Canadian case law, and interweaving political commentary, Borrows argues that there is a better way to constitute Aboriginal / Crown relations in Canada. He suggests that the application of Indigenous legal perspectives to a broad spectrum of issues that confront us as humans will help Canada recover from its colonial past, and help Indigenous people recover their country. Borrows concludes by demonstrating how Indigenous peoples' law could be more fully and consciously integrated with Canadian law to produce a society where two world views can co-exist and a different vision of the Canadian constitution and citizenship can be created.

AU  - Kinch, Matthew
AU  - Kinch, Matthew
AB  - The advancement of a constructive Aboriginal agenda in the form of rights-based litigation since the recognition and affirmation of Aboriginal and treaty rights in the Constitution Act, 1982 has led to the creation of the legal doctrine of the duty to consult and accommodate. As a discipline on Crown decision-making, the legal doctrine of the duty to consult and accommodate presents a prospective pathway for the reconciliation of Crown and Aboriginal interests in resource development. While maintaining promise as a framework to provide for the full and fair consideration of Aboriginal interests in regulatory reviews, administrative decision-makers representing the Crown have made the management of legal liabilities the principal policy objective of consultation and accommodation. As a result, there is minimal incentive for administrative decision-makers to deviate from highly legalistic interpretations of common law. This standard operating procedure is steadily reinforced, as the Crown, able to efficiently reduce the risk of litigation by First Nations, permits projects without consideration of the continued and incremental diminishment of Aboriginal interests in lands and resources. The purpose of this thesis is to deconstruct processes of consultation and accommodation embedded in environmental assessment processes associated with major resource projects as a means to identify institutional arrangements that promote and provide for the full and fair consideration of Aboriginal interests in Crown decision-making.

AB  - Why did it take so long before civil lawsuits went to court for Indian Residential Schools in Canada? This paper notes that in 1857 Canada enacted a law for the "gradual civilization" of Indians. The paper questions who needed to be gradually civilized? This paper traces the major developments (gradual civilization) in Canadian law from the Second World War until the early 1990s that collectively made it possible for civil lawsuits for Indian Residential School claims to come to court. Some of the changes are directly relevant to the circumstances of racial discrimination and indigenous rights, but other changes may surprise some readers, such as Crown liability, limitation periods, class actions and more. The paper discusses briefly some of the most important indigenous rights cases and explains just how limited these "victories" were. The paper also notes that there is still a lot more civilization needed within the Canadian legal system. Hopefully, Canada's civilization will not be so gradual over the next 50 years.

TI  - Carrier settlement and subsistence in the Chinlac/Cluculz Lake area of Central British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Cranny, Michael William
AB  - This thesis examines Carrier settlement and subsistence patterns within a study area near the confluence of the Stuart and Nechako Rivers, and around Cluculz and Cobb lakes. The Carrier site at Chinlac, excavated by Charles Borden in 1950 and 1952, is important to this study and is re-examined in terms of hypothetical models which are developed to explain settlement and subsistence in the late prehistoric period, the protohistoric period, and the early historic period. In particular, a settlement system is proposed for the protohistoric period in which there are two major elements, or locations where settlement occurred, and these are at the confluence of the Stuart and Nechako Rivers and on the north shore of Cluculz lake near the outflow. In the former location, salmon were harvested, and in the latter, lake resources were harvested. The salmon procurement sites were occupied from July to November, and the lakeside locations were used for the rest of the year by the same group of people. A smaller population, different exploitive technology, and smaller archaeological sites are predicted for the late prehistoric and historic periods.The models proposed in this thesis are based on environmental, ethnographic, and historical research. In the case of the latter, the original fur traders' accounts from Fort St. James and Fort Fraser were consulted and the information used to determine changes in settlement and subsistence over time. In general, the study adhered to the direct historic approach tempered with a cultural ecological perspective.In order to verify the proposals made in the thesis, the materials and records of Borden's Chinlac excavation were re-examined, and an archaeological survey of the study area was conducted. The data tend to support the hypotheses put forward but not all could be fully tested. Artifacts from the Chinlac site confirmed that the site was occupied during the protohistoric period, and faunal remains, house type, and other indicators make a summer/ fall occupation of the site probable. Archaeological survey found 37 archaeological sites grouped in several areas. The relatively larger sites were located either at the confluence of the rivers (at and near Chinlac) or at the outflow of Cluculz Lake. Smaller sites were scattered along the north shore of the lake, along the river banks, and elsewhere. On the basis of this data, it is concluded that the two element ( binary) settlement system is appropriate for the protohistoric period.

TI  - Preventative Education for Indigenous Girls Vulnerable to the Sex Trade
TY  - thesis
AU  - Louie, Dustin
AB  - Indigenous women in Canada are drastically overrepresented in the sex trade (Cler-Cunningham & Christensen, 2001; NWAC, 2014; Saewyc, MacKay, Anderson & Drozda; Sethi, 2005; Totten, 2009), while the phenomenon is simultaneously overlooked in academia. This dissertation investigated the potential of formal education systems in preventative education for Indigenous girls vulnerable to the sex trade. Five Indigenous sex trade survivors and nineteen service providers from a partner organization in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, participated in individual unstructured interviews to collaborate in unearthing the life experiences creating vulnerability, methods of recruitment, and preventative education recommendations. The case study methods of this dissertation are steeped in the principles of Linda Tuhiwai Smith’s Decolonizing Methodologies (1999). Based on interviews, organizational documents, and scant academic literature, the life experiences creating vulnerability to the sex trade for Indigenous girls were found to be: sexual abuse, transition from reserves, prison systems, violentization, substance abuse, family disorganization/out of home placements, family in the sex trade, poverty, and poor relationship with services. Indigenous girls are recruited into the sex trade by: gang recruitment, boyfriends, female recruitment, family recruitment, meeting basic needs, substance abuse, social media, and reserve recruitment. Prevention education will be targeted to Indigenous girls from 7-13 years old in on-reserve schools. A combination of teachers, female community members, elders, role models, and service providers could teach preventative education using love, engagement, patience, and understanding. Entire families should be included in the education process as much as possible, which should apply local cultural education and ways of knowing as much as possible.

AU  - Avery, John
SN  - 978-1-63047-159-0
AB  - An insightful journey through all the biblical names of God, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Spirit. Beginning in Babel and ending with a burning Babylon, "The Name Quest" explains the significance that the different names for God have for an everyday relationship with God and for spiritual growth. The names of God are like a rainbow--each name expresses part of the spectrum of the character and attributes of God. Along the way, the author tenderly answers tough questions: Which of the Hebrew names of God is His personal name--Yahweh or Jehovah? What does it mean to pray in Jesus’ name? How can we relate to the Holy God and the Judge? Why is a God of love called the “Jealous God”? What does it mean to call Jesus the Messiah? "The Name Quest" mentions all the names of God in the Bible while explaining their significance in ordinary language. The author weaves together fifteen years of Bible study research with plentiful illustrations and humorous anecdotes. These include lessons learned as a pastor on a Caribbean island. A visit to a Welsh hill farm introduces a chapter about the Good Shepherd. The story of a Hungarian political prisoner illustrates the meaning of Immanuel (or is it Emmanuel?) A rescue from the slopes of an active volcano helps explain salvation and the meaning of Jesus’ Hebrew name Yeshua. Even the clever advertisement on a packet of potato chips offers a lesson about how to grow in faith in God. Unlike chasing rainbows, the spiritual journey has an end. "The Name Quest" is a road map for every Christian’s spiritual journey and it points to the destination--being formed into the image of Jesus Christ.

AB  - This paper provides an introduction to sources of Indigenous law and the theoretical underpinnings of Indigenous law-based approaches to contemporary environmental management in Canada. It then explores three case studies of Indigenous peoples that have used approaches grounded in their ancestral legal traditions to confront contemporary threats to their lands and waters. These case studies highlight how the Gitanyow Hereditary Chiefs, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and the Yinka Dene Alliance have effectively drawn on and enforced their own laws in order to address challenges to the integrity of their respective territories from resource development. Finally, the paper comments on the significance of this revitalization of Indigenous legal traditions and their application to contemporary environmental problems in light of federal environmental deregulation. It posits that the current revitalization of Indigenous legal traditions should be of interest to anyone concerned with the question of environmental governance in Canada today.

AB  - Divergent values and. approaches to land and resource use and fur conservation created conflicts between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples which have remained largely hidden in historical records. This study of the compulsory trap line registration system implemented in British Columbia in 1925 examines these conflicts; the jurisdictional arid administrative issues related, to fur conservation that contributed, to the disputes; and the First Nations objections to fur management schemes that validated white appropriation of traditional lands and restricted traditional vocations and access to important sources of food.' supplies. Although First Nations people spoke persuasively about aboriginal rights and justice, their voices remained largely unheard and. unheeded. Legally disempowered and without political support, First Nation's people were marginalized, removed from lands they had occupied and used, since 'time immemorial.'

AB  - The mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestation has created momentum for change in British Columbia. Over the past 3 - 4 years, the formation of collaborative networks and other innovative partnerships, such as the First Nations Mountain Pine Beetle Initiative (FNMPBI), has identified strengths in multiagency economic development dialogue and problem solving. For the 103 First Nations communities affected by the MPB, a need exists to further transform this collaborative and synergistic atmosphere into tangible economic gains for local communities, whereby First Nations are full partners (rather than mere stakeholders) in the design and implementation of joint decision making, integrated planning, and sectoral strategy development for traditional lands. Equally important is the opportunity to acknowledge First Nations knowledge, values, and connection to nature and the surrounding land base. This commentary reflects on key discussion points that arose during the FNMPBI strategic planning sessions and the respective implications for advancing economic sustainability in MPB-affected First Nations communities in British Columbia.

AB  - Despite the interest community forestry generates, there is little published literature on the array of initiatives currently taking place across Canada. This paper presents the results of nationwide survey of community forestry initiatives on public land. The survey focused on basic characteristics such as objectives, organizational structures, and tenure types. The research revealed that there are over one hundred community forest initiatives currently taking place on public land, mainly in Ontario, Quebec, and British Columbia. Most of them are run through local government organizations. Approximately 60% operate on Crown land while the remaining 40% operate on land owned fee simple by local governments. The median land base is 4200 ha. The average age of community forests is 10 years. Key words: community forestry, community-based management, public participation, local governance, forest management organizations, Canada

TI  - The Economic Characteristics of Indigenous Property Rights: A Canadian Case Study
TY  - report
AU  - Newman, Dwight G.
SN  - ID 2800260
AB  - Legal and economic scholars have increasingly drawn attention to the impact of property rights issues on economic prosperity for Indigenous communities around the world. In the context of a constitutional provision entrenching Indigenous rights in a state whose resource industries have an international strategic significance, Canadian courts have been and are currently engaged in a process of creatively developing the parameters of various Indigenous rights, including Indigenous property rights. This Article will argue that in doing so, they have developed certain characteristics on those property rights that seemingly undermine Indigenous communities’ own opportunities to make economically beneficial choices concerning uses of their own lands for resource development. The Article will ultimately suggest that this case study raises concerns about the idea of courts focused on public law considerations being positioned so as to develop the private law characteristics of Indigenous property rights. To do so, focusing first on the Supreme Court of Canada’s landmark Aboriginal title decision in the Tsilhqot’in case, Part II of this Article engages first in the complex legal doctrinal task of trying to unpack certain aspects of just what the Court actually said on Aboriginal title and its parameters. Part III builds upon that description of the nature of the Aboriginal title property right and related writing by economic scholars to consider the economic implications of characteristics of that property right, which exhibits — relative to what would have been possible with different drafting of the judicial rules — uncertainties of scope and incentivization of attempts to create further uncertainty, simultaneous imposition of roles to multiple decision-makers on uses of the property and of surprisingly fragmented ownership characteristics, and significant restrictions on alienability of property rights. These characteristics may lead to significant economic consequences both in the context of Indigenous communities contracting with outsiders (such as with resource development proponents) and in the context of members’ own use of the land. The latter parts of Part III try to show the practical consequences for specific resource developments that might be considered by Indigenous communities, such as in the context of a mining development. Part IV, engaging with broader law and economics scholarship on the efficiency of common law adjudication processes, tries to offer some explanations of why the courts are developing these rights in ways that have these economic characteristics, in part by showing how the context in which they are operating is distinct from traditional common law contexts in which scholars have shown why courts have developed legal doctrines that fit more closely with economic efficiency. Part V tries to offer some policy responses that could help to promote the development of more economically functional property rights for Canadian Indigenous communities. Although the particular discussion is situated within Canadian legal doctrine, it will also conclude by referencing broader implications, both for American resource investors and for analogous contexts elsewhere in the world, including for the possibility that courts are not best situated to develop the shape of Indigenous property rights when their adjudicative processes are structured in certain ways.

TI  - Is the Sky the Limit? Following the Trajectory of Aboriginal Legal Rights in Resource Development
TY  - report
AU  - Newman, Dwight G.
SN  - ID 2644916
AB  - There has been a tremendous debate in recent years about the impact of a string of court decisions recognizing Aboriginal rights in Canada. What do they mean for Aboriginal prosperity? What do they mean for the natural resource sector? Are Aboriginal communities in effect gaining a veto over development? And will this apparent string of legal victories continue indefinitely?The legal developments of recent years have been welcome, in that they constitute long-overdue recognition of Aboriginal rights in the courts, and hard-won victories in cases that spanned many years. Indeed, one thing is perfectly clear, Aboriginal peoples are vital partners in development projects that affect their communities and traditional lands, and no one can deny they have a seat at the table with government and industry. But a lack of clarity about the meaning of key decisions in contexts like Aboriginal title and the duty to consult will cause uncertainty for project proponents, could create conflict with Aboriginal communities, and might in fact deny Aboriginal communities some of the economic benefits they stand to gain.This paper analyzes the recent history of Canadian court decisions on Aboriginal rights, particularly focusing on the last five years, examining some of these themes and the uncertain prospects for further gains for Aboriginal communities through litigation.

AB  - Canada is one of the world’s largest petrostates, owing to large shale oil deposits, also known as tar sands, which can be found within its borders. In recent decades, as the price of crude oil has increased dramatically, corporations and the Canadian state have worked together to open the oil deposits in Northern Canada for extraction and transportation. Despite a stated commitment to environmental sustainability by the United States and Canadian governments, both have endorsed tar sands extraction and transport. Government and corporate entities have tried to reframe tar sands as “ethical oil,” yet all steps in the process involved pose tremendous ecological, social, economic, and cultural threats to First Nations communities in Canada, landowners in the Midwest and Texas, local ecosystems, and the global climate. This practice is part of a long-standing pattern of appropriating and using public and First Nations land for economic development. We argue that tar sands production on First Nations land is a practice of resource colonialism: the theft and appropriation of land belonging to indigenous people in order to access natural resources. By branding tar sands as “ethical oil” and labeling production companies as “sustainable,” the public and private sectors bound up in the extractive economy claim to provide an essential public service while misdirecting attention away from acts of colonialism that make these resources available. In this article, we examine the ways in which corporate and state entities use the discourse of sustainability as a cover for continued resource colonialism.

TI  - The governance of forestland and resources in British Columbia : case study of Stellat'en First Nation
TY  - thesis
AU  - Lee-Johnson, Eddison Benjamin
AB  - This thesis is a case study of the Stellaquo, citing some global examples. BritishColumbia's (BC) forestland and resources governance is studied by identifying whichprocesses of devolution, combined with decentralization, are most suitable for theStellaquo. The Stellaquo identified a model ideal for their self-government, which is acombination of its pre-contact traditional and hereditary governance structure withcontemporary western government designs. The Stellaquo proposed tripartitegovernance with the federal and provincial governments, emphasizing that their self-government"must be at the center of managing consultation processes leading toextraction of resources, and possessing veto powers in determining who has accessto their resources".The thesis is written in a manuscript based format with each chapter suitable forjournal publication. Findings indicate Stellaquo's demand for a higher level ofauthority in governing forestland and resources in their territory. This proposal isbecause the Stellaquo evaluates the Indian Act model of governance as 'unsuitable',and characterized by domination and infringement approaches that colonial andpost-colonial governments used, and continue to use against Aboriginal Peoples.The research discusses issues pertaining to empowering resource users, particularlyCanada's Aboriginal Peoples or Indigenous peoples worldwide, who are utilizingproperty rights and collective rights theories for advocating equitable access andrights to territories. I utilized these theorems in support of Aboriginal Peoples' claimfor ownership to traditional territories, as jurisdictions they have resided andgoverned before colonial contact. The thesis contributes to ongoing debates overidentifying appropriate alternative resource governance policy approaches in BC.Each chapter describes the Stellaquo concerns and proposals for reforms in thegovernance of forestland and resources in BC. Finally, the thesis also complementsresearch perspectives that relate to exploring adequate measures for institutionaldevelopment of emerging First Nations governments, though I did not make thesenotions its main foci.

Two-eyed seeing is recognized by Canada’s major health research funder as a starting point for bringing together the strengths of Indigenous and Western ways of knowing. With the aim of developing a culture-based measurement tool, our team carried out an Indigenous-centred research process with our interpretation of two-eyed seeing as a guiding principle. This enabled us to engage in a decolonizing project that prioritized Indigenous methodologies and ways of knowing and knowledge alongside those of Western science. By concentrating on Indigenous governance in the research process, our project supported efforts at Indigenous cultural renewal. Two illustrations are offered, our team’s reconceptualization of Western derived understandings of data collection through Indigenous storytelling and our research grant timeframe with Indigenous knowledge gardening. This article contributes to the Indigenous research and policy literature which is lacking documentation about how Indigenous communities and research teams are benefitting from two-eyed seeing.

AB  - The Fraser River of British Columbia is among the longest montane rivers in the world. Draining a mainly wildland catchment, its hydrology is dominated by the annual snowmelt freshet and sediment yield by material recruited along the banks of the river from Pleistocene valley fills. The upper course of the river was captured from arctic drainage in late Quaternary time. Another Quaternary legacy is one of the world’s greatest salmonine fisheries. As it approaches the sea, gradient declines and the gravel load of the river is deposited, creating a wandering-braided channel zone that supports an exceptionally rich aquatic ecosystem. But it also presents a potentially escalating flood hazard to settlements along the river and to major arteries of communication. In the sand-bed deltaic reach of the river, persistent dredging for navigation has created the reverse problem of riverbed degradation and loss of sand recruitment to the delta front. Natural history and human development are intertwined in complex ways along the lower course of this river.

AB  - In 2013, the government of Canada amalgamated the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) to form the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade, and Development (DFATD), now Global Affairs Canada (GAC). Though officially amalgamation aims to ensure policy coherence and effectiveness, it also brings CIDA, which had been a relatively independent agency with considerable policy powers, directly into the foreign affairs and international trade apparatus. Recent critical scholarship demonstrates the importance of more closely examining the day-to-day labour and strategic agency of professional experts in bureaucratic settings for assessing how policy is made, and for rethinking the geographies of bureaucracy, expertise, and the capitalist state more generally. The new department's structure and operation, and how it executes its political and strategic mandates, are dependent on the reorganization of expert labour within the department, especially the integration of development experts moving from CIDA. Building from interviews and government and public sector union surveys, this paper examines amalgamation with a focus on the construction of a new “institutional culture” in DFATD/GAC and how the department reorganizes and incorporates CIDA's development expertise and experts.

AB  - 1. Habitat partitioning has been extensively studied in terrestrial plant communities. By comparison, few studies have examined habitat partitioning in riverine macrophyte communities. Riverine environments are often highly heterogeneous with respect to current speed, depth, bottom sediment fertility and other biologically important properties. Thus, the potential for habitat partitioning in riverine macrophyte communities is great. 2. The objective of this study was to investigate how, or if, macrophyte species are differentially distributed with respect to abiotic gradients in a large river in central British Columbia, Canada. 3. A survey of macrophyte biomass and associated measures of current speed, depth and sediment texture showed that coexistence occurred both with and without habitat partitioning. 4. Coexistence in the absence of habitat partitioning was depicted by Potamogeton gramineus, Potamogeton berchtoldii, Myriophyllum exalbescens, Callitriche hermaphroditica and Potamogeton pectinatus such that they had a minimum and average niche overlap (NO) of 65% and 84%, respectively, for all measured abiotic variables. Similarly, the spatial niche of E. canadensis was close to that of Ceratophyllum demersum and M. exalbescens. 5. While several taxa seemed to occupy the same spatial niche, some taxa were distinguished from one another in terms of the types of microhabitats they utilized. Mosses, for example, were often the only occupants of sites having current speeds greater than 0.6 m s–1 and substrates of bare rock. Ranunculus aquatilis was most abundant at sites having current speeds between 0.4 and 0.6 m s–1 whereas most other taxa were restricted to slower waters. Habitat partitioning across depth contours, which occurred between several taxa, was most evident between P. pectinatus and C. demersum (NO = 17%), C. hermaphroditica and C. demersum (NO = 3%), C. demersum and P. richardsonii (NO = 19%) and C. hermaphroditica and E. canadensis (NO = 29%).

AB  - Supreme Court of Canada decisions have defined a general framework for the "duty to consult" Aboriginal peoples and accomodate their concerns over natural resource development, but anticipate the details of that framework will be expanded upon in the future. Aboriginal Consultation, Environmental Assessment, and Regulatory Review in Canadaoffers a paradigm that advances that discussion. It proposes an integrated and robust planning model for natural resource planning model for natural resource extraction allowing Aboriginal peoples, industry, governments, tribunals, and the Courts to all make contributions to reconciliation in the context of sustainable development and environmental protection. Kirk Lambrecht surveys the law of actual and asserted Aboriginal rights and historical and modern Treaty rights in Canada and discusses the national and international purposes of environmental assessment and regulatory review. He appraises the fundamental principles of Supreme Court of Canada jurisprudence defining aboriginal consultation and accommodation as a constitutional imperative and uses case studies involving the National Energy Board to demonstrate how integrated process has evolved over time. Finally he offers general conclusions on the practical utility, and outstanding challenges, involving an integrated planning paradigm.

AB  - 00 This work examines the morphological and syntactic dimensions of ergativity (i.e., an intransitive subject is treated in the same manner as a transitive object and differently from the transitive subject) in Coast Tsimshian (Sm'algyax). This language is very highly morphologically ergative and the distribution of ergativity is conditioned by several different factors that are related through their coding of transitivity. Syntactically, the language is not highly ergative, but none of the cross-linguistic definitions of subject can account for the ergativity that does exist. This work examines the morphological and syntactic dimensions of ergativity (i.e., an intransitive subject is treated in the same manner as a transitive object and differently from the transitive subject) in Coast Tsimshian (Sm'algyax). This language is very highly morphologically ergative and the distribution of ergativity is conditioned by several different factors that are related through their coding of transitivity. Syntactically, the language is not highly ergative, but none of the cross-linguistic definitions of subject can account for the ergativity that does exist.

AB  - Individuals, international organizations and states are calling for the world to confront climate change. Efforts such as the Kyoto Protocol have produced intractable disputes and are deemed inadequate. This volume adopts two constructivist perspectives – norm-centred and discourse – to explore the social construction of climate change from a broad, theoretical level to particular cases. The contributors contend that climate change must be understood from the context of social settings, and that we ignore at our peril how power and knowledge structures are generated. They offer a greater understanding of why current efforts to mitigate climate change have failed and provide academics and policy makers with a new understanding of this important topic.

AB  - Recent Indigenist scholarship has situated high rates of traumatic life experiences, including sexual abuse, among Indigenous peoples of North America within the larger context of their status as colonized peoples. Sexual abuse has been linked to many negative health outcomes including mental, sexual and drug-related vulnerabilities. There is a paucity of research in Canada addressing the relationship between antecedent sexual abuse and negative health outcomes among Aboriginal people including elevated risk of HIV infection. The primary objectives of this study were to determine factors associated with sexual abuse among participants of the Cedar Project, a cohort of young Aboriginal people between the ages of 14 and 30 years who use injection and non-injection drugs in two urban centres in British Columbia, Canada; and to locate findings through a lens of historical and intergenerational trauma. We utilized post-colonial perspectives in research design, problem formulation and the interpretation of results. Multivariate modeling was used to determine the extent to which a history of sexual abuse was predictive of negative health outcomes and vulnerability to HIV infection. Of the 543 eligible participants, 48% reported ever having experienced sexual abuse; 69% of sexually abused participants were female. The median age of first sexual abuse was 6 years for both female and male participants. After adjusting for sociodemographic variables and factors of historical trauma, sexually abused participants were more likely to have ever been on the streets for more than three nights, to have ever self-harmed, to have suicide ideation, to have attempted suicide, to have a diagnosis of mental illness, to have been in the emergency department within the previous 6 months, to have had over 20 lifetime sexual partners, to have ever been paid for sex and to have ever overdosed. The prevalence and consequences of sexual abuse among Cedar Project participants are of grave concern. Sexual trauma will continue to impact individuals, families and communities until unresolved historical trauma is meaningfully addressed in client-driven, culturally safe programming.

TI  - Aboriginal forest tenure and governance in British Columbia : exploring alternatives from a Stellat'en First Nation community perspective
TY  - thesis
AU  - Weber, Sarah Elizabeth
AB  - The purpose of this research is to contribute to the identification of appropriate forest tenure and governance designs that are in congruence with Aboriginal values, interests and rights. The research is highly relevant to current societal deliberations on sustainable forest management as well as to the future of the forest sector in Canada.First Nations culture and ways of life are intimately and inextricably tied to the land. Some eighty percent of Canada’s First Nations communities are situated in productive forest regions (NAFA 2003). Even so, First Nations have been largely excluded from forest development and planning activities. Furthermore, the provincial policy emphasis on industrial timber production may not be consistent with Aboriginal forest values. This community-based research takes a participatory approach to forest policy analysis. The work is conducted in partnership with the Stellat’en First Nation and Carrier Sekani Tribal Council in central British Columbia. Stellat’en criteria for forest tenure and governance are identified in a series of workshops and interviews. These criteria are then applied in the analysis of four alternative models: the Community Ecosystem Trust, the Gitanyow joint land use planning model, BC Community Forest Agreements and Aboriginal reservations in the United States.The results indicated that Stellat’en have three main goals regarding forest tenure and governance: protect the traditional territory for future generations, protect Stellat’en culture and support Stellat’en economic self-determination. Implementation of the Stellat’en vision calls for a greater emphasis on ecological and cultural values in forest management, devolution of decision making authority to First Nations, reallocation of harvesting rights and redistribution of wealth generated by forest activities. The Stellat’en perspective emphasizes co-existence and stewardship.Evaluation of the four alternative models provided useful insights for progressive tenure and governance design. All four models had positive aspects to contribute, as well as shortcomings. The models are not mutually exclusive. Since each model addresses different management and institutional functions, they could be combined into a new system for the future.

AB  - Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHC) are common soil contaminants. A number of methods have been used to extract PHCs from soil prior to quantification by gas chromatography (GC). These methods often require long extraction times and expensive, specialized equipment. A shaking method was assessed for simple, rapid removal of PHCs from contaminated soils. Shaking spiked and aged contaminated soils for 4 h with acetone:hexane (1:1) at a soil:solvent ratio of 1:30 (g:mL) recovered 74 to 108% of PHC, compared with a Soxhlet extraction, yielding a good correlation (4 h = −93.7 + 0.99 Soxhlet r = 0.99, P < 0.001). Preliminary results show that this 4-h procedure has potential for the quick, inexpensive extraction of PHCs from contaminated soils. Key words: Petroleum hydrocarbons, soil analysis, extraction method, gas chromatography, Soxhlet extraction

TI  - Stratigraphy, maturation and source rock potential of cretaceous strata in the Chilcotin-Nechako region of British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Hunt, Julie A.
AB  - The Chilcotin-Nechako region lies within the Intermontane Belt of British Columbia on the western edge of Stikinia and includes the Tyaughton Basin. Exposed within the region are Early Albian to Cenomanian sediments of the Skeena, Taylor Creek, Jackass Mountain and Battlement Ridge groups plus unnamed sediments of similar age and lithology. These sediments were deposited in one large, initially marine, basin (Nazko Basin) and are separated from older sediments by a major hiatus (Barremian to Aptian in the south and Berriasian to Valanginian in the north). Marine conditions persisted in the northern Chilcotin-Nechako region until at least Cenomanian time, and until the Maastrichtian in the central Chilcotin-Nechako region. In southern Chilcotin-Nechako region, marine conditions ceased in mid Albian time with the deposition of the Silverquick formation. Latest Albian - Cenomanian time marks the transition from a dominantly sedimentary to volcanic province. Volcanism was widespread throughout the Chilcotin-Nechako region until at least the Santonian (Kasalka and upper Kingsvale groups, Powell Creek formation, unnamed volcanics and possibly the Brian Boni Formation). In Central Chilcotin-Nechako region volcanism was succeeded by marine sedimentation in the Santonian which continued until Maastrichtian time, indicating marine conditions persisted on the mainland of British Columbia well beyond the previously documented Albian limit. Sedimentsin the Nazko Basin were sourced from the Omineca Belt and the Cache Creek Terrane to the east and the Insular Terrane to the west. In the southern region detritus was also provided by the Bridge River Terrane.New data from this study indicate mid to Late Cretaceous sediments within the Chilcotin-Nechako region are zeolite facies. This low grade of metamorphism isprobably due to comparatively low heat flow in the Chilcotin-Nechako region. When compared to equivalent strata exposed to the north, sediments within the Nazko Basin have markedly lower maturation values even though they have experienced the same amount of burial. Sediments with zeolite grade metamorphism have the potential to lie within the oil window and thus may contain significant hydrocarbon reserves. However, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and TOC analyses of outcrop and well samples indicate the overall hydrocarbon potential of the Chilcotin-Nechako region is low.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Ma, Kathy
AU  - Krawchuk, Meg
AB  - Relationships between tree growth and climate can be found using dendroclimatology, and are important as a basis for understanding regional limiting factors of growth and projecting how forests might be altered by climate change. This study aims to determine factors limiting growth of coniferous trees in the Nechako region of sub-boreal Central-Interior British Columbia by studying tree growth-climate relationships at the Carrot Lake Experimental Fire Study area. Trees cores were collected from the study area in 2012 then processed and analyzed in 2014. Ringcounting of cores from Lodgepole Pine and White Spruce trees indicated samples had ages of 127-136 years. Tree ring chronologies were standardized, verified by cross-dating, and pre-whitened for dendroclimatology analysis. A simple linear regression comparison of ring widths against summer temperature and precipitation data from nearby weather stations showed there was a statistically significant, positive correlation between annual ring growth and precipitation in the month of May (standardized R2 = 0.06128, pre-whitened R2 = 0.05635; n = 9). This indicates a growth-precipitation relationship during the beginning of the growing season, where more rain results in greater growth. Due to the small, localized sample size used in this study these findings may only represent the mesoclimate of the Carrot Lake Experimental Fire study site. Nevertheless, this study may be the basis for future research that can provide better insight into the climate historyfor the region, as well as projections of climate change impacts on the forests of British Columbia

TI  - Come hell and high water : the relocation of the Cheslatta First Nation
TY  - thesis
AU  - Katherine Buhler
AB  - This thesis explores the history of the Cheslatta T'en First Nation of Grassy Plains British Columbia in the context of their forced relocation in 1952. The Cheslatta people were once self-reliant and prosperous. They farmed, trapped, hunted and fished in the same territory they had occupied for centuries. The Cheslatta people were a close-knit community who relied only on each other in times of need. All of that changed in April of 1952 when the Department of Indian Affairs informed the people they would have to leave immediately, as their land was about to flood. Shocked and heartbroken, the people packed up the few belongings they could carry and left for Grassy Plains where they lived in tents, shacks and abandoned buildings until they could find or build new homes. Since that time the close-knit community has fallen victim to bitterness and hostility, drug and alcohol abuse, unemployment and violence. Through band members' oral accounts, newspapers, legal documents and secondary sources, the history of the Cheslatta people emerges as one of struggle since 1952. Because the people did not relocate on their own terms, and because they did not have time to adapt to the loss of their land, the Cheslatta people were unable to recreate or redefine their community in a way they could all accept. Oral accounts show an abrupt change in the ways in which band members related to one another and their surroundings. Legal testimony shows that the governments of the day treated band members unfairly and denied them recourse. Unemployment, substance abuse and a distinct lack of communication between elders and young people compounded their frustration and heartbrea, further contributing to the community's breakdown.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Beck, Lindsay Nicole
AB  - Guided by decolonizing methodologies and ecosystem approaches to health, this thesis explores Saik'uz First Nation (SFN) youth perspectives about the connections between land, health and well-being. The project engaged a small group of youth (ages 14-27) in a modified Photovoice project, embedded within a qualitative study. Their experience and photos were discussed through the Indigenous method of sharing circles, guided by two Elders, followed by semi-structured interviews. The research process was developed with a community research advisor designated by the Chief and Council. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged that represented how these SFN youth saw the land, health and well-being as connected and relational. Additionally, the youth described two main drivers of change that were impacting these relationships. The youth and Elders' insights have provided fertile ground for ideas about how to progress ecohealth and First Nations health through the Northern BC landscape.

Lives are shattered irrevocably. A young man drives off into the night, leaving a girl injured, perhaps fatally so. From that cliffhanger opening, Leipciger takes readers back and forward in time to tell the haunting story of one family's unraveling in rural logging country where the land is still the economic backbone. Like the novels of Annie Proulx, this debut is rooted in richly detailed nature writing and sharply focused on small town mores and regional culture.Marrying the propulsive story of a father and son who, in the wake of catastrophe, must confront their private demons to reach for redemption with an evocative meditation on our environmental legacy, THE MOUNTAIN CAN WAIT introduces Leipciger as an exciting new talent.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Blaschek, Daniel
AB  - Considering the low completion rates at Fraser Valley Distance Education School, which are as low as 40 percent in secondary courses, there needs to be an attempt to engage students in order to promote their understanding of material and motivate them to complete courses. This is done through considering what students need to be engaged, and how to promote this engagement online. Making sure that students understand what a school’s online program consists of is important, as transparency of information is essential with all the confusing and conflicting terms in Distributed Learning. The term online education promotes the idea that students will receive a lesser education than those in the face-to-face program, meaning they will complete more work but understand less information because they are not in a group setting. There needs to be a balance between using online programs that are free and already in place (Twitter, Wikis, Blogs), and using a school wide Learning Management systems (LMS) that students do not have experience with. Those students who were asked to use online programs in which they were not familiar reported that taking the time to understand the process took time away from their learning, and thus hindered their engagement. Students require clear and detailed feedback in a timely manner, combined with personal communication with their teacher. Students must get individual attention in the form of phone calls, emails, and one on one virtual lessons if engagement is going to be promoted. Those students who were surveyed after getting this individualized attention said they felt the teacher cared for them, and they wanted to work for someone who took this time to show student success was of importance. This paper examines the need for a student centred approach to online education, combined with the ease of access required in online communication systems.

SN  - 11817534
AB  - Canadian environmental law has long been rooted in the legislature delegating decision-making responsibility to some part of the executive -- the Cabinet, a minister, some line department or tribunal. This delegation may take the form of broad discretion to set environmental policy. The courts are one form of control over such delegated powers. However, the Supreme Court has increasingly emphasized the need for judges to defer to executive decision-makers. This paper examines how the courts have used their powers of review to see if they are able to perform an effective monitoring role given the extent of delegation in environmental law and this increased emphasis on deference. It provides an initial empirical examination of how the Federal Court reviewed government decisions both generally and in the environmental area. It focuses on two years, one before Dunsmuir and one after, to see how willing the courts were to affirm government decisions, whether the form of review was correlated with the court affirming a decision, and whether there are indications of a connection between the substance of the decision and the likelihood of affirmation. It argues that there is evidence that the courts have tended to affirm government action and given the structure of environmental and administrative law, will likely continue to do so.

AB  - Although it is well established that background geochemical patterns in stream sediments generally depend on drainage basin geology, little is known of the effects of watershed disturbance on such patterns. Here we report on the effects of forestry activities on sediment geochemistry on the Interior Plateau of British Columbia. Stream sediment samples were collected from six small streams in 1996, before logging, and in 1997 after clear-cut logging. Samples were sieved and the −212 μm fraction analysed by multi-element ICP after both strong acid and total decomposition procedures. Field and analytical duplicates, and samples from unlogged control sites were used to estimate variations not associated with logging activities. Results show that prior to logging each stream had a distinct multi-element geochemical signature related to drainage basin geology. There was no overall effect of logging on these signatures within or downstream of the cut-blocks — probably because unlogged buffer zones along the stream channels prevented the development of new sediment sources. Logging roads did, however, cause local changes of sediment geochemistry in two ways. (1) Abrasion of zinc from galvanized culverts results in zinc anomalies, with concentrations &gt; 200 ppm. These anomalies can extend several hundred metres downstream and persist for at least five years after installation of culverts. (2) Construction of stream crossings and roadside ditches create new sources of sediment supply to the streams. Although of local origin, the newly exposed and eroding surficial deposits contain more fine-grained material and have multi-element geochemical signatures that differ significantly from those of the mature fluvial sediments found in the stream channel before logging. Input of the new material results in geochemical anomalies that can extend several hundred metres downstream from the source. In this study Co, Mg and Ni were found to have the largest concentration differences between sediment sources and sediments, and hence to give the longest anomalous dispersion trains. The effects of logging roads on sediment geochemistry thus relate to creation of new sources of local sediment as well as to introduction of exotic materials into the stream. No geochemical response could be attributed to the clear-cut forest block. Such changes might develop eventually if soil erosion increased or if changes to the groundwater regime modified input of dissolved elements to the stream channel.

TI  - Geology of the Topley intrusives in the Endako area British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Bright, Edward Gordon
AB  - Granitic rocks of the Topley intrusives underlying 100square miles, centered around Endako, north central BritishColumbia, form part of a composite body which lies in a northwesttrending belt of granitic plutons extending from Babine Lake toQuesnel, a distance of 180 miles.Rocks of the Topley complex in the Endako area have intrudedvolcanic rocks of the Takla Group (Upper Triassic to Jurassic) andare unconformably overlain by flat-lying Tertiary volcanic flows.These intrusions are probably of Lower Jurassic to Lower Cretaceousage. The granitic rocks, ranging from diorite to alaskite form sixlarge separately emplaced and sharply bounded intrusive bodies.The development of the Topley complex can be divided chronologically,from oldest to youngest, into five major stages: (I) the Simon Bay(diorite) complex; (II) the Endako quartz monzonite which is the hostrock of the Endako molybdenum deposit, and the Franco is granite;(III) the Glennanan complex; (IV) the Casey quartz monzonite-alaskite;and (V) the Stellako quartz monzonite. The Glennanan complex, which is the best exposed and mostintensely studied intrusive, consists of two large asymmetricallyzoned bodies and a small stock of porphyritic quartz monzonite. Thelarger zoned body near the town of Endako has: (1) a western zoneof porphyritic granite; (2) an intermediate zone of porphyritic quartzmonzonite; and (3) an eastern zone of porphyritic granodiorite.A granodiorite zone is absent in the asymmetrically zoned NithiMountain intrusive body. All internal contact are gradational andall rock zones contain large rectangular perthite megacrysts whichenclose oriented crystals of plagioclase and other minerals. Thedevelopment of the rock zones can be accounted for by differentiationof a hornblende-biotite granodiorite magma at depth and successiveintrusion of first granite, then quartz monzonite and finally granodiorite.Topley stages II to V represent a continuous period of epizonalintrusion following the emplacement of the more deep seated(mesozonal?) Simon Bay complex. Northwesterly and northeasterlytrending fracture zones controlled the structural evolution of theTopley complex in the map area.

AB  - This volume addresses a wide range of topics related to Aboriginal resource use, ranging from the pre-contact period to the present. The papers were originally presented at a conference held in 1988 at the University of Winnipeg. Co-editor Kerry Abel has written an introduction that outlines the main themes of the book. She points out that it is difficult to know what the enshrinement of Aboriginal rights in the Canadian Constitution means without knowing exactly what constituted the Aboriginal interest in the land past and present. She also summarizes some of the developments in the rapidly evolving concept of Aboriginal rights.

AB  - River regulation imposes primary changes on flow and sediment transfer, the principal factors governing the alluvial channel regime. In this study, the effect of flow regulation is isolated from sediment delivery. Peace River (Q̄ = 1080m3s−1, increasing to 2110m3s−1 downstream) was regulated in 1967 for hydropower. The gravel-bed reach immediately downstream from the dam has become stable. Gravel accumulates at major tributary junctions, so the river profile is becoming stepped. Further downstream, the river has a sand bed. It can still transport sand, so morphological changes along the channel include both aggradation and channel narrowing by lateral accretation. In the gravel-bed Kemano River (Q̄ = 150m3s−1), the addition of water by diversion from another river caused degradation when additional bed material was entrained below the inflow point. However, the effect became evident only after many years, when a competent flood occurred. The short-term response was channel widening. The time-scale for the response depends on the size of the river and the nature and severity of regulation. In both rivers, significant adjustment will require centuries and will intimately involve the riparian forest.

AB  - Predation of rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) on migrant sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) fry in experimental streams was higher on fry at an earlier development stage, in moonlight by contrast to cloudy night light intensities, at lesser turbidities, and at lower stream velocities. At dusk light intensities, from.05 to.30 ft-c, mortality from predation was inversely related to light intensity. The longer the period of exposure of fry to naturally declining light intensities prior to downstream movement, the lower was the loss to predators. Exposure of predators to high light intensities prior to the downstream movement of fry resulted in decreased fry mortality. Fry that had survived exposure to predators in an experimental stream 1 and 2 days previous were less vulnerable to predation than "naive" fry. Successive exposures further decreased the loss to predation. Fry enumerated at a counting fence suffered less predation than fry not enumerated. Experienced fry moved downstream more rapidly than naive..., La prédation de la truite arc-en-ciel (Salmo gairdneri) sur des alevins migrateurs de saumon nerka (Oncorhynchus nerka) dans des cours d’eau expérimentaux est plus élevée sur des alevins à un stade moins avancé de leur développement, au cours de nuits éclairées par la lune par opposition à des intensités lumineuses de nuits nuageuses, à des turbidités plus faibles et dans des courants plus lents. A des intensités lumineuses de crépuscule,.05 à.30 pi-c, les mortalités dues à la prédation sont inversement proportionnelles à l’intensité lumineuse. Plus grande est la durée d’exposition des alevins à des intensités lumineuses décroissant naturellement, avant la migration d’avalaison, plus faible est la perte par prédation. L’exposition des prédateurs à de fortes intensités lumineuses avant la descente des alevins résulte en une diminution de mortalité des alevins. Les alevins qui ont survécu à une «expérience» d’exposition aux prédateurs dans un cours d’eau expérimental 1 ou 2 jours avant sont moins vulnérable...

AB  - Exposure to gas supersaturation can have a significant impact on aquatic animals held in culture systems, resulting in gas bubble trauma (GBT) due to the formation of gas bubbles in the tissues and vascular system. Typically, most research on gas supersaturation has been conducted on salmonid species which were exposed to acutely lethal levels. The chronic effects of sublethal gas supersaturation levels that may be present in many hatcheries are not well identified due to the low levels of gas supersaturation involved, a delay of 1–2 months before the start of mortality, a lack of typical clinical signs of gas bubble trauma and significant seasonal variation in the gas levels of many surface waters. Gas bubble trauma can be produced by influent water that is supersaturated or by production of gas supersaturation within the hatchery. Prevention of gas bubble trauma in hatcheries will require degassing of influent water and some process waters, design of aquatic systems to prevent production of gas supersaturation, and proper operation of the water system and water quality maintenance processes.

AB  - The effect of turbidity on the predator avoidance behaviour of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was determined in controlled laboratory experiments. Bird and fish models were used to simulate predator risk. In the absence of risk, juvenile chinook were distributed randomly within an experimental arena in turbid conditions (≈23 NTU), but in clear conditions (<1 NTU) they associated with the bottom. When introduced to bird and fish predator models, the chinook altered their distribution and occupied deeper parts of the arena regardless of turbidity level. However, their responses in turbid conditions were less marked and of shorter duration. Turbidity apparently reduced the perceived risk of predation in juvenile chinook., Les effets de la turbidité sur le comportement d'évitement des prédateurs par les juvéniles de saumon quinnat (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) ont été déterminés dans le cadre d'expériences vérifiées en laboratoire. Les modèles d'oiseaux et de poissons ont été utilisés pour simuler le risque auprès du prédateur. En l'absence de risque, les juvéniles de quinnat étaient distribués de façon aléatoire à l'intérieur d'une enceinte expérimentale, dans des conditions de turbidité (≈23 UTN), mais dans des conditions de limpidité (<1 UTN) ils se regroupaient au fond. Quand on les a mis en présence de représentations d'oiseaux et de poissons prédateurs, la distribution des quinnats a été modifiée, ceux-ci occupant les endroits les plus profonds de l'enceinte, peu importe le niveau de turbidité. Toutefois, leur réponse dans des conditions de turbidité étaient moins marquée et de plus courte durée. La turbidité semblait réduire le risque perçu de prédation chez les juvéniles de quinnat.

TI  - Tectonic and stratigraphic relations between the Coast Plutonic Complex and Intermontane Belt, west-central Whitesail Lake map area, British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Heyden, Peter van der
AB  - The upper Tsaytis River area, about 150 km² in extent, straddles the Coast Plutonic Complex-Intermontane Belt boundary about 580 km northwest of Vancouver, British Columbia. The boundary, here, is the Sandifer Lake Fault Zone, a highly disrupted, northeastward directed, imbricated thrust complex of middle to Late Cretaceous age.Rocks of the Coast Plutonic Complex occur in imbricate sheets above a frontal thrust. In this gently dipping, homoclinal sequence of tectonic sheets, amphibolites, amphibolite-grade granitoid gneisses, migmatites and metacarbonates of the Central Gneiss Complex tectonically overlie greenschist facies, metavolcanic and metaplutonic schists and mylonites of the Gamsby Group. The Central Gneiss Complex and the Gamsby Group appear to be stratigraphically equivalent units, metamorphosed to different grade and structurally juxtaposed in the thrust complex. Major and trace element chemistry of metavolcanic rocks in the Gamsby Group indicates that protoliths were tholeiitic and calc-alkaline basalt-andesite and calc-alkaline dacite-rhyolite which originated in a mature island arc setting. A minimum, Upper Triassic protolith age for the Gamsby Group is provided by a 210 Ma, near concordant U/Pb zircon date for metarhyolite, and a 230±39 Ma Rb/Sr whole rock isochron date. Mylonitic granite in the Gamsby Group gives a 160±24 Ma Rb/Sr whole rock isochron date, and amphibole from a related, deformed injection agmatite gives a 145±5 Ma K-Ar date. Hornblende from a dyke with chilled margins, which intrudes the Gamsby Group, gives a 66±2 Ma K-Ar date, indicating that the metamorphic complex was cold and close to the surface before the end of the Cretaceous. These results and geology reported for the Prince Rupert area (Crawford and Hollister 1982, and unpublished GSC and UBC zircon data) indicate that at this latitude in the Coast Plutonic Complex, regional metamorphism, polyphase ductile deformation, and intrusion of granitoid material occured in a two-sided, Jurassic and Cretaceous orogenic welt. The orogen was superimposed on the pre-Upper Triassic island arc in the western edge of Stikinia, as a consequence of initial suturing of Stikinia with the allochtonous Wrangellia-Alexander terrane at an unknown distance to the southwest of the thesis area. A Lower Cretaceous volcanic-plutonic complex forms the eastern and lowest thrust sheet of the Coast Plutonic Complex. The volcanic rocks may be correlative with the Gambier Group of the southern Coast Plutonic Complex, and were perhaps deposited unconformably on the uplifted Jurassic orogen. They were invaded and hornfelsed by Cretaceous granitic stocks before being thrust northeastward over strata of the Intermontane Belt.Middle-Upper Cretaceous shortening and associated brittle shearing along the Sandifer Lake Fault Zone occured in a high heat flow, back-arc setting. The Central Gneiss Complex, Gamsby Group, and Gambier Group(?) were imbricated and thrust over Intermontane Belt rocks of the Telkwa Formation. The imbricate tectonic front was disrupted, successively, by strike-slip and dip-slip faults in Late Cretaceous to early Cenozoic time. The latest movement on high angle faults postdates Eocene intrusions, nearby, and Eocene strata, Regionally, but predates Miocene Plateau basalts (Woodsworth 1979, 1980).Several dated, cross-cutting intrusive stocks in the Whitesail Lake map area (Woodsworth 1980), indicate that the Sandifer Lake Fault Zone, juxtaposing the Coast Plutonic Complex and Intermontane Belt, had definitely ceased movement by Eocene time and quite possibly by Late Cretaceous time.

TI  - Moose habitat selection in relation to forest cutting practices in northcentral British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Schwab, Francis Edward
AB  - This thesis is primarily directed at documenting moose (Alces alces andersonii) habitat selection in an area containing a diversity of ages and styles of logging. The habitat occupation patterns of radio collared moose were recorded during the period April 1980 to May 1983 in an area centred 50 km northeast of Prince George B.C. The habitat associations of the radio collared moose were tested against the following alternate hypotheses. For the winter period: (1) Moose are not randomly distributed but select habitats with greater amounts of forage except when snow depth exceeds 90 cm. If snow depth exceeds 90 cm, then moose will select habitats with greater forest cover. (2) Moose are not randomly distributed but select the habitat with the greatest forest cover as protection from cold stress when air temperatures are lower than -20°C. For the summer (nonwinter) period: (1) Moose are not randomly distributed but select habitats with greater amounts of forage. (2) Moose are not randomly distributed but will select habitats with greater forest cover when air temperatures exceed 20°C.Moose followed a general annual pattern that varied according to the conditions prevalent during individual seasons. In spring, moose were found in open habitats. The spring to summer change of season saw moose move into habitat characterized by high forest cover values. In fall, moose were again associated with habitats with closed forest canopies. Early winter produced a dramatic shift of moose locations into open habitats. In midwinter and late winter, moose retreated to habitats with heavy forest cover.Moose were usually nonrandomly distributed with respect to habitat type. However, the alternate hypotheses generally failed to account for the departures from randomness. In spring, habitat associations suggested selection for habitats with greater forage biomass. However, the correlations between moose habitat associations and available forage biomass were not consistently high and one of four spring periods produced a negative correlation between available forage and habitat associations. In summer, moose habitat associations could be explained by moose avoiding heat stress. Fall habitat associations were never explicable by the tested alternate hypotheses. In early winter, habitat associations once again suggested that moose were selecting habitat which produced plentiful forage. During one early winter, however, there was a higher correlation between moose habitat associations and forest cover than between habitat associations and available forage. In one midwinter season moose habitat associations were consistent with the hypothesis that moose seek habitat with heavy forest cover when snow depths exceed 90 cm, but avoidance of cold stress would have produced the same pattern of habitat association. Neither of the tested alternate hypotheses could explain moose habitat associations in the other midwinter season, nor in two late winter seasons.Comparisons of calculated equivalent black body temperatures (T[sub e]) to known upper critical limits confirmed that heat stress is an important factor for moose in summer. Further, T[sub e] estimates revealed that heat stress and not cold, was affecting moose in winter and that the observed pattern of winter habitat associations could be explained by moose avoiding heat stress.There are hypotheses which were not explicitly tested which could explain moose habitat associations unexplained by the alternate hypotheses: moose may not select habitat on the basis of prevailing conditions, but rather (1) may be exhibiting patterns learned from their dams. (2) Moose avoidance of open areas in fall could be caused by their avoidance of human activity. Finally, (3) the large proportion of moose locations in heavy forest covers in all seasons could be a predator avoidance strategy.The hypothesis that moose require forest cover to protect them from heat stress was much more successful at predicting moose habitat associations than was the hypothesis that moose should seek habitat producing large amounts of forage conditional upon snow depth being less than 90 cm. In fact, forage production conditional upon snow depth could not unequivocally explain the pattern of moose habitat association in any season. However, this result should be interpreted as supporting the need for mature trees on moose range, to avoid heat stress, and not to minimize concern for moose forage requirements. In any season, good moose range will contain both forage and mature trees.On the study area, the heterogenous intermediate utilization logging should be conserved as moose habitat, especially where it occurs on moose winter range. Moose habitat can be conserved or improved with 4 ha clearcuts. Where logging economics demand large clearcuts, cover blocks and travel corridors should be provided to conserve moose habitat.

TI  - Reactions to contact and colonization : an interpretation of religious and social change among Indians of British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Rumley, Hilary Eileen
AB  - This thesis examines the development of the reactions of Indians of British Columbia to contact and colonization. It is maintained that religious and social changes which have occurred among Indians of British Columbia since contact with the White man can best be understood when interpreted as phases in a continuous process of development. This process of change began with the emergence of prophet movements at approximately the same time as the White man's presence was beginning to be felt in the area. These prophet movements exhibited characteristics typical of messianic movements elsewhere. Native prophets predicted the arrival of White men, their power and possessions. When missionaries arrived in the area they were generally accorded an enthusiastic reception. The appeal of missionary Christianity is analysed with reference to the millenial ambience established in the earlier prophet movements and to the messages and media communicated by the missionaries. For many Indians, it is argued, conversion to Christianity was equivalent to participating in a millenarian activity. An examination of typical converts and Christian communities established by various missionaries reveals the attempt by many Indians to adopt White culture and realize the expectations apparent in the prophet movements. Disillusionment with missionary Christianity was the result of the widening colonial experience. Although desiring equality with the White man, Indians remained politically, economically and socially subordinate. Conversion to Christianity had not succeeded in satisfying Indian needs and expectations. Indians began asserting a desire for independent control of their own affairs, a desire found among colonial peoples in other parts of the world. But the nature of the colonial situation in Canada has left the Indians a minority group with no effective political power, and thus assertions of Indian nationalism in British Columbia have been directed into such activities as political pressure groups, the revival of Indian spirit dancing and other ceremonials.

AB  - This paper reviews the current state of knowledge about the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in southern and central British Columbia. Reconstructions of the ice sheet and the styles of ice expansion and déglaciation are based on extensive and varied glacigenic sediments and landforms that date from Late Wisconsinan (Fraser) Glaciation. Late-glacial lakes and sea level changes are also described and related to isostatic and eustatic effects. The timing of ice expansion and recession during Fraser Glaciation was markedly asymmetric: ice build-up commenced about 29 000 years BP, culminated between 14 500 and 14 000 years BP1 and déglaciation was largely completed by 11 500 years BP. Most of this interval appears to have been dominated by montane glaciation, which produced striking erosional landforms. A Cordilleran Ice Sheet existed from only about 19 000 to 13 500 years BP. An older glaciation, probably of Early Wisconsinan age, has been recognized from widespread exposures of drift that underlies Middle Wisconsinan non-glacial sediments. Pre-Wisconsinan drift is present near Vancouver. Drifts of late Tertiary to Middle Pleistocene age have been dated by association with volcanic sequences in the southern Coast Mountains and the central Interior, and by paleomagnetic studies in the southern Interior., On résume ici l'état des connaissances sur l'Inlandsis de la Cordillère du sud et du centre de la Colombie-Britannique. Les reconstitutions de l'inlandsis et les modes d'englaciation et de déglaciation sont fondés sur les formes et les sédiments glaciaires qui datent de la glaciation du Wisconsinien supérieur (Fraser). On décrit également les lacs tardiglaciaires et les changements du niveau marin en relation avec les conséquences sur les niveaux isostatique et eustatique. Les rythmes de la progression et du retrait glaciaire ont été tout à fait différents; la giaciation a commencé vers 29 000 BP, a connu son optimum entre 14 500 et 14 000 BP et la déglaciation était à toutes fins utiles terminée dès 11 500 BP. La plus grande partie de cette époque a été dominée par une glaciation de type alpin, qui a engendré des formes d'érosion remarquables. L'Inlandsis de la Cordillère n'a existé que de 19 000 à 13 500 BP. On a identifié une glaciation plus ancienne, probablement du Wisconsinien inférieur, à partir des affleurements répandus de dépôts glaciaires sous-jacents aux sédiments non glaciaires du Wisconsinien moyen. On a observé des dépôts glaciaires pré-wisconsiniens près de Vancouver. Les dépôts glaciaires datant du Tertiaire supérieur au Pleistocene moyen ont été datés par association aux séquences volcaniques du sud des montagnes Côtières et du centre de l'Intérieur et grâce à des études de paléomagnétisme menées dans le sud du système de l'Intérieur., Dieser Artikel gibt einen uberblick ûber den gegenwartigen Forschungsstand zur Kordilleren-Eisdecke im Sùden und im Zentrum von British Columbia. Die Rekonstruktionen der Eisdecke und der Art und Weise der Eisausdehnung und Enteisung stùtzen sich auf extensive und mannigfache glazigene Sedimente und Landformen, die aus der Spât-Wisconsin- (Fraser) Vereisung stammen. Spàtglaziale Seen und Meeresniveauwechsel werden auch beschrieben und in Beziehung zu isostatischen und eustatischen Auswirkungen gesetzt. Der zeitliche Ablauf der Eisausdehnung und des Eisrùckzugs wàhrend der Fraser-Vereisung war deutlich asymmetrisch : die Vereisung begann um etwa 29 000 Jahre v.u.Z., erreichte ihren Hôchststand zwischen 14 500 und 14 000 Jahren v.u.Z. und die Enteisung war weitgehend vollendet um 11 500 Jahre v.u.Z. Der grôfîte Tail dieses Zeitraums scheint von einer alpinen Vereisung beherrscht gewesen zu sein, welche eindrucksvolle Erosions-Landformen hervorbrachte.

AB  - A means of estimating tree diameter at breast height from stump measurements has many applications. In this paper, metric equations are derived for estimating diameters at breast height from measured stump heights for all commercial tree species in British Columbia by age class and biogeoclimatic zones. The model found best was the same one as used by Alemdag and Honer (1977) for eleven tree species from eastern and central Canada. This prediction system can be incorporated into any local volume equation to derive a tree volume prediction model based on stump diameter and stump height.

AB  - There have been profound declines in marine survival rates of steelhead trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), coho salmon (O. kisutch), chinook salmon (O. tschawytscha), and Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) since the mid-1980s, and these declines have been particularly acute in sunny regions. We suggest that the problem may originate in freshwater with radiation (e.g., UV-B) damage to metabolic machinery that is expressed during stressful periods of smolting and ocean entry and that progressively worse damage may soon appear as reduction in freshwater survivals as well. This hypothesis can be tested quickly by management agencies by comparing survival rates of hatchery-reared fish with and without radiation protection during rearing., Nous observons depuis le milieu des années 80 des baisses graves du taux de survie en mer du saumon arc-en-ciel (Oncorhynchus mykiss), du coho (O. kisutch), du quinnat (O. tschawytscha) et du saumon atlantique (Salmo salar). Ces baisses sont particulièrement marquées dans les régions ensoleillées. Nous pensons que le problème trouve son origine en eau douce, le rayonnement (p. ex. les UV-B) causant des dommages métaboliques qui s'expriment pendant les périodes de stress que sont la smoltification et l'entrée en mer, et que des dommages de plus en plus graves pourraient se manifester bientôt sous la forme d'une réduction de la survie en eau douce également. Cette hypothèse peut être vérifiée rapidement par les organismes de gestion : il suffirait de comparer les taux de survie de poissons d'élevage qui seraient protégés ou non du rayonnement pendant le grossissement.[Traduit par la Rédaction]

AB  - Foresters have traditionally managed forests with silvicultural systems that prescribe stand homogeneity for optimized tree growth. The primacy of timber as the dominant objective is giving way to broader objectives such as sustaining the function and dynamics of ecosystems, maintaining ecosystem diversity and resilience or protecting sensitive species, while providing for a variety of ecosystem services of value to humanity. Protection and production of more diverse forest values demands consideration of the fine-scale variability found within forest stands and an understanding of the spatial and temporal response of forest ecosystems to manipulation. Studies of gap dynamics have contributed significantly to our understanding of the role of small-scale disturbance in forest ecosystems, but have been used little by foresters for predicting ecosystem response to partial cutting. We review the gap dynamics literature paying special attention to papers that use gap size or position as predictive variables for responses indicative of silvicultural success or maintenance of ecosystem function. Like canopy gaps created by natural tree death or windthrow, gaps are also generated by silvicultural systems which remove dominant trees. Results from the Date Creek silvicultural systems study in northwestern British Columbia presented here demonstrate the utility of a gap-based approach for understanding ecosystem responses to tree cutting. We propose a gap-based approach for study response to silvicultural manipulation that: (1) aids development of cutting prescriptions that maintain functional mature or old-growth conditions; (2) refines and extends our understanding of how biological structures, organisms and ecosystem processes are affected by fine-scale variation within stands; and (3) leads to development of novel silvicultural systems that meet timber production objectives, without compromising ecosystem management principles.

AB  - British Columbia, the westernmost province of Canada, encompasses about 366,255 square miles of highly varied landscape that in 1775, the beginning of the historic period in this area, supported an aboriginal population conservatively estimated at only 74,400 people (Borden 1954:189). The major population centers were along the coast and on the lower reaches of the major river systems (the Fraser, Bella Coola, Nass, Skeena, and Stikine), which flow westward through the coastal mountain ranges from the interior plateaux. These rivers connect to the inside passage, a coastal network of protected channels and fjords that runs from Alaska south through British Columbia to Puget Sound in Washington, and together they formed the main routes of interregional communication and commerce. Both cultural complexity and population density were highest on the coast and lowest in the further reaches of the interior with various intervening intergradations (Kroeber 1939).

AB  - Overall abundance—catch plus escapement—of adult Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in the Fraser River basin (about one quarter of the area of British Columbia [BC]) has decreased sharply for sockeye (O. nerka), pink (O. gorbuscha), chum (O. keta), chinook (O. tshawytscha), and coho (O. kisutch) salmon between estimated levels near the turn of the century and those of recent decades. The extent of decline ranges from a low of about twofold for chum salmon to a high of nearly eightfold for coho salmon. Nevertheless, the Fraser River still remains the world’s greatest single river producer of Pacific salmon. Trend analyses for escapements over recent decades show statistically significant increases for all Pacific salmon escapements combined and for pink, chum, chinook, and sockeye individually. Sub-basins of the Fraser watershed support distinctive mixes of the five eastern Pacific salmon species; extent, causes, and management implications of these regional differences in species abundance are explored. Parts of the remaining three quarters of BC also support sizable stocks of Pacific salmon. The largest other producer is the Skeena River system. Small to moderate stocks occur in the Okanagan River (Columbia drainage), a number of Vancouver Island and Queen Charlotte Island rivers, various coastal drainages of the south-central mainland, the Nass and Stikine river systems, as well as in other transboundary coastal rivers (Alaska panhandle), and in tributaries of the Yukon and Mackenzie rivers. Since the early 1900s, two upper Columbia River chinook stocks have become extinct in BC and another virtually so in the Okanagan River. The latter river continues to support the largest sockeye population for the Columbia River system, but escapements there have not exceeded 40,000 in the last two decades and have dropped to as low as 1,000 in 1978. Long-term decreases have occurred in coho and chinook salmon escapements to Vancouver Island, south-central coast and Skeena-Nass rivers, and in all five eastern Pacific salmon species to the Queen Charlotte Islands. In contrast long-term sockeye escapement to the Skeena-Nass system probably has increased. In all major BC drainage areas, except the transboundary, recent coho escapements have declined significantly. Sockeye escapements show a significant increase in Vancouver Island, south-central coast, and Skeena-Nass drainage areas. In British Columbia overall, total salmon escapements have significantly increased over the last 4 decades, especially for even-and odd-year pink as well as sockeye salmon. Chum and chinook salmon escapements have shown no significant trend, but coho salmon have declined significantly. Causes for these recent changes in salmon escapement to BC systems are considered briefly.

AB  - The Quaternary South Thompson Silt, which occupies the bottom of the valley of the South Thompson River, accumulated in a late-glacial lake formed between retreating ice tongues. It contains varves and sedimentary structures related to melting of buried ice, drag of floating ice, and simple gravity movements. The thickness of the varves is as much as 250 inches in the lower part of the unit and grades upward to about 1 inch in the upper part. The silt was derived largely from erosion of till on adjacent uplands. Similar silt units occur in other valleys of the Cordilleran region.

AB  - Mio-Pliocene Chilcotin Group basalt flows form a 50 000 km2 lava plateau in south-central British Columbia. Two periods of eruptive activity at 2–3 and 6–10 Ma are indicated by a compilation of available age data, including 10 new K–Ar age determinations, and basalts from these two periods are chemically indistinguishable. The Chilcotin Group consists of thin, crudely columnar-jointed pahoehoe flows, some thick, tiered flows, pillow lava and pillow breccia, and rare silicic tephra layers. The presence of many vesicle sheets and cylinders and collapsed pahoehoe toes suggests that the basalts were volatile-rich. Known vents (gabbro and basalt plugs) for the basalt flows form a northwest trend along the axis of the lava plateau. The plateau appears to have formed from the overlap of many low-profile shield volcanoes and is similar in morphology to other plains basalts such as the Snake River Plain and parts of Iceland. Glaciation has stripped off an unknown volume of the flat-lying basalt flows., Un plateau de laves de 50 000 km2 dans le sud-centre de la Colombie-Britannique est formé de coulées de basalte appartenant au groupe Chilcotin du Mio-Pliocène. Une compilation des données géochronologiques disponibles, incluant deux déterminations récentes au K–Ar, indique deux périodes d'éruption actives il y a 2–3 et 6–10 Ma, et les basaltes respectifs de ces deux périodes sont chimiquement distincts. Le groupe Chilcotin est composé de coulées pahoehoe, minces et à joints grossièrement prismés, de coulées épaisses étagées, de laves et de brèches en coussins, et de rares couches de tephra silicique. La présence de nombreux feuillets et cylindres de vacuoles, et l'effondrement du front des coulées pahoehoe suggèrent une grande abondance de substances volatiles dans les basaltes.

AB  - Recent debates about the health of First Nations peoples have drawn a flurry of public attention and controversy, and have placed the relationship between Aboriginal well-being and reserve locations and allotments in the spotlight. Aboriginal access to medical care and the transfer of funds and responsibility for health from the federal government to individual bands and tribal councils are also bones of contention. Comprehensive discussion of such issues, however, has often been hampered by a lack of historical analysis. Colonizing Bodies examines the impact of colonization on Aboriginal health in British Columbia during the first half of the twentieth century. Mary-Ellen Kelm explores how Aboriginal bodies were materially affected by Canadian Indian policy, which placed restrictions on fishing and hunting, allocated inadequate reserves, forced children into unhealthy residential schools, and criminalized Indigenous healing. She goes on to consider how humanitarianism and colonial medicine were used to pathologize Aboriginal bodies and institute a regime of doctors, hospitals, and field matrons, all working to encourage assimilation. Finally, Kelm reveals how Aboriginal people were able to resist and alter these forces in order to preserve their own cultural understanding of their bodies, disease, and medicine.

AB  - The Coast Belt Thrust System (CBTS) is the leading edge of a west vergent contractional belt that formed along the inboard margin of the Insular superterrane in late Cretaceous time. The foreland of this contractional belt comprises a system of east dipping frontal thrusts that imbricate Jurassic and Early Cretaceous supracrustal arc sequences and related plutonic suites of the Western Coast Belt (WCB). These faults root eastward into an imbricate zone of folded thrusts and out-of-sequence reverse faults across which the metamorphic gradient has been structurally inverted. To the east and structurally above the imbricate zone is a folded stack of high-pressure thrust sheets comprising metamorphosed island arc and oceanic rocks of the Central Coast Belt (CCB). These rocks represent the exhumed crustal root of the CBTS. Metamorphosed volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks that occur in thrust sheets of the imbricate zone yield U-Pb zircon dates which support a correlation with lower-plate Jurassic and Early Cretaceous arc sequences of the WCB. Structural and geochronologic data indicate a two-stage history of Late Cretaceous shortening. During the early stage of shortening, supracrustal arc and related basin sequences along the inboard margin of the Insular superterrane were structurally imbricated and accreted to the toe (footwall) of a westward prograding accretionary complex made up of previously assembled terranes of the CCB. These early-stage structures are represented by folded thrusts in the imbricate and hinterland zones of the CBTS. The timing of this early-stage thrusting is bracketed by the emplacement of synorogenic plutonic suites, which yield U-Pb zircon dates of 97 ± 1 Ma and 96 +6/−3 Ma. Late-stage shortening involved both thin-skinned thrusting and folding of Jura-Cretaceous arc sequences in the WCB foreland and out-of-sequence thrusting of higher-grade thrust sheets in the imbricate and hinterland zones of the CBTS. In the foreland this episode of deformation is bracketed by late-and postkinematic plutons, which yield U-Pb zircon dates of 94 ± 2 Ma and 91 +4/−3 Ma, respectively. In the imbricate zone, this episode of deformation is bracketed by the emplacement of synkinematic and postkinematic plutons, which yield U-Pb zircon dates of 96 +6/−3 Ma and 94 +6/−5 Ma, respectively. The development of thick-skinned out-of-sequence thrusts in the imbricate and hinterland zones of the CBTS signals a northeastward migration of the deformation front in Late Cretaceous time. This shift in the locus of thrusting resulted in southwestward telescoping and structural inversion of the metamorphic hinterland and may account for the complex stacking order and thermal history of the Southern Coast Belt.

AB  - This book is a collection of papers reflecting the latest advances in geographic research on health, disease, and well-being. It spans a wide range of topics, theoretical perspectives, and methodologies - including anti-racism, post-colonialism, spatial statistics, spatiotemporal modeling, political ecology, and social network analysis. Health issues in various regions of the world are addressed by interdisciplinary authors, who include scholars from epidemiology, medicine, public health, demography, and community studies. The book covers the major themes in this field such as health inequalities; environmental health; spatial analysis and modeling of disease; health care provision, access, and utilization; health and wellbeing; and global/transnational health and health issues in the global south. There is also a specially commissioned book review in addition to the chapters included in these six sections. Together, these chapters show cogently how geographic perspectives and methods can contribute in significant ways to advancing our understanding of the complex interactions between social and physical environments and health behaviors and outcomes. This book was published as a special issue of Annals of the Association of American Geographers.

AB  - Floods are widely recognized as a common and largely distributed natural hazard with potential for causing loss of life, property damage, disruption of the economy and environmental damages. All geographic regions of Canada are susceptible to the deleterious impacts of floods. Recent flood events in Canada and elsewhere have contributed to the common perception that floods and associated damages have been increasing in recent years. Given the ubiquitous nature of this hazard, a thorough examination of the many complex and interrelated aspects of natural and man-made floods in Canada is long overdue. This special issue contains 27 papers dealing with a variety of different aspects of floods in Canada. The first 16 papers deal with physical aspects of floods and include a collection of case study papers that present recent flood events in Canada, following a common format to allow readers to compare and contrast recent flood events in different regions of Canada. The last 11 papers focus on ecological, social and management aspects of floods. The papers included in this special issue present topical information on flooding and also challenge common perceptions of floods and flood processes in Canada.

AB  - Problem-solving is embedded deeply in the digital DNA of GIS. Most projects involving GIS 1.0 and 2.0 raise community weaknesses, failures and other problems and use them to motivate change. The projects often create a future that does not differ greatly from the past or last long. Although looking into community problems is important and sometimes necessary, the steps of problem-solving do not always leave people feeling happy. To inspire communities to create change based on their strengths and achievements, and to provide better participant experience, this article develops the concept of a new form of GIS called Appreciative GIS (AGIS). AGIS are grounded in the affirmative premise that every community, however challenged, is gifted with certain assets, potentials and strengths which, when effectively exploited, can take that community to a better and sustainable future. Based on Earth's internal structure, the article develops a useful layered community model where crust, mantle and core strata represent the community's body, life-draining and life-giving elements in that order. The model helps explain the different views of the community from current GIS and AGIS perspectives. A Total GIS (TGIS) cube is also developed and used to indicate that current GIS commonly focus on elements of the mantle or what we do not have, what we cannot do and what makes us weak. AGIS, on the other hand, dig up the core and cultivate what we have, what we can possibly do and what makes us strong. In a significant departure from the linear approach of problem-solving, the article suggests implementing AGIS through a 7G cyclical method. The article contends that although AGIS may not be the whole enchilada, they can serve as a beacon of hope and a powerful source of inspiration especially for individuals and groups who are perceived or made to perceive themselves as dysfunctional, weak or poor.

AB  - The Song: Canoe Song was born from the Cheslatta River in northern British Columbia. After hearing stories from the elders of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation, Rachelle wanted to write a song about the displacement of First Nations People through the exploitation of the lands and waters of their home. She is grateful for the help of Roy Henry Vickers on this meditative musical journey, to Lillian Campbell and her musical brother and all-star producer Joby Baker, who took this song to a new level. The Video: This video follows the 600km journey of a canoe named Manyhands (Nunsulsailus) from a Gitxsan village on the Skeena river to the historic gathering of nations in Bella Bella, BC for the Heiltsuk Nations' Qatuwas Festival in 2014. Manyhands brought the spirit of this song to life during its trip down the Skeena river, through the Skeena estuary and into the Pacific ocean where it joined a family of canoes and thousands of paddlers from up and down the Pacific Coast. Manyhands was honoured to paddle alongside Nisga'a, Tsimshian, Haida, Gitga'at and Kitasoo/Xaixais canoes who pulled together to represent the north coast at Qatuwas 2014. The Canoe: Nunsulsailis is a Tsartlip word meaning many hands. This name was chosen to embody the spirit of many hands working together, supporting one another and pulling together in unison to enable a canoe (and a person) to travel safely for many miles in all conditions over the course of a lifetime. Roy Henry Vickers inspired Clipper to create a Northern Dancer canoe series, of which Manyhands was the very first canoe produced. Manyhands has traveled thousands of kilometres along the BC coast with hundreds of paddlers, including the historic 1997 journey from Hazelton to Victoria's inner Harbour. This music video is dedicated to the people of British Columbia's north coast, who are pulling together to protect the lands and waters of their home. shot from a canoe on a Canon 5D2

AB  - Marine spatial planning (MSP) is becoming increasingly used in the sustainable management of marine and coastal ecosystems. However, limitations on time and resources often restrict the data available for MSP and limit public engagement and participation in the MSP process. While citizen science is being increasingly used to provide fine-scale environmental data across large terrestrial planning areas, there has been little uptake in MSP to date. This paper demonstrates how consistent citizen observations can be used to identify hotspots of good and poor environmental health across a MSP region, and where environmental health has improved or degraded in the past five years; information that is difficult to obtain by other means. The study demonstrates how citizen science provides valuable insight into environmental health across a MSP region, while fostering a supportive space for the public to contribute their own observations and participate in the planning process.

AB  - The move towards partnerships and collaborative governance models has been advocated in global health discussions for many years now. A case example methodology was applied to this study. It was composed of a document review and semi-structured interviews with key informants from five environment and public health partnerships in the province of Ontario, Canada. These case examples highlight the merits and the challenges of diverse partnerships, and the importance of governance and leadership models, scaling up (and out) impact, and cross-cultural communications to these arrangements. Further work is required to articulate situations in which public health partnerships can be strengthened.

AB  - The Maitland Watershed Partnerships (MWPs) is a multi-stakeholder forum established in 1999 in an agricultural watershed in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. This paper presents 10 lessons emerging from the participatory evaluation of the MWPs carried out in 2005. As suggested in the literature and highlighted by the experience of the MWPs, multi-stakeholder collaboration and integration is about learning how to cope with and take advantage from difference, diversity and divergence. Watershed partnerships are arenas in which different types of knowledges, diverse values and divergent sectoral perspectives, are confronted. In this context, inter-organizational leadership is essential to develop and sustain collaborative advantage among multiple public, private and civil society actors. According to the experience of the MWPs, however, embracing difference, diversity and divergence should go well beyond initial planning stages. Instead, pursuing compromise and agreement should also be at the forefront during the monitoring and evaluation stages. Negotiating indicators for monitoring and evaluation that can address water management both as a social process and a technical process is critical, as is making the distinction between partnership outputs and partnership outcomes.

AB  - This paper examines two participatory environmental planning cases in which modelling played an important role. The cases occurred in Vermont. They provide contrasts in the use of technology to model future scenarios: magic markers and mylar for forest mapping as compared to computer modelling for watershed assessment. The paper describes how modelling and models were employed to integrate knowledge, interests and values in each case. It explores two dimensions of legitimacy, procedural and scientific expertise, in these modelling processes. It concludes with the implications of decision-making authority for legitimacy and the integration of knowledge and values.

AB  - Collaborative environmental management with stakeholder engagement is increasingly employed around the world. A key component of collaboration is social learning; through deliberation, stakeholders with different perspectives and information can learn from each other and develop a shared vision and plan for moving forward. This study compares social learning in collaborative watershed partnerships across two states within federal systems: Ohio (USA) and Niedersachsen (Germany). Analysis indicates that, although processes in both contexts generated social learning, Ohio partnerships exhibited significantly higher levels. A key difference linked to these results is the higher levels of local process control and individual efficacy in Ohio.

AB  - Australia's Murray–Darling basin (MDB) water plan is an ambitious attempt to balance ecological, social and economic benefits, where a key aspect of the reform process has been recovery of water for environmental use. This paper focuses on a set of initiatives established by a local non-governmental organisation and an Indigenous community designed to engage with local values and priorities and incorporate them into this complex river basin governance system. Contrary to expectations that local and basin-scale interests and outcomes will diverge, the case studies reveal the ability for local groups to collaboratively manage both land and water resources to achieve locally important outcomes, and contribute to basin-scale outcomes. The analysis also highlights a progressive style of community-based environmental management for water management that utilises multiple institutional arrangements and planning pathways to protect the values that are important to local communities, and to nest those values within the broader effort to sustainably manage the basin's water resources.

AB  - To ensure the protection and sustainability of our water,practitioners agree that it must be governed in new ways. Some governments and watershed groups are responding byimplementing new and innovative decision-makingarrangements. One emerging model is collaborative watershedgovernance, which reorients decision-making authorities andprocesses, and reorganizes them to align with watershedboundaries, rather than traditional political jurisdictionsand borders. However, this method of governance faces manychallenges, including the need to build the capacity andskills of on-the-ground players to effectively adopt thisapproach.

AB  - Extensive engagement and consultation with end-usercommunities has made it clear that further work needs to bedone to bridge the gap between traditional and technicalknowledge around water and wastewater systems. The existingknowledge gap acts as a barrier that prevents Indigenouscommunities from engaging in decision-making processes.Using tools to create a space, referred to as a “tradingzone”, that facilitates cross-disciplinary orcross-cultural dialogue and collaboration, couldsignificantly enhance community capacity and engagementaround water and wastewater systems. Previous work has showntranslating, developing, and presenting outputs instorytelling formats allows for greater accessibility,uptake and engagement in Indigenous communities. Therefore,this project proposes to use storytelling to engageparticipating Indigenous communities and extend theknowledge and outputs that have contributed to thedevelopment of a trading zone.

The process of making Kraft pulp requires access to a considerable volume of water, which is why most pulp mills are located close to major rivers. Canfor Pulp clearly recognizes their dependence on the Nechako watershed and the role that Canfor must play in water management and stewardship. In order to manage this water resource effectively, we must understand the ways in which we use water now, as well as what our water needs will be in the future.

Dr. Parkes is no stranger to Rotary, with Rotary helping to start her extensive career as an Ambassadorial Scholar over 20 years ago in Brussels. Dr. Parkes presentation focused on Ecosystems and the cumulative relationship of Ecosystems with health, both Public and Personal Health. Dr. Parkes discussion related to the &quot;Stuart-Nechako Watershed&quot; because of the Nechako Rotary Club, but her talk was relative to all watersheds and ecosystems, regardless of their location, as they are all relative to the long term effect on our environmental and personal health. The &quot;Stuart-Nechako Watershed&quot; is approximately the same size as Switzerland, but with a much smaller population. &quot;ECO&quot; is a Greek word meaning &quot;House&quot;. Ecosystems relate to such things as: Air, Water, (both surface and ground water) environmental dynamics, land use and practices, active lifestyles, etc. The bottom line being that the &quot;Upstream Effects Causes Downstream Impacts.&quot; Whatever happens in a ecosystem, within a watershed, will have an impact on the ultimate well being of the environment and the related health of everything downstream. We regularly see and appreciate these facts more from the research and information being presented by people such as Dr. Parkes and the other people involved in the study of cause and effect on our environmental systems. Rotarian Doctor William Osai thanked Dr. Parkes with another donation to our Rotary Polio Plus Program.

Two case studies in develop- ing web-based public participation GIS (PPGIS), one local and one regional, are described in detail. Results from the live testing of these systems are shown. These are discussed in the light of recent developments in `cyberdemocracy' and conclusions are drawn about principles of on-line PPGIS and problems associated with public participation, user interaction, and familiarity with IT, copyright issues, access to the Internet, and relevant political structures.

AB  - SAVORY: Alcan has already spent close to half of the $1.3 billion cost. It has a binding agreement with the federal government allowing the project to proceed without an environmental review. The province has asked Ottawa to rescind that 1987 agreement and, it says, Ottawa is responsible for compensation if compensation is owed. But Ottawa says, not if B.C. killed the project, it isn't.SAVORY: In the '50s, Kemano 1 brought power to Alcan's smelter at Kitimat and sharply reduced the water flows in the Nechako, a valuable salmon river. Part Two would have produced more power and further reduced the water flows. Environmentalists and natives aligned themselves with fishing interests to fight the project and won.

Instead, the two sides have made a deal: Alcan gets cheap hydro power, and BC gets jobs.MILEWSKI: Of course, that was what they said ten years ago, when the federal and provincial governments both agreed to a huge expansion of Alcan's smelting operations at Kitimat, in northern BC. But Alcan spent $500-million on a new power project only to have the NDP government cancel it, saying it would wreck the salmon run on the Nechako river. Alcan said it would sue, but now that's off. BC has agreed to supply all the power that Alcan needs at low prices, so all is forgiven.

AB  - Ice, of course, is expected, but what's happened in Prince George this winter is extraordinary. Usually when the river freezes, it creates a sheet of ice and the water can flow underneath quite easily. But back in December, there was a deep freeze followed by a thaw, and that's what created all the boulders, almost icebergs that have now jammed up for close to 27 kilometres along the Nechako River, in many places blocking the river from flowing. Dikes have been built, homes have been sand bagged, including Robin and Martin's.In British Columbia, freezing temperatures have caused that ice jam in Prince George to grow again to 27 kilometres. It's been an ongoing problem this winter in Prince George, where two rivers surround a good portion of the city. The ice is clogging up the Nechako River, starting a few kilometres from where it meets the Fraser. So the city, faced with flooding once again, today attempted something a little different. The CBC's Chris Brown reports.

AB  - In April of this year, Alcan Aluminum filed a $535 million lawsuit against the BC government over the government's 1995 cancellation of Alcan's infamous Kemano Completion Project. Scrapped by former BC Premier Mike Harcourt, Alcan's huge hydro-electric project was destined to divert 88 percent of BC's Nechako River, essentially swapping wild salmon for electricity that Alcan could sell to the US via BC Hydro. When Alcan sued for compensation this spring, BC Premier Glen Clark grabbed his stick-on hairy chest and thundered "British Columbians won't tolerate several hundred million dollars in compensation to a company which was pursuing a project which was uneconomic and environmentally unsound." Four months later, while ranting about those greedy Alaskan salmon fishermen and enemy-of-BC environmentalists, Clark quietly handed the Nechako and all its salmon to Alcan, along with some $50 million/year in subsidies, and he tried to hide the giveaway behind specious job-creation rhetoric. The same trick had worked nicely for Clark two months earlier with his June announcement of the phony "jobs and timber accord." Media minimized the fact that Clark was handing lots of timber and cash to an industry that had promised nothing in return.

TI  - Kemano completion project
TY  - conferenceProceedings
AB  - MALAREK: Alcan's Kemano project was an amazing piece of engineering. It actually reversed the flow of an entire river system. This is the Nechako River. First Alcan built a dam here to stop the flow of the river. This flooded all the lakes creating a huge reservoir. Alcan then drilled a tunnel through the mountains here to siphon water off for its hydro generating plant at Kemano. They then built a spillway here to channel the unused water in the reservoir back down the Nechako River. The important thing to remember is that the more water that is taken from here, the less water there is to go back down the Nechako River. British Columbia and Alcan let nothing stand in the way of the Kemano project. Thousands of hectares of prime timber were flooded. River channels were gouged out of the landscape. And in 1952, Carrier Indians living on Lake Cheslatta were forced to abandon their homes because of the rising waters of the reservoir. The Cheslatta Indians were given only a few days notice to leave. Then in one of the more sordid episodes in B.C. history, Indian Affairs officials forged signatures on documents that surrendered reserve lands to Alcan. And company officials ordered their houses burnt to the ground. To this day the changing water levels in the reservoir sometimes flood Cheslatta grave sites. But the only damage that attracted much attention in the early fifties was the damage to the river and its fish. The dam completely dried up part of the river which caused a sharp drop in numbers of salmon. From the project's beginning, scientists worried about the impact on salmon. [GORDON HARTMAN] is a fishery biologist who worked in government for 27 years.[VICTOR MALAREK]: There was only one thing standing between Alcan and its new project: the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, the DFO. Alcan was prepared to fight the Department and the people who worked here in Nanaimo had no idea how tough that fight would be. The Department's purpose, in fact its legal obligation, is to protect the fish -- it had the power to stop the project if it thought the fish were in danger. The conflict intensified in the late '70s when Alcan challenged the DFO's authority. It began to divert more water from the river to produce more power at its existing generating plant. The Department told Alcan the fish were in danger, and in 1980 got a court injunction forcing Alcan to release more water back into the river. The Department faced a challenge from Alcan on several fronts. Alcan wanted more water immediately and even more water in the future for Kemano completion. The Department put 15 scientists to work to study the impact that that would have on the fish. But it was taking years. So in 1985, Alcan told the DFO it could wait no longer. The two sides decided to take the issue back to court and the Department ordered its scientists to prepare their testimony against the company. That testimony would never be presented in court. In Ottawa there was a new team with new rules. This government wanted accommodation with big business not confrontation. The Minister of Fisheries at the time was [TOM SIDDON], an aerospace engineer from Richmond, B.C.. His deputy minister was [PETER MEYBOOM], now a private consultant. Meyboom says the Conservative government was trying to find new solutions to environmental conflicts with business. Did you get called by the Minister's Office, Tom Siddon, and get told: Let's get this thing underway now?MALAREK: By early 1986 Meyboom was pushing the Department towards a compromise with Alcan. The Department offered Alcan 50 per cent of the original flow of the Nechako. The Department said under certain conditions, it might give Alcan 75 per cent of the water. But Alcan wanted more: up to 88 per cent of the water from the river. The dispute over the Nechako was about to tear the DFO apart. Many of its scientists argued that any concessions to Alcan were unacceptable because they would all cause damage to the fish. The 5th estate spoke to five of the scientists heavily involved in Kemano research: Harold Mundie, an expert on stream ecology, has been with DFO for 27 years; [COLE SHIRVELL] studies stream flows and fish habitats, he's been there for 14 years; [WILLIAM SCHOUWENBURG], a senior DFO biologist recently retired after 32 years; [ROBERT BAMS], an expert on salmon incubation, worked there for 37 years; [DON ALDERDICE], an expert on fish habitats, now retired, had a career at the DFO lasting 40 years.

AB  - KIRKLAND LAKE, ON, Dec. 2 /CNW/ - RJK Explorations Ltd., (RJX.A: TSV) ("RJK") wishes to announce that it has entered into a property option agreement whereby RJK can acquire an undivided 100% interest in 18 claims covering 8,250 hectares in the prolific Nechako Plateau, called the "West Blackwater Gold Property." The West Blackwater Gold Property is located in central British Columbia, approximately 110 km by road southwest of Vanderhoof. The optioned claims lie to the west-southwest and are contiguous to the Blackwater Project of Richfield Ventures Corp. (RVC). Investor interest in the Richfield Blackwater gold discovery has resulted in the blanket staking of the Nechako plateau area surrounding Richfield.

AB  - PRINCE GEORGE, B.C. (CP) - The fact that more than 200 people lined the banks B.C.'s Nechako River to watch a captivity-reared sturgeon being released shows people are interested in the plight of the endangered species, says a person involved in the project.The two groups have been charged with finding a way to help recover the white sturgeon stocks in the Nechako River.The Nechako River's water flows and temperature are partially impacted by how much water is spilled from the Nechako Reservoir, which was dammed to provide hydroelectric power for Alcan's aluminum smelter in Kitimat.

TI  - Selling the river: the Kemano Completion Project on BC's Nechako River is a classic case of megaproject madness, where massive investments must generate massive returns, at the expense of the environment and local communities

AB  - Upon completion of the tunnel, Alcan was able to divert water from the reservoir down the tunnel's 860 - metre drop to the newly completed Kemano powerhouse. The electricity from the powerhouse's eight generators, the turbines of each driven by the diverted water, was then transmitted along an 82 - kilometre, Alcan - built power line to the town of Kitimat where the company's aluminum smelter had been constructed. From the Kemano powerhouse the diverted water from the Nechako Reservoir was channelled into the Kemano River, which then carried it to the ocean. As promised, Alcan's megaproject opened up the northwest and north central portions of the province to development. Alcan was directly responsible for the creation of the town sites of Kemano (current population 250) and Kitimat (current population approximately 12,000).While the damage the original project inflicted on the land and the people of the area was substantial, it was only the beginning. According to the 1949 agreement Alcan had the right to all of the water in the Nechako and it planned from the outset to maximize its lawful use of this resource. In 1978, Alcan announced its intention to expand its hydroelectric generating capacity by building a second tunnel through the coastal mountains to feed another generating facility at Kemano, the results of which would reduce the Nechako to 13 percent of its pre - Kenney Dam flow. Between the end of the filling of the reservoir in 1957 and 1978, Alcan had allowed the Nechako to flow at approximately 67 percent of its naturallevel. But, in 1978 the company entered into a lucrative agreement with B.C. Hydro to sell its excess power, and water flow in the river dropped dramatically.Consequently, the 1987 Settlement Agreement was negotiated between the federal and provincial governments and Alcan, which gave Alcan the flow regimes it had wanted all along: 30 percent of the original flow until completion of the second tunnel, at which time Alcan would guarantee a minimum flow of 12 percent. In effect, Alcan gave up the rights to 12 percent of the Nechako from the original 1949 agreement.

AB  - This is the report of a workshop that focussed on three questions: the evidence for a decline in the recruitment of juvenile white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) in the Nechako River, British Columbia; the potential causes of this decline; and the experimental management regimes that could be used to resolve uncertainties on the cause of recruitment problems and thereby direct mitigation strategies. After an introduction on the proceedings, section 2 reviews the data used to evaluate recruitment trends. It includes a comparison of Nechako stock age composition with Fraser River stocks, an indication of historical changes in Nechako stock age composition, and interpretations of the decline in catch rates 1982-99. Section 3 presents a sturgeon population model used to make additional interpretations of recruitment trends, and evaluates predicted estimates of recruitment patterns over time, based on current age-structure data. Section 4 summarizes the workshop discussions focussed on identifying potential causes of the recruitment failure. The final section summarizes discussions on the design of an experimental management program intending to identify successful strategies for recovering the Nechako white sturgeon stock.

AB  - [Gordon Hartman]: The recreational fishery in the upper Nechako river is already cut in half. The likelihood of restoring or maintaining that fishery under the flow regime that will come in if the settlement agreement goes through is extremely small. The sturgeon, according to the provincial biologist . . . will become functionally extinct . . . I would anticipate that the chinook salmon would essentially disappear from the Nechako . . . the sockeye will be put in enormous jeopardy because of . . . accumulated effects of temperature, sediment and pollution. It's not even addressed in the impact assessment documents.Hartman: A group of scientists in the Department of Fisheries and Oceans met in June 1987 and they discussed the concept of mitigating with DFO's base flows. They concluded it would be very difficult. They then discussed mitigation in the context of Alcan's fish and other use flows . . . and concluded that in fact they could not do adequate mitigation with that flow regime.Hartman: There seems to be an assumption that it's either we lay out this half-billion, or we have the better flows for the fishery, which will in some sense exclude all of Alcan's priorities. I would submit to you that we have never looked properly at the possibility that there could be still a water allocation for Alcan and a far more equitable flow for fisheries without this cost accounting . . . who says that we have to pay half a billion dollars?

AB  - KEMANO - IT was hailed in the 1950s as an engineering extravaganza. The icy torrents of the northern Nechako River were reversed through huge tunnels to hydroelectric generators entombed in a mountain. The purpose was to provide power for a new Alcan aluminum plant in Kitimat.Although expanding Kemano will lower Nechako water levels, Alcan says they will be high enough for salmon migrating from the Pacific to spawn. Opponents say the Nechako -- a tributary of the Fraser River, the world's most important salmon river -- is already too low and less water threatens the whole system's salmon run.PRIME USER: Alcan smelter at nearby Kitimat. Power can represent 45 per cent of cost of aluminum production, but Kemano is so cheap it represents 10-15 per cent.

AB  - We had heard about the Nechako and Alcan before we left. Flows had been reduced, salmon were being monitored, power would be generated. In Vancouver, the fate of this river was abstract, rhetorical, questionable even. Now it is in our backyard.When William Butler crossed the ``wide Nacharcole'' {sic} in 1870 he wrote of a swift and robust river that channelled a broad northwestern watershed into the central Interior. As the century turned, the Nechako supported paddle-wheeler traffic between Fraser Lake and Fort George. Today the Nechako is a shallow and ailing river.As you cross the bridge in [Vanderhoof], you see how shifting islands of silt slow and guide the current around encroaching vegetation. The river here is sluggish and emaciated. Ninety kilometres upstream at Alcan's Kenny Dam, there is barely a river to speak of. On one side lies the blue expanse of the Knewstubb reservoir, on the other a dehydrated facsimile of the Nechako. This is where we spent B.C. Rivers Day.

AB  - The biggest threat to Alcan's billion-dollar dream of completing the second phase of its Kemano project may prove to be the tiny, impoverished Cheslatta Indian band.Forty-five years ago, the Cheslatta were abandoned to their fate. It was a nightmare of shattered self-esteem and internalized anger that came to life as alcoholism, violence and suicide.In the basement of a log cabin, from a couple of offices crowded with filing cabinets, a fax with an autodialler and a sheaf of freedom of information forms, the Cheslatta have been waging a tireless propaganda war.

T2  - The Province
TY  - newspaperArticle
AB  - When the Nechako Reservoir was created in the 1950s, the province granted Alcan the timber rights to the submerged trees. The province did not require that Alcan remove the trees from the areas to be flooded, but did require Alcan to restore public road and water trail access, and to re-establish wharves and public approaches to pre-flooding conditions, up to a maximum total cost of $250,000 (1950 dollars).Alcan has met its clearing requirements specified in the 1950 agreement. Since 1979, Alcan has contributed approximately $500,000 annually to a timber clearing program, which serves to increase boater safety, to provide refuge from wind and storm, and to improve the reservoir appearance. Despite continued efforts, Alcan has only cleared approximately 10 per cent of the timber in the reservoir.The sockeye salmon of the Stuart and Nautley rivers are by far the major fishery resource of the Nechako River basin . . . The Commission recognizes that the provisions of the Settlement Agreement provide the opportunity for greater protection for sockeye with the KCP. However, the Commission has concluded that the negotiated provisions should be augmented to protect the potential future value of the sockeye resource. The Commission recommends that cooling water releases from the Kenney Dam Release Facility be increased . . . With these releases there will be the opportunity to undertake additional enhancements on the Stuart and Nautley systems which could very significantly increase the annual value of this fishery.

And of 600 streams in the Lower Mainland, the majority are considered threatened.

AB  - A B.C. native band has filed a lawsuit against Alcan and the federal and provincial government over the company's hydro-electric project in northern B.C., saying it violates the band's constitutional rights.The Cheslatta band said they were never consulted when Alcan first built the Kenney dam at the headwaters of the Nechako River in 1952. The dam reversed the flow of the river through a 16-kilometre tunnel to a power plant in Kemano that was used for Alcan's aluminum smelter in Kitimat, 600 km west of Prince George.The Cheslatta lawsuit is the latest example of the clash of competing interests in Alcan's hydro-electric project in the north. In 1987, the federal government allowed Alcan to use 88 per cent of the Nechako River for its Kemano Completion Project. In 1995, the province cancelled the project, citing environmental concerns. Last year, the B.C. government settled with Alcan, guaranteeing the company cheap electricity if it built a $1.2 billion smelter in Kitimat.

AB  - Alcan built the Kenney dam at the headwaters of the Nechako River in 1952 to power its aluminum smelter in Kitimat. The dam reversed the flow of the river through a 16-kilometre tunnel to a power plant at Kemano and led to flooding of the Cheslatta lands and reduced water flows in the river.Under the recommendation, the province and Alcan would each pay $50 million for the project. Alcan has already agreed to spend up to $50 million in matching funds.The committee that wrote the report was created in 1997 in the wake of the NDP government's cancellation of Alcan's Kemano completion project, which would have seen another dam built which would have further reduced water flow in the river. It was part of an agreement between Alcan and the province to end a lawsuit in which the aluminum giant was seeking compensation for the cancellation.

AB  - [Richard Wozney] said Alcan is breaking the agreement by cutting capacity of the Kitimat smelter in favour of selling power, threatening 1,800 Alcan jobs and the economy of the city of 11,000."In 2001, the reservoir was low and Alcan shut down 40 per cent of production and continued to make power sales to B.C. Hydro," said Ray Brady, Kitimat organizer of Save the Northwest. "This is the first time in 50 years that Alcan cut production in favour of power sales. That's what kicked Kitimat city council and concerned citizens into gear."Attorney-General Geoff Plant wrote to Liberal Skeena MLA Roger Harris two months ago acknowledging that nothing in the agreement precludes Alcan's power sales. Litigation "is neither warranted nor desirable" as Alcan won't release B.C. from legal claims over Kemano until 2005.

AB  - Since then, the Kemano power station plugged into the B.C. power grid and B.C. Hydro began buying surplus electricity from Alcan.The deal only lasts until 2024, with a possible extension to 2029. After that Alcan is free to sell Kemano power on the open market and B.C. may have to match whatever price energy-starved Californians are prepared to pay.Further clouding the issue is the fact the nearly 900 megawatts of Kemano power is increasingly important to B.C. as an energy crunch nears that could force construction of a new dam on the Peace River. Energy-intensive aluminum production in Kitimat may look less and less wise.

AB  - Tse-Khene territory, lying mostly in the Arctic drainage basin, meant this first nation had no direct access to salmon. Instead, dispersing across the landscape in family-based hunting bands, they became skilled and highly mobile hunters of big game. Moose, caribou, bighorn sheep, mountain goats and bears were their preferred prey. The Tse'Khene also relied upon beaver, marmots, hares and porcupines and in [Simon Fraser]'s time still occasionally crossed the Rockies to hunt buffalo and elk, probably at the margins of old territories they'd been forced to abandon in the 18th century.Early fur traders noted the cultural and linguistic similarities between the Tse'Khene and the Beaver Indians east of the Rockies. Even in Fraser's time, fur traders surmised in their journals that the Tse'Khene were actually a branch of the Beavers who were driven to new territory when the Cree even farther east and the Beaver of what's now northwestern Alberta acquired guns.The Tse'Khene were further squeezed by the powerful Carrier nation to the west and by the fierce Shuswaps to the south who had massacred the Tse'Khene when they ventured into the North Thompson River country. This event occurred sometime in the generation before contact in 1793 because [Alexander Mackenzie] reported an account from a Tse'Khene woman enslaved at the time.

AB  - Alcan has always been free to sell power. [Donald Brenner] explained that after the Second World War, the government of the day was engaged in a "nation-building" exercise and used natural resources and land as incentives for infrastructure development. Alcan was given permits and licence "to store, divert and use" water from the Nechako and Nanika River watersheds and to develop works for the generation and supply of power at Kemano. The reason it didn't sell power sooner is that Kemano wasn't on B.C. Hydro's grid until 1978.The judgment has put all the cards in Alcan's hands. Now it's time for Kitimat to stop filing lawsuits, petitions and appeals, drop its belligerence and get on with the job of persuading Alcan to proceed with a planned $2-billion smelter expansion. Michel Jacques, president and CEO of Alcan, told The Vancouver Sun editorial board on Monday that his company is more than willing to sit down with the elected officials of Kitimat to move this massive project forward.

AB  - Abstract Toxic cyanobacteria are of increasing concern in the Pacific Northwest region of North America. Toxic blooms have been documented in Idaho, northern California, Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia and have caused animal poisonings, lake closures, and public health concerns. Microcystins are the most commonly detected cyanotoxins in this region and have been found at water concentrations from <1 μg/L to 30 mg/L. Anatoxins have also been measured in water bodies throughout the region and have been implicated in the deaths of both domestic and wild animals. Environmental factors associated with the occurrence of toxic blooms have been studied in several western Washington lakes. In these lakes, toxic blooms occurred during conditions of high phosphorus, water temperatures, and water column stability. Migration of cyanobacteria from the sediments contributed to toxic blooms in one of the lakes. Although regulations have not been formally adopted by the states and province in this region, some local jurisdictions use the World Health Organization proposed drinking water guideline of 1 μg/L microcystin-LR to close lakes to recreational use and for drinking water supplies. Recommendations currently advocated by Oregon take into account genera-specific differences, as well as separate, less stringent guidelines for recreational water bodies not used for drinking water.

AB  - Les relations entre les fluctuations des niveaux des eaux souterraine et les variations climatiques passées sont explorées à l’aide des données disponibles provenant du réseau piézométrique provincial, des données climatiques et des données hydrométriques des deux principales zones hydroclimatiques de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces registres de puits ont été lancés pour la plupart vers la fin des années 1970 ou dans les années 1980, ce qui nous donne seulement entre 20 et 30 années d’enregistrements tout au plus, et seuls quelques-uns de ces puits permettent de surveiller les aquifères dans des zones « vierges » qui reflètent la variabilité naturelle; les autres ayant subi l’influence de l’activité humaine. Les niveaux mensuels moyens des eaux souterraines ont été utilisés pour classer manuellement les puits en cycles saisonniers dominés par les précipitations et la fonte des neiges. Les tendances temporelles des niveaux des eaux souterraines et une simple mesure de l’alimentation en eau souterraine ont été calculées à l’aide du coefficient de corrélation de rang de Spearman non paramétrique sur une période commune allant de 1976 à 1999. Cette période a été sélectionnée afin qu’elle coïncide avec la phase positive de l’oscillation décennale du Pacifique (ODP) de façon à éliminer l’incidence éventuelle qu’un changement dans l’ODP pourrait avoir sur les niveaux des eaux souterraines et sur les tendances en matière d’alimentation. Dans l’ensemble, les niveaux des eaux souterraines vers la fin de l’été semblent avoir diminué partout dans la province. Les tendances en matière d’alimentation de la nappe souterraine étaient plus variables, celles-ci pouvant être tant positives que négatives. Cependant, la plupart des résultats liés aux tendances étaient non significatifs. Cette évaluation a été compliquée par des facteurs comme la nature variée du climat dans différentes parties de la province, lequel détermine le régime hydrologique (pluvial, nival, englacé, mixte), la complexité du système aquifère en ce qu’il se rapporte à la relation entre les eaux souterraines et les eaux de surface, et les sources éloignées de nombreuses rivières dans les régions montagneuses de la province.

AB  - The provincial legislature of British Columbia (B.C.), Canada, recently enacted Bill 27, which requires all municipal official community plans to contain greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets and associated policies by the end of May 2010. While the legislation is unique by North American standards in its mandate, it lacks particular design features that scholars believe to be critical for fostering compliance. To examine municipal compliance with Bill 27, we address two research questions: what per cent of B.C. municipalities adopted targets by the legislated deadline, and which factors explain variation in target adoption across municipalities? To help answer these questions, we utilise univariate descriptive statistics, bivariate analyses (including mean comparisons and correlation analysis), and binary logistic regression analysis. We find that nearly two-thirds of municipalities adopted targets by the deadline, and that target adoption across municipalities varies with particular municipal characteristics. Our findings highlight the importance of crafting legislation in a strategic fashion in order to maximise effectiveness, and the potential need for provincial governments to target particular sub-populations for additional education and assistance regarding climate action planning. We suggest directions for future research, including additional analysis of the content of adopted targets and associated policies by B.C. municipalities.

AB  - The recently-announced Inquiry on Federal Water Policy presents an opportunity for thorough review and reform of the federal government’s approaches to its responsibilities for water management in Canada. By means of publications, public hearings across the country, and other activities the Inquiry can be expected to improve public awareness of water problems and of needed improvements in water policy.The growing and competing demands on water suggest the need for a more comprehensive approach to water management, with systematic consideration given not only to industrial and commercial values but also to aesthetic and environmental benefits and the tradeoffs among them. This implies a considerable change from our traditionally fragmented approach to water resource development in Canada.

AB  - As tools for improving the sustainability of forest management, criteria and indicator (C&I) frameworks have grown in popularity over the last decade. Such frameworks have been largely derived from top-down approaches to determining critical measures of forest management success. While useful, they fail to capture many C&I of critical importance to local populations, who experience forest management strategies first hand and who have their own definitions of sustainability. Using archival materials, our research begins to identify one First Nation's forest values and compares these local-level C&I with three well-known C&I frameworks for sustainable forestry. We demonstrate that local-level definitions can provide additional C&I, as well as additional levels of detail to C&I that they share with the national and international frameworks. Both are crucial to developing strategies for sustainable management that meet local as well as broader needs and desires.

The following day we stopped in Burns Lake for another community event, breaking up the nine hour drive to Dawson Creek. In this community we heard about people experiencing the repercussions of organizing against pipelines when so many around them have been bought off by industry. There were discussions about how solidarity and support could be built locally and in other communities given the attacks people were facing as they courageously stood in the way of projects threatening to destroy the land. We learned that activism can be complicated in small towns where everyone knows each other, where families can often be divided to further corporate and industry interest. We have gained a tremendous amount of respect for these people who aren't afraid to fight these issues despite the fact that it can be deeply challenging. Resistance to the Pacific Trails Pipeline is strong and growing stronger. We leave this community in the spirit of hope, and travel now to Treaty 8 territory where Oil and Gas industry has begun to eat away at life and balance. http://vancouver.mediacoop.ca/story/rising-tide-building-resistance-tour-community-eve/17577

TI  - Beneath the waters : a microhistory of Ootsa Lake, a northern Eurocanadian community
TY  - thesis
AU  - Christopher Beach
AB  - The building of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railroad across Canada in the years prior to the First World War led to an unprecedented degree of non-aboriginal settlement in northern British Columbia. Thousands of euroCanadians flocked to the North in search of inexpensive agricultural land, spreading out and creating communities in even the most remote sub-regions adjacent to the railway corridor. This thesis explores the development of one such community, Ootsa Lake, from its inception shortly after the turn of the century through to its displacement fifty years alter. The community, composed of the four settlements of Wistaria, Streatham, Ootsa and Marilla along the north shore of Ootsa Lake, was flooded out by Alcan’s Kemano project in the early 1950s. By looking back through the oral testimony of twenty-six former residents, this thesis examines how the settlers came to know, use and appreciate their environment in ways that defy conventional academic wisdom about non-aboriginal communities in northern British Columbia history. Such wisdom paints a picture of non-native sojourners who travel to the North in search of fortune and either succeed in the purpose or leave shortly thereafter in defeat. Yet the experience of the Ootsa Lake settlers suggests an altogether different story. These settlers quickly discarded any notions of economic grandeur an learned to adapt to their abundant, yet often harsh, environment. A strong dependence upon ths surrounding landscape coupled with extreme geographic isolation, brought about a subsistence/barter economy and a relative absence of wage labour and currency. Consequently, the Ootsa Lake settlers were able to build a viable, multi-generational community that survived largely outside of the boom and bust economic cycles that have haunted ‘company’ and resource-based towns in the provincial North. As such, the history of the Ootsa Lake settlements, long forgotten beneath the waters of the Nechako Reservoir, provides an insightful look into the development of northern British Columbian society.

AB  - "This thesis is the result of the research that was completed with Tl’azt’en Nation. Tl’azt’en Nation partnered with the University of Northern British Columbia to form a Community University Research Alliance (CURA). This CURA project funded by the Social Science and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRCC) allowed me to look at the benefits (positive) and impacts (negative) of tourism development for Tl’azt’en Nation and the issues surrounding the development of tourism in traditional Tl’azt’en territory. The research for this project was developed with the assistance of the Tl’azt’en community, and various social science techniques were employed to gather data with these community members. Techniques included: tourism presentations, workshops and semi-structured interviews. Data gathered from the community members led to the discovery of new themes and community feelings that were unexpected at the outset of the research. The research showed that Tl’azt’en Nation is in favor of tourism development, yet additional elements also emerged throughout the community members’ information sharing sessions. These alternate, unexpected elements showed that Tl’azt’en Nation community members are concerned about their culture, youth and elders. The work done in the community revealed that Tl’azt’en Nation is willing to develop tourism, but with the wish to protect and enhance their culture, youth and elders while doing so."

AU  - Rurik Muenter
AB  - "Community-based resource management has the fundamental goal to involve the community in decisions. The Community Forest Agreement is a new form of forest license which the province of British Columbia is granting to community organizations in order to enable community based resource management. Community forestry is becoming an increasingly popular and widely adopted model for the province to deal with conflict laden resource issues and for communities to gain some control over the management and benefits of local forests. It is assumed that the community forests will provide control over and benefits from the local forest to the local community. There remains important questions about the effectiveness of granting forest license to community organization evaluate how effective the mechanisms for achieving local control. This thesis investigates the effectiveness of public engagement in community forestry in an attempt to understand the issues of representation, influence, and public awareness. The goal of this research project is to evaluate how the public engagement mechanisms and programs of three community forests exhibit key criteria of effective public engagement established in the literature. The research thereby validates many of these criteria and provides insight into the issues facing community forests in their efforts to involve the local public."-

TY  - thesis
AU  - Peter Dawson
AB  - "In the nineteen fifties dozens of cases of relocation of Aboriginal peoples in Canada took place. According to the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples held between 1992 and 1996, these relocations were rationalised by the Canadian government on the basis of administrative or development purposes. The reports of the Commission demonstrate beyond doubt, that the relocations were undertaken without consultation with the people involved and indeed despite their resistance. They also reveal the holistically devastating impact of relocations on the lives and the lifestyle of the relocated peoples. The main argument put forward in this thesis is that relocation of Aboriginal people in Canada constitutes racial discrimination and a breach of Jus Cogens. Relocation, as a series of events, is a process of systematic human rights violations, justified by racist invalidation ideology which may, as in the two case studies presented, culminate in ethnocide (cultural genocide)."

TY  - thesis
AU  - Leona Shaw
AB  - "Aboriginal people, including Tl'azt'en Nation, have close and long-standing relationships with the environment. Plants were, and still are, important for food, medicine, and cultural purposes. Western societies have had a negative impact on many Aboriginal communities which can be seen in the loss of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). An examples of this is with TEK regarding food and medicine plant use of Tl'azt'en Nation. This research was a collaborative project between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). Tl'azt'en community members participated in every stage of the research and assisted in the determination of the research goals and objectives. This ensured that the appropriate knowledge was being documented and it was in a form that was presentable and acceptable to all involved. The study was conducted to collect TEK about the ecology of food and medicine plant gathering sites, to gain an understanding of the criteria for gathering individual plants for food or medicine use, to understand why traditional food and medicine plant gathering sites may fall out of use, and to provide information for a frame work for the protection measure that will be necessary for the continuation of plant gathering activities and sites. In order to gather TEK, fifteen plants were selected to focus on and a total of ten Tl'azt'enne, considered to be knowledgeable about food and medicine plants, participated in various meetings, focus groups, interviews, and field sessions and shared their knowledge about the fifteen plants and their gathering sites. Tl'azt'enne who use plants for food and medicine purposes do not seem to have specific sites where plants must be collected for these purposes, as long as the plant is available in an undisturbed area, away from people and in Tl'azt'en Territory, it can be gathered. Tl'azt'enne community members possess a deep understanding of plants and their gathering sites and have many concerns including the loss of TEK, changing landscapes, and ecological disturbances. Although Tl'azt'enne community members are concerned about the loss of TEK, they realize that TEK, like other knowledge systems, is adaptable. By having TEK recorded in "non-traditional" methods, such as in research projects like this, Tl'azt'enne are controlling the future and the preservation of their knowledge. The close interrelationship between Tl'azt'en Nation and their land must not be overlooked and researchers must respect indigenous people as keepers of TEK.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Domenico Santomauro
AB  - "Throughout the 1800s and the 1900s, woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) disappeared from the upper Nechako lowlands of the interior of British Columbia, and herds in the surrounding mountain ranges contracted. Conversely, moose (Alces alces) populations expanded during the 1900s and rapidly colonized former caribou habitat. Using historical-ecological methods of research and Geographic Information System (GIS) software, I documented caribou and moose historical distribution and abundance, and examined the causative mechanisms that led to caribou decline. I gathered historical information from four sources: 1) secondary literature; 2) semi-structured interviews with aboriginal and non-aboriginal elders; 3) journals of the Hudson's Bay Company of Fort St. James; 4) other written primary sources. The findings of this study provide evidence of greater historical distribution and abundance of caribou, and confirm the value of Traditional Ecological Knowledge of First Nations (TEK) and of long-term historical perspectives for the study of ecological changes over time."

AB  - The ecological disturbance from wildfire (2004) on ~10,000 hectares of forests near the Kenny Dam presented a unique opportunity to study the natural and artificial regeneration in burned mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins) infested stands in north-central British Columbia. Mountain pine beetle (MPB) has been documented as a natural disturbance agent that may precede wildfire in lodgepole pine forests (Pinus contorta var. latifolia). The objectives of this thesis were to i) characterize lodgepole pine regeneration and related micro-site conditions associated with wildfire, ii) identify limitations for germination, survival and recruitment of natural and artificial regeneration in relation to site moisture, fire severity, and vegetative competition, and iii) provide guidance on local operational management of MPB-killed stands.

AU  - Nechako Environmental & Water Stewardship Society
AB  - In the fall of 2013 the Department of Fisheries and Oceans funded the Nechako Environment and Water Stewardship Society (NEWSS) to initiate a watershed health assessment in the Stoney Creek watershed. Work on this project in began in October 2013 by initially identifying 9 crossings that may potential be barriers to fish. Of these 9 crossings, 6 were culverts and were assessed using the guidelines from the BC Ministry of Environment’s “Field Assessment for Determining FishPassage Status of Closed Bottom Structures”. Of the 6 culverts assessed, 4 were considered to be barriers to fish passage, and 2 were assessed tobe potential barriers to fish passage.Additional GIS analysis identified a total of 49 crossings in the watershed. The majority of these sites are believed to be closed bottom culverts, some crossing sites do however appear to be livestock watering and crossing locations, and through stream vehicular crossings. Future work will include assessing the remaining 40 crossings for fish passage and erosion issues. A total of 353 riparian buffers in the Stoney Creek watershed were analyzed. Seventy seven (77) riparian buffers were identified as problematic meaning that out of a total of 20 possible points used in the analysis, these sites only scored between 5 and 8 total points. These are riparian buffers that are in need of improved management practices, and are likely to need some restoration projects to restore functionality. Another 10 riparian buffers were identified as unhealthy this means that out of a total of 20 possible points used in the analysis, these sites scored less than 5 points. These are riparian buffers that have a high probability of needing restoration work and improved management practices to restore functionality. Future shouldinclude developing relationships with landowners, initiating and develop prescriptions for restoration projects in riparian buffers, suggesting improved management practices in and around streams, and begin carrying out restorationprojects in identified riparian buffers andstreams.

AB  - Guided by decolonizing methodologies and ecosystem approaches to health, this thesis explores Saik’uz First Nation (SFN) youth perspectives about the connections between land, health and well-being. The project engaged a small group of youth (ages 14-27) in a modified Photovoice project, embedded within a qualitative study. Their experience and photos were discussed through the Indigenous method of sharing circles, guided by two Elders, followed by semi-structured interviews. The research process was developed with a community research advisor designated by the Chief and Council. Qualitative data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Four themes emerged that represented how these SFN youth saw the land, health and well-being as connected and relational. Additionally, the youth described two main drivers of change that were impacting these relationships. The youth and Elders’ insights have provided fertile ground for ideas about how to progress ecohealth and First Nations health throughout the Northern BC landscape.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Leana Garraway
AB  - "Knowledge translation is the sharing of knowledge in an effort to make research more meaningful to society. Currently, many gaps exist in effective knowledge to action especially for research carried out with Aboriginal peoples. My master’s research explores knowledge transaction and knowledge to action in regards to recent research initiatives in, and for, the Takla Lake First Nation (TLFN). Using content analysis based on focus group interviews with 17 community participants, I was interested to see if community members’ expectations of the research process had been met, and to hear from community members themselves about strategies and approaches they wanted taken to translate knowledge obtained from research into actions. This thesis research finds that a better understanding of the context and ways of knowing of a group is necessary to undertake effective research and knowledge translation activities. Also, there is a need for more defined and established evaluation criteria and techniques for Aboriginal knowledge translation. Finally, I argue that the TLFN want future actions in the community to derive from strength-based approaches based in the traditional TLFN culture as a method to improve community unity, health and wellbeing."

AB  - The Southside Health & Wellness Centre embraces all that is positive about a vision of sustainable change. It is a healing centre that is client focused and community minded. It is also a five-year success story which began when First Nations leaders in the area known as southside [Francois Lake, 225 km. west of Prince George, BC] envisioned an expanded health and wellness centre for all residents Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal -- in this remote region in northern British Columbia. Sustainable change for BCs Northern Health Authority comes, in part, with Care North focused on enhancing the way primary health care services are delivered in the northern part of British Columbia. The Care North vision encompasses a health care system founded in primary care and community, where every resident has a primary care home, providing access and comprehensive, coordinated care. Care North develops multidisciplinary professional teams to establish long-term healing relationships with patients and to help northerners both manage their health and build healthier communities.

AB  - In 2004 and 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions on Aboriginal consultation set in motion significant changes to Aboriginal-Crown interactions and relations. In 2010, the Court had three opportunities to add greater texture to the duty to consult. In the result, the Court confirmed that the long-term objective of reconciliation is to foster the ability of Aboriginal communities to participate within the mainstream legal system “with its advantages of continuity, transparency, and predictability”. The approaches to this fundamental conclusion by Binnie and Deschamps JJ., however, exposed some significant differences in perspective and raise some deeper questions about the objectives of dialogue and reconciliation. The paper asks whether in the Court’s view reconciliation and dialogue is intended to make some room for Aboriginal participation in Canada’s overall socio-economic growth, or whether it is intended to promote a more profound constitutional restructuring of the Crown-Aboriginal relationship.

TY  - web
AU  - Poulton, T.L.
AB  - Creek M is a short, high-gradient creek located on the south side of Tahtsa Reach in Ootsa Lake (Nechako Reservoir) near Houston, British Columbia. This creek was barren of fish until 1996, when Huckleberry Mines Ltd. implemented a habitat-compensation plan to offset prospective losses of fish habitat associated with mine development. The goal of this plan was to allow upstream passage of fish from Tahtsa Reach throughout the creek to a headwater pond located approximately 425 metres (m) upstream. Compensation structures within the creek consisted of three fishways comprised of log-steps (i.e., weirs) lined with geotextile and anchored with rock fill. Annual fish surveys documented the failure over time of many log-step structures, precluding fish passage. In 2012 and 2013, remedial works were undertaken to re-establish upstream fish passage for juvenile and adult rainbow trout in Creek M. New fishways were designed to be more robust, to function over a range of flows, and to meet specific requirements of migrating rainbow trout.

TI  - 3D inversion modelling of the Nechako Basin, British Columbia, magnetotelluric data set
TY  - thesis
AU  - Drew, Matthew Charles
AB  - The Nechako Basin is an intermontane basin situated in south central British Columbia, Canada. Due to a desire for an alternative source of employment stemming from the impact of the mountain pine beetle on the forestry industry, the government of British Columbia has commissioned several geophysical and geological surveys of the area in order to assess its hydrocarbon potential. This sedimentary basin is covered with a layer of volcanic extrusive rocks which renders seismic methods nearly ineffective. As an alternative, a magnetotelluric (MT) survey was performed in order to determine subsurface conductivity and structure. Data from this survey were used in this thesis to produce a 3D conductivity model of the subsurface, by running multiple inversions with varied parameters. Data from four profiles as well as additional sites filling in gaps between profiles were used: Profile A ran west of Nazko. Profile B ran south of Nazko, Profile C ran north-west of Nazko, and Profile D ran east from Nazko toward Quesnel. Models from inversion of this MT survey show sensitivity to thicker surface volcanic rock and show where these bodies may thin or pinch out (e.g. conductivity at the west end of profile A and south end of Profile B). Additionally potential faulting and partial melt is seen in the subsurface, in profile D and at depth between profiles A and C respectively. 3D inversion models have provided information in addition to previous 2D results, giving a different placement of features out of the restricted plane of 2D inversion and showing lateral extent of conductivity anomalies, thus contributing to hydrocarbon exploration in the Nechako Basin.

The theoretical and methodological ideas behind the book, inspired by Aristotelian phronesis, represent an original perspective within the social sciences, and this volume gives readers for the first time a set of studies exemplifying what applied phronesis looks like in practice. The reflexive analysis of values and power gives new meaning to the impact of research on policy and practice. Real Social Science is a major step forward in a novel and thriving field of research. This book will benefit scholars, researchers and students who want to make a difference in practice, not just in the academy. Its message will make it essential reading for students and academics across the social sciences.

AB  - Many people today believe that ethnocultural politics in Canada are spiralling out of control, with ever more groups in society making ever greater demands. Finding Our Way offers a more balanced view Will Kymlicka argues that the difficulties involved in accommodating ethnocultural diversity are not insurmountable, and that Canadians have an impressive range of experience and resources on which to draw in addressing them. A crucial part of his argument is the distinction between the ethnic groups formed by immigration and the 'nations within' constituted by the Quebecois and Aboriginal peoples, whose existence pre-dates that of the Canadian state. With respect to immigrant groups, he maintains that the 'multicultural' model of integration adopted by the federal government in 1971 has worked much better than is commonly thought, and can be adapted to new circumstances.

AB  - he environmental and social dynamics of resource development pose challenges for health research, policy, and practice, due the need to understand and respond to multiple interacting stressors and processes that can impact on human health and well-being over space and time. Cumulative health impacts can, therefore, be usefully understood as part of ongoing efforts to address the combined social and environmental determinants of health. This Chapter begins with an overview of the range of prospective, reactive, and integrative approaches that inform Canadian and global approaches to assessing health impact. It then highlights key considerations relevant to understanding the health impacts of resource development in rural, remote, and resource-dependent communities by drawing on exemplars and experiences within northern BC, Canada. The Chapter concludes by discussing the examples from northern BC in relation to a cascade of direct and indirect impacts on social and environmental determinants of health. The interface between impact assessment and the determinants of health is an important challenge in its own right, but is especially important in the context of the environmental, community, and health impacts of resource development. Combining these issues and perspective provides a more integrated view of the cumulative determinants of health impacts.

AB  - While previous chapters in this book explored the many challenges posed by cumulative impacts relative to the environment, communities, and human health and well-being, our goal is to develop a common framework for examining cumulative effects and impacts that is inclusive of those perspectives. Therefore, specific on-the-ground examples can be helpful to better understand the complexities, tensions, and interactions among cumulative impacts and foster more integrative approaches to addressing these. To that end, this Chapter includes eight vignettes that help to illustrate recurrent messages about the failure of current thinking and approaches, and why we must develop a more inclusive perspective and ultimately integrative process for addressing cumulative impacts. Topics covered include determining the necessary spatial and temporal scale for examining cumulative impacts, identifying important ecological and human values before development takes place, and making the integration among potential ecological, economic, community, recreational, and health considerations and consequences more explicit. Together, the vignettes highlight why current assessment approaches are ineffective and they build the argument for a needed dramatic shift in how we consider cumulative impacts.

AB  - While the federal government has steadily lightened its regulatory role over aspects of federal jurisdiction that influence provincial water management, this jurisdictional space has provided opportunities for sub-national arrangements that address environmental protection. First Nations, provincial and local governments are creating collaborative ecosystem-based management regulations and initiatives that respond to the ecological governance imperatives of planning at a watershed scale, protecting environmental flows, linking decisions about land and water, and adaptive management. Ecological monitoring, watershed-scale planning, decision-making resulting from treaties, protection of riparian areas and watersheds, and water law reform in the west all feature prominently in these sub-national approaches. Any federal action in the future that affects water will be challenged to support these appropriately scaled regulations and decision-making.

AB  - The Provincial Norths in Canada are among the most marginalized, externally controlled and impoverished regions in the country, a reality largely obscured by the country’s long-time preoccupation with conditions in the Territorial North. Canada may see a new Provincial North in the years to come, but substantial progress requires the willingness and ability of provincial governments to adapt their policies, administrative systems, and expectations to northern needs. In this article, the authors review the governance structures and regional operations of the Canadian Provincial Norths including British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Quebec. Particular attention is placed on administrative structures, departmental identity and autonomy, connection to the broader government structures, and governance legislation. The information is provided on a province-by-province basis, as arrangements vary substantially across the country. The governance systems for the northern parts of the provinces have shifted considerably over time, as south-centred provincial governments wrestle with the challenges of balancing northern interests with the province-wide supports for aggressive resource development.

AB  - Northern British Columbia has always played an important role in Canada's economy, but for many Canadians it also existed as an almost forgotten place: a vast territory where only a few roads, some railroad tracks, and a ferry system connected small cities, towns, and villages to the outside world. Now, as the global appetite for oil, gas, hydroelectricity, wood, and minerals intensifies, this resource-rich and geographically important region is being pulled onto the national and international economic stages. As debates around pipelines, mines, and hydroelectric projects intensify in local coffee shops, distant boardrooms, and the halls of Parliament, this timely volume examines the connections and tensions between resource communities and global market forces, illuminating how governments, Aboriginal peoples, organized labour, NGOs, and the private sector are adapting to, resisting, and embracing change.

TI  - Acoustic and adsorption properties of submerged wood
TY  - thesis
AU  - Hilde, Calvin Patrick
AB  - Wood is a common material for the manufacture of many products. Submerged wood, in particular, is used in niche markets, such as the creation of musical instruments. An initial study performed on submerged wood from Ootsa Lake, British Columbia, provided results that showed that the wood was not suitable for musical instruments. This thesis re-examined the submerged wood samples. After allowing the wood to age unabated in a laboratory setting, the wood was retested under the hypothesis that the physical acoustic characteristics would improve. It was shown, however, that the acoustic properties became less adequate after being left to sit. The adsorption properties of the submerged wood were examined to show that the submerged wood had a larger accessible area of wood than that of control wood samples. This implied a lower amount of crystalline area within the submerged wood. From the combined adsorption and acoustic data for the submerged wood, relationships between the moisture content and speed of sound were created and combined with previous research to create a proposed model to describe how the speed of sound varies with temperature, moisture content and the moisture content corresponding to complete hydration of sorption sites within the wood.

AB  - Ten-year response of plant communities to disk trenching, plowing, rotoclearing and windrow burning was studied on two contrasting sites to address concerns that mechanical site preparation reduces structural and species diversity. Cover and height of all species on randomly located subplots within 0.05- to 0.075-ha treatment plots were used to develop indices of volume, structural diversity, and species diversity; to ordinate the plots; and to correlate species diversity with crop-tree performance. At both sites, community response was strongly influenced by the severity of site preparation. On a boreal site dominated by willow (Salix L. spp.), green alder (Alnus crispa (Ait.) Pursh ssp. crispa) and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), site preparation increased structural diversity and had little effect on species diversity. High-severity treatments increased non-native species abundance 10- to 16-fold while only marginally enhancing growth of planted white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) over medium-severity treatments. On a nutrient-poor sub-boreal site, species diversity declined with increasing treatment severity and with increasing lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) stem volume. Velvet-leaved blueberry (Vaccinium myrtilloides Michx.) was highly sensitive to mechanical disturbance. Moderate mechanical treatments appear to improve conifer performance while causing little change to plant communities, but high severity treatments can cause substantial change.

AB  - The purpose of this work is to develop a better understanding and thinking about the cumulative impacts of multiple natural resource development projects. Cumulative impacts are now one of the most pressing, but complex challenges facing governments, industry, communities, and conservation and natural resource professionals. There has been technical and policy research exploring how cumulative environmental impacts can be assessed and managed. These studies, however, have failed to consider the necessary integration of community, environment and health. Informed by knowledge and experience in northern British Columbia, this book seeks to expand our understanding of the cumulative impacts of natural resource development through an integrated lens. The book offers a timely response to a growing imperative – proposing integrative response to multiple natural resource developments in a way that addresses converging environment, community and health issues. Informed by the editors’ experiences across several complementary areas of expertise, we envision this book as appealing to a wide range of researchers, educators and practitioners, with relevance to a growing audience with appetite for and interest in integrative approaches.

AB  - Initial long term planning for logging on the Tweedsmuir-Entiako caribou winter range began in the early 1980s. Because little information was available on which to base winter range management, the British Columbia Fish and Wildlife Branch began studies on radio-collared caribou in 1983, and an intensive study on caribou winter habitat requirements was conducted from 1985 to 1988. Terrestrial lichens were identified as the primary winter food source for the caribou, and in 1987, caribou winter range ecosystem maps, which emphasized abundance of terrestrial lichens, were produced. The ecosystem maps and information from the caribou study, including potential direct and indirect effects of timber harvesting on the caribou population, were used to develop a management strategy for the winter range. The management strategy comprised two levels of management: a landscape level (Caribou Management Zones); and a site-specific level (caribou habitat/timber values). Timber information associated with BC Ministry of Forests forest cover maps was integrated using a Geographic Information System. Six winter range management options were proposed ranging from harvesting low value caribou habitats only throughout the winter range to total protection of the entire winter range. Impacts of those options on both the caribou population and on the timber supply were evaluated. The options were reviewed through a public planning process, the Entiako Local Resource Use Plan, and recommendations from that process were forwarded to the British Columbia Protected Areas Strategy.

AB  - Alcan says it won't halt work on its $1 billion hydroelectric project on the Nechako River system in northwest B.C. despite a Federal Court of Canada ruling Thursday that requires an assessment of its environmental impact.The native Indian and environmental groups which launched the court action had called on Alcan to stop construction, but the Vancouver lawyer who represented them confirmed today it is legal for Alcan to refuse.Waters that naturally flowed into the Fraser River were diverted west through a mountain tunnel to a huge hydroelectric complex at Kemano, to provide cheap, abundant power for Alcan's aluminum smelter at Kitimat.

AU  - Loo, Tina
VL  - 97

SN  - 0008-3755
AB  - Seeing Like a State (1998), anthropologist James C. Scott's critique of twentieth-century development and the ideology of “high modernism” that animates it, has shaped the writing of Canadian history, as it has in so many other fields. Environmental historians of Canada, particularly those who study hydroelectric development in the postwar period, have found it especially useful because it links social and environmental change to political power, putting nature at the core of the project of modernization. This article reviews some of that literature to illustrate and critique Scott's key concepts and arguments. Specifically, it takes issue with Scott's contention that high modernist development pitted local knowledge against the expertise of the state's agents. The article also challenges the declensionist narrative offered in the book, which portrays the nature of high modernist change solely in terms of degradation. Finally, it suggests that adopting the very way of seeing that Scott criticizes – an imperial, encompassing, reductive vision – has, and can hold out, the promise for a better kind of development.

AB  - There is no safe concentration of radon gas, but guideline values provide threshold concentrations that are used to map areas at higher risk. These values vary between different regions, countries, and organizations, which can lead to differential classification of risk. For example the World Health Organization suggests a 100 Bq m−3value, while Health Canada recommends 200 Bq m−3. Our objective was to describe how different thresholds characterized ecological radon risk and their visual association with lung cancer mortality trends in British Columbia, Canada.

TI  - Wildfire Management in the Southside Region of Canada’s Montane Cordillera - A Systems Modelling Application on Firebreak Strategies
TY  - thesis
AU  - Kessels, Henricus
AB  - There is growing recognition of the importance of preserving Canada’s forests. Canada’s 348 million hectares of forest land cover 35% of its land area, representing 9% of the world’s forests and 24% of the world’s boreal forests. As a renewable resource, forests offer significant environmental, economic and recreational benefits and innumerable services contributing to the quality of life.Canada has recently entered an era of increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Ecosystems and communities especially in western Canada have recently undergone a trend of increasing pressures from natural disturbances. These disturbances include wildfires associated with increased fuel load levels from past fire suppression regimes and a widely spread infestation of the mountain pine beetle in addition to changes in weather patterns. Wildfire activity has reached extreme levels in many of the recent years.This thesis profiles an area of western Canada within the Montane Cordillera covering the Nechako Lakes Electoral District in central British Columbia and assesses its vulnerability to the specific hazard of wildfires caused by natural and man-made sources. The objectives of this research are to review, simulate and assess the impact of various fuel management strategies in a sub-section of the Nechako Lakes Electoral District called the Southside. Values at risk include private property and old growth forest in respectively timber supply areas, provincial parks, woodlots and community forests.Simulation results show that firebreaks are effective in significantly reducing the area burned in different parts of the landscape. The performance of different strategies shows large variation. Although this has not been investigated further, such variation has likely been caused by topographic aspects and the positioning of firebreaks in the landscape in relation to climatic parameters. These results can therefore not be extrapolated beyond the simulated area, but do give an indication of the performance variation that may be expected when similar firebreaks are applied elsewhere. The results also show that model performance of all firebreak strategies is heavily and fairly consistently influenced by weather stream parameters. Sensitivity analyses of weather stream parameters show that although the reduction in total area burned varies, the ranking between strategies in their overall performance is consistent regardless of the weather pattern. Combined dry, warm and windy weather conditions lead to a 3.44-fold increase in total area burned as compared to the scenario with average weather conditions. In favourable weather conditions represented by wet, cold and nearly windless conditions, the model shows an 85% reduction in total burned area as compared to the average scenario. These results illustrate the significant impact of uncontrollable variables on the overall result.

AB  - The foundation of archival methodology is influenced by colonialism and imperialism. This paternalistic system has created a hegemonic environment that has directly influenced archivists working with Indigenous materials. While positive steps have been made, such as the enactment of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990) and the Protocols for NativeAmerican Archival Materials (2006), severe limitations exist due to a difference in worldview and cultural beliefs. In order to reverse the effects of hegemony and decolonize archival methodology, an exerted effort must be made to increase collaboration between archives and Indigenous communities. Furthermore, higher education must attract Indigenous students to information science programs in order to create a more diverse workforce. However, in order to enact lasting change in methodology, the archival profession must receive an injection of activist principles. These principles will help advance decolonizing initiatives and ensure the end of paternalism and colonialism in archival science.

TI  - Saws, sonar and submersibles: Expectations of/for underwater logging
TY  - web
AU  - Randalls, Samuel
AU  - Petrokofsky, Gillian
AB  - Underwater logging is a relatively novel industry focused on extracting wood from standing trees in deep-water lakes and reservoirs. It emerges through a confluence of technological, financial and environmental interests, primarily within small corporations in British Columbia, Canada. Companies now operate in many countries worldwide and may be promoted by dam owners that are moving from a narrow focus on hydroelectric power revenue to exploring ways of extracting profit from these infrastructures. In this paper we use the example of underwater logging to explore the ways in which expectations for new industries create value for these companies. We show how uncertainty, materiality and control of the storyline become three formative factors in explaining why some expectations are realized while others fail. First, uncertainty can be made to be economically productive as long as it is bounded by methodologically reliable accounting. In the case of underwater logging, while unknown timber quantities could be economically damaging, rare, unknown wood is translated into a niche, high-end market that creates additional value. Second, materiality is at the heart of expectations in that companies need to show they have control over the raw materials and ecological consequences of the logging. Third, controlling the storyline becomes a vital part of marketing underwater wood. This produces a somewhat cautious reaction to certification schemes and retailers. The performative nature of expectations thus needs to be considered in explorations of the production of capitalist natures and the consequences of these interventions.

AB  - Contaminated water is a problem of global concern that disproportionately affects many Indigenous communities. This study focuses on water-quality issues facing two Indigenous communities - the Altaian people of Central Siberia, and the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation of Northeastern Kansas. Information was collected about each community's water resources and cultural attitudes towards them through a series of interviews and quantitative water-quality tests. Results revealed similar attitudes and reverence for water resources in both communities, and that both communities have defined protocols for their interactions with water resources. Each community is facing threats to their water quality from different sources of pollution, and may benefit from a community-based water-quality monitoring program to better inform them of their water quality.

AB  - Nechako white sturgeon are experiencing a recruitment failure, which has been attributed to the failure of eggs and larvae to survive as a resultof changes in the substrate at the locations where they are known tospawn. As part of the overall recovery effort initiative, cobblesubstrate was placed at two locations to provide clean spawningsubstrate. Subsequently, the condition of the substrate has beeninvestigated using an underwater camera and freeze core sampling. Theseobservations have shown that coarse sand and fine gravels (fine bedoad)have in-filled the coarse substrate where it was placed along the insidecorner of the bends, while placed substrate located on the outside ofthe bends has remained free of this size fraction. This observation haslead to the quandary: Is placed cobble substrate on the outside cornerof the bends not being filled in with fine bedload because fine bedloadis not moving past these sites, or are post-regulation flood flowssufficient to ensure fines remain suspended and are not deposited in theinterstitial spaces? To assess this question a number of field basedtechniques will be used in August of 2013 during high flows to examinethe movement of fine bedload. The techniques employed will include anunderwater camera, P61 suspended sediment sampler, a HellySmith andKAROLYI bedload sampler and an ADCP with RTK for bottom tracking. Theintent is to examine the movement of fine bedload across the channel ata number of potential spawning sites. The poster will summarize theobservations to date about the movement of fine bedload at the spawningsites, and discuss the implications for spawning substrate improvementefforts.

AB  - Effects of two fin-ray sampling methods on swimming performance, growth and survival were evaluated for hatchery-reared sub-adult white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus. Fish were subjected to either a notch removal treatment in which a small section was removed from an anterior marginal pectoral-fin ray, or a full removal treatment in which an entire marginal pectoral-fin ray was removed. Control fish did not have fin rays removed, but they were subjected to a sham operation. A modified 3230 l Brett-type swim tunnel was used to evaluate 10 min critical station-holding speeds (SCSH) of A. transmontanus, immediately after the fin ray biopsies were obtained with each method. Survival and growth were evaluated over a 6 month period for a separate group of fish subjected to the same biopsy methods. Mean ± s.e. 10 min SCSH were 108·0 ± 2·3, 110·0 ± 2·6 and 115·0 ± 3·5 cm s−1 for the notch removal group, full removal group and control group, respectively, and were not significantly different among treatments. Behavioural characteristics including tail-beat frequency and time spent hunkering were also not significantly different among treatment groups swimming at the same speeds. There were no mortalities and relative growth was similar among treatment groups. Average biopsy time for the notch removal method was lower and the wounds appeared to heal more quickly compared with the full removal method.

AB  - This paper presents results of a passive-source seismic mapping study in the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of central British Columbia, with the ultimate goal of contributing to assessments of hydrocarbon and mineral potential of the region. For the present study, an array of nine seismic stations was deployed in 2006-2007 to sample a wide area of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau. The specific goal was to map the thickness of the sediments and volcanic cover, and the overall crustal thickness and structural geometry beneath the study area. This study utilizes recordings of about 40 distant earthquakes from 2006 to 2008 to calculate receiver functions, and constructs S-wave velocity models for each station using the Neighbourhood Algorithm inversion. The surface sediments are found to range in thickness from about 0.8 to 2.7 km, and the underlying volcanic layer from 1.8 to 4.7 km. Both sediments and volcanic cover are thickest in the central portion of the study area. The crustal thickness ranges from 22 to 36 km, with an average crustal thickness of about 30-34 km. A consistent feature observed in this study is a low-velocity zone at the base of the crust. This study complements other recent studies in this area, including active-source seismic studies and magnetotelluric measurements, by providing site-specific images of the crustal structure down to the Moho and detailed constraints on the S-wave velocity structure.

AB  - Recent Canadian court decisions have scrutinized the way in which governments, when their actions or decisions may infringe on Aboriginal or treaty rights, consult with potentially affected Aboriginal people. Consultation is a key consideration in the justification analysis developed by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Sparrow decision to determine whether government is justified in infringing those rights. This paper contrasts the type of consultation that often prevails in practice with the duty to consult emerging from the case law.

TI  - Diagnosing causes of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) recruitment failure and the importance of substrate condition to yolksac larvae survival
TY  - thesis
AU  - McAdam, Donald Steven Osborne
AB  - White sturgeon are a conservation concern throughout their range, and three populations in Canada are experiencing nearly zero recruitment. While the presence of large dams on the Nechako, upper Columbia and Kootenay rivers suggests a causal relationship between flow regulation and recruitment failure, persistent uncertainty regarding the species’ biology and its interaction with anthropogenic habitat change limits the understanding of the causal mechanisms of recruitment failure. Recruitment failure causation in the Nechako and upper Columbia rivers was evaluated by comparing hindcasted recruitment with historical environmental changes. For the Nechako River population, recruitment failure coincided with substrate changes at a known spawning site; these changes were identified based on air photos and changes in river bed elevation. Evaluation of the upper Columbia River population considered the effects of multiple dams and other anthropogenic impacts, as well as the effects of sturgeon aging error and population structure. Eleven recruitment failure hypotheses were evaluated based on fifteen criteria, including stock specific temporal and spatial patterns of recruitment decline. Estimated timing of stock-specific recruitment declines was also compared with reach and watershed scale environmental changes and site-specific habitat changes. For both analyses, substrate change at spawning sites was identified as the likely cause of recruitment failure. Embryos and yolksac larvae are expected to be the primary life stages affected in both cases. Laboratory and field enclosure studies assessed the effects of substrate on drift, hiding and survival of yolksac larvae. Contrary to many prior investigations, interstitial hiding was the predominant behaviour in laboratory studies in the presence of suitable interstitial habitat, and both drift and predation by sculpins (Cottus spp.) increased when interstitial habitat was unavailable. Rapid and sustained hiding by yolksac larvae and increased survival all suggest that hiding predominantly occurs in the vicinity of spawning habitat. Collectively my results indicate that recruitment failure results from increased early life history mortality in response to substrate changes at spawning sites. Increased survival of yolksac larvae in response to gravel augmentation in field studies suggests that larger-scale substrate restoration at spawning sites provides a habitat based approach for recruitment restoration.

AB  - Palynological analyses of both host rock and orebody samples from three separate mining properties have yielded significant information on ages as well as paleotemperature and paleodepositional regimes. The structural setting of the southernmost, a silver deposit in north-central Mexico is complex; palynological dating of pollen, spores, and dinoflagellates show that rocks of Upper Cretaceous age are thrust over the Mid Cretaceous orebody, both of which are thrust over Upper Jurassic rocks. The second is a gold property from the overthrust belt of southwestern Montana containing a Paleocene rather than a Precambrian palynoassemblage resulting in an unexpected and therefore controversial age. The third is a gold property from sedimentary rocks in the Tintinna trench in south-central Yukon containing a typical Mid Eocene assemblage. Of significance in all three sites are paleotemperature data that indicate at least 270°C, and probably well above 300°C. Such high temperatures carbonized the palynomorphs and required the development of a new processing technique, referred to here as the “extended Schulze's technique”. This application of palynology is gaining interest among mining geologists and engineers to help distinguish hypo- and supergene orebodies, as well as to reconstruct depositional patterns.

AB  - Objectives: Mainstream environmental assessment (EA) methodologies often inadequately address health, social and cultural impacts of concern for Canadian indigenous communities affected by industrialization. Our objective is to present a holistic, culturally-appropriate framework for the selection of indigenous health indicators for baseline health assessment, impact prediction, or monitoring of impacts over time. Methods: We used a critical population health approach to explore the determinants of health and health inequities in indigenous communities and conceptualize the pathways by which industrialization affects these determinants. We integrated and extended key elements from three indigenous health frameworks into a new holistic model for the selection of indigenous EA indicators. Results: The holistic model conceptualizes individual and community determinants of health within external social, economic and political contexts and thus provides a comprehensive framework for selecting indicators of indigenous health. Indigenous health is the product of interactions among multiple determinants of health and contexts. Potential applications are discussed using case study examples involving indigenous communities affected by industrialization. Conclusion: Industrialization can worsen indigenous health inequities by perpetuating the health, social and cultural impacts of historic environmental dispossession. To mitigate impacts, EA should explicitly recognize linkages between environmental dispossession and the determinants of health and health inequities and meaningfully involve indigenous communities in the process. Objectifs : Souvent, les méthodes d'évaluation environnementale (EE) ordinaires n'abordent pas suffisamment les impacts sanitaires, sociaux et culturels de l'industrialisation sur les populations indigènes du Canada. Nous avons voulu présenter un cadre holistique, adapté aux différences culturelles, pouvant servir à sélectionner des indicateurs de santé indigène qui se prêtent 1) à l'évaluation de l'état de santé de départ, 2) à la prédiction des impacts et 3) à la surveillance de ces impacts au fil du temps. Méthode : Au moyen d'une approche critique de santé des populations, nous avons analysé les déterminants de la santé et les iniquités en santé dans des populations indigènes et conceptualisé les voies par lesquelles l'industrialisation influence ces déterminants. Nous avons intégré et généralisé les éléments clés de trois cadres de santé indigène afin de créer un nouveau modèle holistique de sélection d'indicateurs indigènes pour les EE. Résultats : Notre modèle holistique conceptualise les déterminants individuels et collectifs de la santé en tenant compte des contextes sociaux, économiques et politiques externes, ce qui donne un cadre global pour la sélection d'indicateurs de la santé indigène. La santé indigène est le produit des interactions entre de multiples contextes et déterminants de la santé. Les applications possibles du modèle sont abordées à l'aide d'études de cas impliquant des populations indigènes touchées par l'industrialisation. Conclusion : L'industrialisation peut aggraver les iniquités en santé vécues par les populations indigènes en perpétuant les impacts sanitaires, sociaux et culturels de la dépossession historique de leur environnement. Pour atténuer ces impacts, une EE doit explicitement reconnaître les liens entre la dépossession environnementale, les déterminants de la santé et les iniquités en santé et impliquer concrètement les populations indigènes dans le processus.

AB  - The pejorative use of Aboriginal imagery in professional and amateur sport has been criticized by Native Americans, public activists and academics from various disciplinary backgrounds. They have campaigned successfully to convince sport organizations to rid themselves of such slanderous signification. While sensitive to these activist and academic strategies such perspectives do not seriously take into account that many First Nations peoples and sport teams in Canada display these images in a variety of ways. The proliferation of these images in First Nations contexts motivated me to examine the issue of Native American sport imagery further, in particular how their use by First Nations peoples may problematize standard oppositional discourse that dominates academic literature on the subject. Through my interaction with these context specific uses of such imagery, I have come to formulate a reading that encourages the proliferation of these images, a call for their saturation in the sport and fashion industry. It is only then that their signifying potential of a reality that never was can be erased, giving way to new systems of meanings.

AB  - New mapping, mineralogical, and geochemical studies help characterize late Tertiary primitive, alkaline, sodic basanite, alkali olivine basalt, transitional basalt, and diabase in the Nechako River, Whitesail Lake, and McLeod Lake map areas of central British Columbia and distinguish the Miocene Cheslatta Lake suite. The suite encompasses scattered erosional remnants of topographically distinct, columnar-jointed, olivine-phyric basalt and diabase volcanic necks, dykes, and associated lava flows north of the Anahim volcanic belt and west of the Pinchi Fault. Volcanic centres at Alasla Mountain and at Cutoff Creek, near Cheslatta Lake, are proposed as type areas. Olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene phenocrysts, megacrysts, and (or) xenocrysts; common ultramafic xenoliths; and rare but significant plutonic and metamorphic xenoliths are characteristic. Basanite, transitional basalt, and alkali olivine basalt groundmass contain plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, feldspathoid, olivine, and apatite. The Cheslatta Lake suite is characterized by its alkaline character, olivine-rich (>10 wt.%) normative mineralogy, and silica-undersaturated nature (>1 wt.% normative nepheline; hypersthene-normative rocks are uncommon). Mg numbers vary between 72–42. Some samples encompass near-primitive mantle melt compositions. Cheslatta Lake suite rocks in the Nechako River area are distinguished from the underlying Eocene Endako and stratigraphically higher Neogene Chilcotin groups basaltic andesite lavas within the study area, and from the Chilcotin Group basalt in the type area south of the Anahim volcanic belt, by form, preserved thickness, phenocryst–xenocryst mineralogy, amygdule abundance, included xenoliths, isotopic age, and major and incompatible, high field strength, and rare-earth trace element contents. Une nouvelle cartographie et de nouvelles études minéralogiques et géochimiques aident à caractériser la basanite sodique, alcaline et primitive du Tertiaire tardif, le basalte alcalin à olivine, le basalte de transition et la diabase dans les régions cartographiques de la rivière Nechako et des lacs Whitesail et McLeod du centre de la Colombie-Britannique et aident à distinguer la suite de Cheslatta Lake, datant du Miocène. La suite comprend des lambeaux épars de l'érosion de roches topographiquement distinctes et à structure prismée; ces roches comprennent des basaltes à olivine porphyrique, des «necks» de diabase volcanique, des dykes et des coulées de lave associées, au nord de la ceinture volcanique Anahim et à l'ouest de la faille Pinchi. Nous proposons les centres volcaniques du mont Alasla et du ruisseau Cutoff, près du lac Cheslatta, comme régions types. Les roches suivantes sont caractéristiques des phénocristaux, des mégacristaux et (ou) des xénocristaux d'olivine, de plagioclase et de pyroxène; des xénolites ultramafiques communs et de rares mais significatifs xénolites plutoniques et métamorphiques. La matrice rocheuse de basanite, de basalte de transition et de basalte alcalin à olivine comprend du plagioclase, du clinopyroxène, des oxydes de Fe–Ti, des feldspathoïdes, de l'olivine et de l'apatite. La suite de Cheslatta Lake est caractérisée par son caractère alcalin, sa minéralogie normative riche en olivine (>10% en poids) et sa sous-saturation en silice (les roches à > 1% en poids de néphéline normative, hypersthène normatif sont peu communes). Les nombres pour le Mg varient entre 72 et 42. Quelques échantillons présentent des compositions du manteau quasi-primitif en fusion. Dans la région de la rivière Nechako, les roches de la suite de Cheslatta Lake se distinguent des roches sous-jacentes Endako, datant de l'Éocène, et des laves basaltiques à andésite des groupes Chilcotin, datant du Néogène, stratigraphiquement plus hautes ainsi que du basalte du Groupe Chilcotin dans la région type au sud de la ceinture volcanique Anahim par les points suivants la forme, la conservation de l'épaisseur, la minéralogie des phénocristaux–xénocristaux, l'abondance d'éléments amygdaloïdes, les xénolites inclus, l'âge isotopique ainsi que, significatif et incompatible, une grande intensité du champ et des contenus trace en éléments des terres rares.

AB  - "From diversity comes strength and wisdom": this was the guiding principle for selecting the articles in this collection. Because there is no single voice, identity, history, or cultural experience that represents the women of the First Nations, a realistic picture will have many facets. Accordingly, the authors in "Women of the First Nations" include Native and non-Native scholars, feminists, and activists from across Canada. Their work examines various aspects of Aboriginal women's lives from a variety of theoretical and personal perspectives. They discuss standard media representations, as well as historical and current realities. They bring new perspectives to discussions on Aboriginal art, literature, historical, and cultural contributions, and they offer diverse viewpoints on present economic, environmental, and political issues. This collection counters the marginalization and silencing of First Nations women's voices and reflects the power, strength, and wisdom inherent in their lives.

AB  - * 1Visualizing the distribution of rare or threatened species is necessary for effective implementation of conservation initiatives. Generalized linear models and geographical information systems (GIS) are now powerful tools for conservation planning, but issues of data availability, scale and model extrapolation complicate some applications.* 2Mountain caribou are an endangered ecotype of woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou that occurs across central and southern British Columbia, Canada. Currently, conservation professionals use coarse small-scale maps of important habitats to manage forest harvesting and human access across the northern extent of mountain caribou range. These maps were produced before the advent of readily available digital spatial information and are based on expert opinion and limited empirical data.* 3With the purpose of refining existing maps, we used survey results, radio-telemetry locations and GIS data to construct resource selection functions (RSF) that quantified the habitat affinities and predicted the relative probability of occurrence of mountain caribou at two spatial scales. At the scale of the patch, the most parsimonious RSF model consisted of covariates for vegetation and aptly predicted the occurrence of caribou across low- to mid-elevation habitats, but performed poorly across steep alpine terrain. At the landscape scale, a model containing Gaussian terms for elevation and slope was effective at predicting the broader distribution of caribou.* 4We produced a map consisting of the product of the relative probabilities of the patch and landscape RSF. The final map represented the relative probability of occurrence of caribou in vegetative patches weighted by the relative probability of occurrence across the larger study area. We found strong agreement between current definitions of important caribou habitats developed from expert opinion and RSF-based maps generated from empirical data.* 5Synthesis and applications. Both expert opinion and RSF-based approaches offer unique advantages for conservation mapping. Interpretability of results, documentation and repeatability of methods and data, estimates of precision and costs should all be considered when evaluating a technique. We argue that for some species and geographical locations, RSF is a superior technique, but expert opinion should play a role in model development and interpretation.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of the volatile constituents of red fox (Vulpes vulpes) urine in suppressing feeding by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) on coniferous tree seedlings. Pen and field bioassays indicated that the odor of fox urine and its principal component, 3-methyl-3-butenyl methyl sulfide, had a negative effect on feeding behavior of hares. The other sulfur-containing compounds, 2-phenylethyl methyl sulfide and 3-methylbutyl methyl sulfide, as well as six other constituents, were not effective. Synthetic urine mixtures composed of eight and nine volatile constituents, respectively, did not suppress feeding in pen bioassays. However, the mixture of eight compounds in a field bioassay did result in significantly fewer seedlings being eaten by hares than in the control. 3-Methyl-3-butenyl methyl sulfide may act as an interspecific chemical signal which induces a fear or avoidance response in hares. Additional work is required to determine the optimum concentration and release system for 3-methyl-3-butenyl methyl sulfide to be used as a mammalian semiochemical in crop protection.

AB  - * 1Most studies of animal movements and habitat selection do not recognize empirically that different components of the environment are important to animals at different scales. Often, availability of habitats is defined at one or more arbitrary spatio-temporal scales, but use of those habitats is constrained to one scale. Identification of scalar movement is the first step in developing models to explain why animals select or move to certain parts of their range. We used a non-linear curve-fitting model of movement rates to identify discontinuities in the scales of movement by woodland caribou Rangifer tarandus caribou collared with global positioning system (GPS) collars.* 2We differentiated intrapatch from interpatch movements, but were unable to distinguish interpatch from migratory-type movements for most combinations of individual caribou by season. Model fit was stronger for winter than summer movements. We suggest that increased patch heterogeneity during the winter resulted in interseason variation in movements and corresponding model fit.* 3Responses by caribou to the environment were scale-dependent. When we applied logistic regressions, land-cover type, energetic costs of movement, and predation risk differentiated the two scales of movement. Intrapatch movements had a lower cost of movement, were associated with cover types where foraging behaviours probably occurred, and were closer to areas of higher predator risk than interpatch movements.* 4Application of the non-linear model will aid in developing mechanism-based approaches to studying resource selection and animal behaviour.

AB  - Are we on the verge of a global environmental catastrophe, or is a modest revision of environmental policy all that is necessary to ensure our safety and prosperity? Governing the Environment considers both scenarios, and those between the two extremes, in its examination of current trends and challenges in managing environmental issues. This collection of seven essays, authored by leading Canadian academics, examines different aspects of the relationship between government and environmental issues. The volume focuses on Canadian contributions and innovations in the field, but it is of relevance to audiences around the world. Parson's introductory essay sets the stage for the complex discussions to follow. He provides background by sketching the Canadian institutional context for environmental protection: by describing the major pollutant burdens and the state of natural resources, and by summarizing the most salient policy issues. His conclusion elaborates on four major themes emerging from the work. These are the achievement of 'adaptive management'; the challenge of building effective government and interjurisdictional capacities for managing the environment; the need for networks to share responsibility more effectively without overlapping tasks; and finally, the real challenge to state authority that these undertakings represent. This work is written for a multidisciplinary academic audience, encompassing students and teachers of advanced environmental studies and Canadian public policy.

AB  - Analyses of observations from four lakes in British Columbia, Canada, compare estimates of the amplitude of thermocline deflections to predictions of wind-driven internal seiche amplitudes made using the Wedderburn number,W. The study sites range from the 750 m diameter Brenda Mines pit-lake to the 107 km long Kootenay Lake. Causal filtering of the wind data with a frequency cut-off based on the fundamental baroclinic time-scale is critical for correct calculation ofW. With the filtering incorporated, good comparison betweenW, its integral equivalent the Lake numberLN and the observations can be made. In all but the mine pit-lake, upwelling or near-upwelling conditions (W≈1) were encountered.

AB  - Water quality and availability is an urgent global concern. This paper documents, through the use of ethnographic research methods, First Nations� concerns and perspectives about water. The paper�s scope is primarily limited to the views of three Elders from the southern Interior of British Columbia: Mary Thomas from the Secwepemc, Millie Michell from the Nlaka�pamux, and Mary Louie from the Syilx Nation. Secondary literature sources complement the Elders� sharing of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). The Elders� emphasis on the spiritual impor-tance of water is contrasted with Western science�s emphasis on water�s unique physical and chemical properties. This fundamental difference raises questions about Western science�s approach to freshwater ecosystem management and study. Ultimately, this paper documents the wisdom of highly respected Elders about water in relation to the culture and freshwater ecosystems of South-Central British Columbia.

AB  - Recent studies have revealed a large and unexpected disparity between willingness-to-pay and compensation-demanded measures of economic loss. Further evidence of this difference is presented here, together with the results of a series of survey and real money exchange experiments which indicate that when advisors evaluate entitlements on behalf of third parties the variation between the measures is far less than is shown by individuals acting on their own behalf. Given the wide dependence on agents, a finding that they may weigh losses differently from people they act for suggests that agents' choices may compromise welfare positions.

AB  - Like most economic analyses, environmental loss assessments and policy prescriptions are based on the assumption that, income effects aside, willingness-to-pay and compensation-demanded valuations will be equivalent. The accumulating evidence from controlled tests indicates, however, that the compensation measure is commonly far larger than the payment measure. Consequently, it is likely that, among other implications, losses are understated, standards are set at inappropriate levels, policy selections are biased, too many environmentally degrading activities are encouraged, and too few mitigation efforts are undertaken.

AB  - This thoughtful collection exposes the gap between rhetoric and performance in Canada's response to environmental challenges. Canadians, despite their national penchant for environmental discussion, have fallen behind their G-8 peers in both domestic commitments and international actions. In a cogent examination of the issue, eight authors demonstrate how Canada's configuration of political and economic institutions has limited effective environmental policy. Canadian environmental institutions, the authors argue, have produced an integrity gap: the sustainability rhetoric adopted by policymakers fails to achieve concrete results. In an analysis that penetrates several policy domains and combines various disciplinary, sectoral, and geographic perspectives, the authors demonstrate how Canada fell from leader to laggard within the international environmental community.

SN  - 978-1-55458-813-8
AB  - Universal in scope, yet focusing on recognizable Canadian places, this collection of essays connects individuals’ love of nature to larger social issues, to cultural activities, and to sustainable technology. Subjects include activism in Cape Breton, eco-feminism, Native perspectives on the history of humans’ relationship with the natural world, the inconsistency of humankind’s affinity with nature alongside its capacity to destroy, and scientific and traditional accounts of evolution and how they can come together for the welfare of Earth’s ecology. These essays encourage us to break down the power-based divisions of centre versus marginal politics, to talk with our perceived enemies in environmental wars, to consider activism as a personal commitment, and to resist the construction of a “post-natural” world. Using a combination of personal memoirs and formal essays, Every Grain of Sand seeks to involve readers in the extraordinary places they inhabit—and usually take for granted—and will appeal to both the general reader and to students in humanities, social sciences, and environmental studies. It is unique for its presentation of entirely Canadian perspectives on ecology and environmental issues.

AB  - The Construction of the $1.2 billion Vancouver Island Highway Project provided an opportunity for the building trades unions and the Government of BC to negotiate an innovative collective agreement that included union membership, training for local residents and members of equity groups, new employment opportunities for members of designated equity groups and a comprehensive health and safety program.The Project implemented the most comprehensive system of tracking progress in employment equity in BC’s history. By its completion, women, First Nations, persons with disabilities and visible minorities accounted for just under 20% of total hours worked in an industry where 2% representation is the norm. Over 94% of payroll went to local residents, ensuring their communities the benefits of this major capital project. Finally, the health and safety record was significantly better than on any comparable construction project. Far from being an impediment to the efficient and timely completion of this major construction project, the collective agreement made it possible to deliver training, employment opportunities and regional development

AB  - This edited volume is a comprehensive examination of the legal framework in which environmental policy is fashioned in the major English-speaking federations—the United States, Canada, and Australia. The need for national solutions to environmental problems emerged long after the largest share of governmental power was allotted to states or provinces. This volume attempts to solve the paradox of how a country can have effective laws protecting the environment, vigorously enforced, when legislative and administrative powers are divided between two tiers of government. The contributors analyze environmental lawmaking along three dimensions. Part I describes the formal constitutional allocation of powers between states or provinces and the federal government, concluding that on paper environmental protection is essentially a local responsibility, although the reality is far different. In Part II the contributors explore the extent to which governments resort to informal negotiations among themselves to resolve environmental disputes. Part III is a thorough canvassing of the judiciary's role in making environmental policy and resolving disputes between levels and branches of government. In Australia and Canada, the courts play a relatively less important role in formulating policy than in the United States. In conclusion, the work shows that the level of environmental protection is relatively high in these three federations. Environmental politics, the work suggests, may be less divisive in federations than in unitary systems with comparable levels of development.

Pressure currently exists for a more balanced approach in which all legitimate interests in a water source are served. The worksheets include readings which focus on enough water for all, the water cycle (including a programmed exercise), power politics and hindsight, the selling of water, wetland areas, the new environment, the McGregor River diversion, the Alcan story, the Kemano Completion Project, the potential of the Stikline River, and water as a precious commodity. Charts of the world's water supply, British Columbia's major rivers, water balance graphs, and major hydroelectric power sites are also provided. Both readings and charts are accompanied by discussion questions. A brief test concludes the unit. (KC)

AB  - The purpose of the Heritage Conservation Act was to encourage and facilitate the conservation of British Columbia heritage resources. The resources were limited to four classes-historical, architectural, paleological and scenic. The statute created an appointed Board to advise the government and an agency, the Heritage Conservation Branch, to manage heritage resources in the province. The Branch attempted to bring together and integrate into a single heritage management team, a diverse group of professionals that included art historians, historians, architects, and physical planners. But in the first statute, there was no mention of heritage impact assessment. Following an internal Branch report, Guidelines for Heritage Resource Impact Assessment in British Columbia [Germann, 1981], the reference to impact assessment was added in 1981 when the Heritage Conservation Act was amended, [British Columbia, Legislature 1981]. The amendment, however, limited the application of heritage impact assessment to cases outside municipalities.The first important example of a formal heritage impact assessment in British Columbia was associated with the proposal of the British Columbia Hydro Power Corporation to dam the Peace River at Site "C" and flood 6000 hectares that contained 250 recorded pre-contact and historic heritage sites [British Columbia, Ministry of Municipal Affairs, Recreation and Culture, 1989]. In 1981 the Branch had supervised a heritage impact assessment that made recommendations to the Utilities Commission concerning mitigation and compensation for the unavoidable loss of heritage resources. But the Commission which convened public hearings as a formal component of the review process rejected the $5,965,000 mitigation and compensation package that had been recommended. The Commission was critical of both the research and its high costs, as well as the reasoning behind the recommendations. Due to issues unrelated to the mitigation recommendations, plans for the dam were put aside. Site "C" provides an unhappy example of heritage impact assessment since it appeared to have little or no influence on project planning. Indeed, prior to 1985 there are few, if any, good examples of heritage impact assessments which influenced development prospects in a significant way.After 1987, developers of large projects requiring EIA reviews had to face also the requirement of mandatory heritage impact assessment [[R. Kenny], 1991], along with social, economic and biophysical impact assessment. Until 1987 the only review guide with written regulatory reference to heritage impact assessment had been the Guide to the Energy Project Review Process, 1982 [British Columbia, Ministry of Energy Mines and Petroleum Resources, 1982]. Things changed after 1987 when many guides were reorganized, simplified, streamlined and made more explicit regarding regulatory heritage assessments. The Major Project Review Guidelines 1990 [British Columbia, Ministry of Regional and Economic Development and British Columbia Environment, 1990]; the Mines Development Review Process, [British Columbia, Ministry of Energy Mines and Petroleum Resources, 1989]; and the planned forest licence review guidelines all now contain explicit regulations regarding heritage impact assessment [O'Gorman, 1991].

TY  - thesis
AU  - Morgenroth, Josephine S.
AB  - The Kemano hydroelectric facility was constructed in the 1950s to supply power to thealuminum smelter in Kitimat, on the west coast of British Columbia. The Kemano projectincludes a 16 km long water conveyance tunnel that set world record advance rates in the1950s, and 8 km of a partially completed tunnel.A risk management strategy was developed in the late 1980s in case of collapse of the first water conveyance tunnel, and by 1990 the excavation of a second tunnel parallel to the first had begun. Work halted in 1991 due to environmental litigation and change in political climate. In 2011 the owner of the Kitimat smelter and the Kemano hydroelectric facility announced plans to continue work on the tunnel that was left unfinished. This thesis is a collaboration with Hatch Ltd., a consultant to the owner, to determine the ground conditions and support requirements that should be anticipated in completing the backup tunnel. Three dimensional finite element elastic stress modelling was completed in order to determine the in-situ stress conditions as well as the boundary stresses around the tunnel. The modelling results were used to estimate where stress-induced problem areas should be expected, for example at chainages 10+700 to 12+700 in the backup tunnel. The results of the stress modelling were incorporated into a Bayesian Belief Network that was developed for the Kemano tunnels. It was built using widely accepted empirical relationships in rock mechanics, expert judgement and conditional relationships between inputs. This network predicts the ground class at a user-defined chainage, based on a database that was developed from project literature. The user is also able to input new dataas it becomes available, for example during the tunnel advance. The predictions from the network align with what can be seen in the excavated portion of the backup tunnel, for example accurately predicting the need for steel sets at chainage 8+510. The predicted ground class was plotted as a function of chainage, and may be used as a comparison to the support requirements that have been determined thus far.

AB  - In countries having large territories and highly scattered population with explicit temporal and spatial variations in climate and availability of water resources, inter-basin water transfer projects seem to be the ultimate solution to alleviate water scarcity and assure a balanced economic development among different regions. But when such projects are considered for implementation, they raise many problems and controversies that may challenge the planners, policy-makers and institutional procedures. This paper analyses the environmental and ecological impact of existing inter-basin water transfer projects in Canada and examines the water policy-making procedures, water laws as well as other decision-making criteria.

AB  - Politics, Policy, and Government in British Columbia examines the political life of Canada's dynamic Pacific province. Each of the seventeen chapters, written by well-known experts, provides an up-to-date portrait and analysis of one of the many faces of B.C. politics. Taken together they provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the dominant themes and issues that have been the distinguishing features of the province's political life. Key elements of the book include sections on: the political setting, with discussions of BC's political culture and economy, and its relations with the rest of Canada and its own Native communities; B.C.-style politics, which focus on electoral and parliamentary party politics, the changing place of women in BC public life, and the critical role of the media in explaining it all to British Columbians; governing the province, with accounts of the premier and cabinet, the bureaucracy that delivers most government services, and the complex system -- from the police to the courts -- that provides the administration of justice and the rule of law; and contemporary policy issues, with clear explanations of the intricacies of fiscal and social policy, analyses of recent conflicts over forest policy and environmental protection, a discussion of the role of lobbyists, and an examination of what difference is made when NDP governments are elected. Anyone interested in B.C. or its politics will find this book an informative, up-to-date record of the processes and events that have marked B.C.'s past and will continue to shape its future.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Compton, Brian D.
AB  - This thesis deals with botanical knowledge, use and categorization among three Wakashan cultures (Oweekeno, Hanaksiala and Haisla) and a Southern Tsimshian group (Kitasoo) of the Central Coast and North Coast regions of British Columbia.The research has involved the first comprehensive attempt at the documentation of names and cultural roles for fungi and plants among these cultures. Approximately 90 taxa of fungi and plants are known to have had indigenous names and cultural roles in Kitasoo culture, approximately 100 taxa in Oweekeno culture and approximately 180 taxa in the Haisla and Hanaksiala cultures. Detailed accounts of the names and cultural roles of these species are presented.The basic features of Upper North Wakashan and Southern Tsimshian folk botanical nomenclature and categorization, as revealed from research among these representative groups, correspond in general with findings resulting from previous studies in the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere. A general 'plant' term is present in Upper North Wakashan, but lacking from Southern Tsimshian. Life-form categories are generally similar among all the study groups as are several intermediate botanical categories. A somewhat unusual "life-form complex" consisting of "berry bushes" and "berry bushes or any bush" is present in Southern Tsimshian, while a unique "fern" life-form is proposed for Oowekyala, Hanaksiala and Haisla. In both Upper North Wakashan and Southern Tsimshian some generic level taxa are seen to represent prototypes of more inclusive life-form categories and intermediate categories. Instances of folk specific categories corresponding to various colour forms of salmonberries (Rubus spectabilis) occur among all the study groups.In general, a number of nomenclatural and categorization features are shared by all the study groups despite fundamental and extensive differences between the Wakashan and Tsimshian languages. These similarities have probably arisen from extensive and lengthy cultural contact and interchange between the cultural groups. A map of the study area is provided as are several figures, tables and appendices that contain information pertaining to botanical knowledge, use and categorization among the study groups.

Each of three quadrants had a different size substrate and the fourth quadrant was left bare. We used one replicate of smaller size substrates (0.5–11.9 mm) and one replicate of larger size substrates (21.7–88 mm). It was found that the white sturgeon eleutheroembryos preferred substrate with an average size (longest diameter) of 12 mm (11.9) in the smaller substrate range and 22 mm (21.7) in the larger substrate range. These data improve our knowledge of white sturgeon early life history, and if confirmed in the wild can be used to protect areas that are crucial for white sturgeon recruitment and survival.

TI  - The Duty to Consult & the Elusive Crown: An Inquiry into Confusion, Conflation and the Diminished Presence of the Crown in Appellate Court Jurisprudence after Rio Tinto
TY  - report
AU  - Harman, Jason
SN  - ID 2851328
AB  - The project of reconciliation, heralded by the inclusion of section 35 in the Constitution Act, 1982, has made important strides as Canadian courts have expanded and elaborated the rights of Aboriginal peoples and the duties of the Crown. One of the key contributions to the s. 35 jurisprudence came with the Supreme Court of Canada’s development of the duty to consult in Haida in 2004. Haida was subsequently reaffirmed and expanded in the 2010 decision, Rio Tinto. However, since 2010, as First Nations groups continue to assert their rights, both superior and appellate courts have faced novel and uncontemplated invocations of the duty. The outcome of numerous appellate level decisions has seen both confusion and conflation of the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence in Haida and Rio Tinto. This has resulted in competing, and contradictory developments of the case law that jointly and paradoxically have the effect of diminishing the Crown’s duty to engage in consultation altogether. This paper principally examines two appellate level decisions, Neskonlith at the BC Court of Appeal, and Clyde River at the Federal Court of Appeal, in order to expose emerging problems in the duty to consult jurisprudence and to highlight the problem of the Crown’s withdrawal from what is, at its core, a quintessentially political process.

TI  - A selection of traditional medicinal remedies important to contermporary Carrier people in their treatment of disease
TY  - thesis
AU  - Ritch-Krc, Elizabeth Maud
AB  - This project focuses on the documentation and analysis of folkmedicines used by the Carrier people in northcentral BritishColumbia. It includes the traditional and contemporary plantknowledge of the medicinal properties of the plants, as well asmethods used to prepare and administer herbal remedies. Acollection of voucher specimens of the prepared medicinal plants andthe plants from which they were derived accompanies this project.Important Carrier medicinal plants include: Abies lasiocarpa, Alnusincana, Arctostaphylos uva-ursi, Artemisia frigida. Fragariavirginiana, Juniperus communis, Picea glauca, Pinus contorta,Populus tremuloides, Rubus idaeus, Salix sp. and Shepherdiacanadensis.The antimicrobial properties of some of the medicines wereevaluated to determine the therapeutic properties of traditionalherbal preparations. Using the disk diffusion method aqueousmedicinal preparations, pitch preparations and methanolic extractswere screened against five known human pathogens: Escherichia coli,Staphlyococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. The results indicated definite antimicrobialactivity in the pitch preparations of Picea glauca andPinus contorta and provide a starting point for the pharmacognosticevaluation of these plants.In addition, a cytoxicity assay - colorimetric method - wasused to test the anticancer activity of the methanolic extracts ofAlnus incana and Shepherdia canadensis against mouse mastocytomacells. Preliminary results indicated that A. incana possessed definiteanticancer properties. S. canadensis also produced some cytotoxicactivity, although not as great as that produced by A. incana.The study provides further evidence to support thepharmacological validity of Native herbal medicines.

TI  - Moving Backwards: Does the Lack of Duty to Consult Create the Right to Infringe Aboriginal and Treaty Rights?

AB  - The federal and provincial governments have a duty to consult Aboriginal people when they propose to authorize development activities that may impact Aboriginal or treaty rights. This article comments on two recent cases addressing the role of third parties, such as municipalities and private businesses, in the duty to consult and accommodate. In Neskonlith Indian Band v Salmon Arm City and Wahgoshig First Nation v Solid Gold Resources Corp, the courts focused on whether the particular entity had a duty to consult. The consequence of finding no duty to consult was that the activity in dispute could proceed. This case commentary argues that the courts conflate who has the duty to consult and whether consultation is necessary before a project can proceed. These are two separate legal issues. Consultation is a condition precedent to proceeding with a project that infringes or potentially infringes Aboriginal rights. A revised version of this paper is now available as: Shin Imai & Ashley Stacey, “Municipalities and the Duty to Consult Aboriginal Peoples: A Case Comment on Neskonlith Indian Band v Salmon Arm (City)” pp 293-311, (2014) 47:1 UBC L Rev 293.

AB  - In a world characterized by an encroaching homogeneity induced by the growth of multi-national corporations and globalization, the causes of difference accrue new levels of importance. This is as true of tourism as in many other spheres of life – and one cause of differentiation for tourism promotion is the culture of Indigenous Peoples. This offers opportunities for cultural renaissance, income generation and enhanced political empowerment, but equally there are possible costs of creating commodities out of aspects of life that previously possessed spiritual meaning. This book examines these issues from many different perspectives; from those of product design and enhancement; of the aspirations of various minority groupings; and the patterns of displacements that occur – displacements that are not simply spatial but also social and cultural. How can these changes be managed? Case studies and analysis is offered, derived from many parts of the globe including North America, Asia and Australasia. The contributors themselves have, in many instances, worked closely with groups and organizations of Indigenous Peoples and attempt to give voice to their concerns. The book is divided into various themes, each with a separate introduction and commentary. The themes are Visitor Experiences, Who manages Indigenous Cultural Tourism Product, Events and Artifacts, Conceptualisation and Aspiration. In a short final section the silences are noted – each silence representing a potential challenge for future research to build upon the notions and lessons reported in the book. The book is edited by Professor Chris Ryan from New Zealand, and Michelle Aicken of Horwath Asia Pacific.

AB  - Aboriginal people in Canada have long struggled to regain control over their traditional forest lands. There have been significant gains in the quest for Aboriginal self-determination over the past few decades, including the historic signing of the Nisga’a Treaty in 1998. Aboriginal participation in resource management is on the rise in both British Columbia and other Canadian provinces, with some Aboriginal communities starting their own forestry companies. Aboriginal Peoples and Forest Lands in Canada brings together the diverse perspectives of Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals to address the political, cultural, environmental, and economic implications of forest use. The book discusses the need for professionals working in forestry and conservation to understand the context of Aboriginal participation in resource management. It also addresses the importance of researching traditional knowledge and traditional land use and examines the development of co-management initiatives and joint ventures between government, forestry companies, and native communities.

AB  - While no access and benefit-sharing policy is yet in place in Canada, consent, benefit sharing and other issues relevant to bioprospecting and biodiversity research are important points of discussion at national as well as institutional and community levels. Although some plant species in Canada that are heavily exploited for commercial purposes have suffered serious decline, which has affected cultural uses by Aboriginal peoples, a primary difference from the San- Hoodia case is that much of the Canadian biodiversity debate has taken place in the abstract, based largely on rights and responsibilities emerging from potential scenarios rather than real instances of successful commercial products derived from traditional knowledge. New national human research ethics guidelines for research involving Aboriginal peoples are likely to provide a key reference point for addressing issues raised in the biodiversity context when the appropriation of traditional knowledge is involved.Canadian biodiversity policy will likely include good ethical practice standards and promote collaboration and adherence to community-level protocols for current and future biodiversity research and development. However, traditional knowledge appropriation from already published literature is unlikely to be addressed, even though such knowledge may not have made its way into the published record by ethical means. This significant policy gap should be informed by the San- Hoodia case, which sets an important precedent by enabling Aboriginal communities and biological populations to be supported through benefits and capacity-building, even when bioprospecting is based on the published literature.

AB  - This paper presents the rational and theoretical setting for research focusing on Aboriginal economic development of forest resources. Acknowledging that 1) previous initiatives to support Aboriginal involvement in the forest sector have had limited success to date, and 2) we have little understanding of what economic development of forest resources really means for Aboriginal people, this paper advocates a community-driven approach to forest development, where a First Nation community can address the following four questions: What do we have? Where do we want to be? How do we get there? How well are we doing? In doing so, the First Nation community will strategically define 1) its capacity to engage in the economic development of forest resources, 2) its goals in doing so, 3) the steps needed to successfully take advantage of the opportunities at hand, and 4) the criteria and indicators of success.

AB  - Environmental issues are often highly politicized. Indigenous peoples may be reluctant to participate in research due to a history of colonization and negative experiences with researchers—described as a “chronic conflict”. We present a case where an acute conflict (an event that creates intense mistrust among stakeholders) occurred during a research project. The project studied a contentious issue: the sharing of dugong and turtle meat by Indigenous Australians. The chronic conflict of colonial history and Western research was exacerbated by media coverage of related issues when the project was starting, making participants unwilling to participate in our research. We adapted established Indigenous engagement protocols and—both literally and figuratively—set the table in response to the sociopolitical context of the research. This engagement process enabled us to establish trusting relationships with participants, and could benefit most researchers seeking to engage people, irrespective of Indigeneity or context.

TI  - Commonality Among Unique Indigenous Communities: An Introduction to Climate Change and Its Impacts on Indigenous Peoples
TY  - journalArticle
AU  - Abate, Randall S.
AU  - Warner, Kronk
AU  - Ann, Elizabeth
AB  - This book (Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples: The Search for Legal Remedies) explores how climate change affects the rights of indigenous peoples. Climate change is a global environmental problem caused by greenhouse gas emissions. Although the causes of this problem are global, the adverse impacts of climate change are disproportionately burdening indigenous peoples. In recognition of the growing global problem of climate change, legal strategies to address climate change through mitigation and adaptation have been undertaken. This book recognizes that indigenous people are particularly vulnerable to climate change, both physically and legally, and addresses the challenges that these communities face in responding to climate change impacts. In defining “indigenous peoples” it is important to note that the term covers a widely diverse group of people and that no two communities of indigenous people are the same. That being said, however, there are some commonalities that exist between groups of indigenous peoples. For example, most indigenous communities existed as autonomous communities and nations before contact with foreign societies. As a result of contact with foreign, dominant societies, many indigenous communities suffered generations of abuse and subjugation. As a result, many modern indigenous communities lack the economic and political clout of dominant societies. Beyond this history of oppression, many indigenous communities also share unique legal and spiritual connections to their environment. Moreover, because of their unique histories, the law affecting indigenous communities is different in many localities. Although indigenous communities throughout the world differ, Part I of this chapter addresses some of the commonalities between indigenous peoples in greater depth: (1) increased vulnerability to climate change related to the location of indigenous communities; (2) a unique connection to the land for legal, spiritual, and cultural reasons; (3) a history of colonization and oppression that has potentially increased the vulnerability of many indigenous communities; and (4) recognition under public international law that there are basic rights owed to indigenous communities. Recognizing these commonalities is crucial to understanding the legal mechanisms available to assist indigenous communities in adapting to the threats posed by climate change. Part II of this chapter addresses three of these legal responses: (1) law suits based on procedural rights; (2) law suits based on common law legal principles; and (3) law suits based on public international law.

TI  - Blackwater Mine and the collaborative moose health monitoring program
TY  - thesis
AU  - Lis, Doron
AB  - In response to the rapid rate of multiple natural resource developments in British Columbia (BC) First Nations across the province are raising concern about the health and safety of traditional food or ‘country food’ sources. This concern has led to a large number of requests by BC First Nations to monitor country foods. Furthermore, a progressive approach to environmental assessment of mines in BC includes the implementation of a program to assess and monitor country foods especially when mine developments occur on or near First Nations traditional food gathering lands. Such monitoring programs can also be incorporated into Impact Benefit Agreements, which have become a key social tool for mining companies working on or near Aboriginal lands. The mining industry in BC has only recently begun to specifically assess the potential impacts of mining on country foods. However, this assessment has lacked both depth and guidance. New Gold, a mid-tier mining company, has implemented a ‘Country Food Monitoring Plan’ as part of an application for an environmental impact assessment of the proposed Blackwater Mine in central BC. In particular, moose were identified by local First Nations as a country food of primary concern. This report describes a unique collaboration between New Gold and the Lhoosk’uz Dene Nation and hunting guide outfitters, with support from wildlife veterinarians to develop and pilot the implementation of a moose health monitoring program. The goal is to establish a community-based monitoring program to provide information to First Nations and others on moose health and any potential threats via ingestion of country foods to humans throughout all stages, including construction, operation and post-closure, of the Blackwater Mine. This research can be used by industry, government, First Nations, and other stakeholders to provide a framework and model to approach the assessment and monitoring of the health and safety of country foods near mining development and other natural resource extractive activities.

AB  - Most American Indian reservations are islands of poverty in a sea of wealth, but they do not have to remain that way. To extract themselves from poverty, Native Americans will have to build on their rich cultural history including familiarity with markets and integrate themselves into modern economies by creating institutions that reward productivity and entrepreneurship and that establish tribal governments that are capable of providing a stable rule of law. The chapters in this volume document the involvement of indigenous people in market economies long before European contact, provide evidence on how the wealth of Indian Nations has been held hostage to bureaucratic red tape, and explains how their wealth can be unlocked through self-determination and sovereignty.

AB  - Colonial work was in part a disruption to the connection of land and resources, and if you disrupt land, communities and resources, you disrupt culture, identity and sustenance practices. In this thesis, I examine what colonization is, as well as the historical colonial powers that have been at work in First Nations communities with a particular focus on identity and the consequences of territorial displacements and how that has impeded traditional Aboriginal diets. I also include a location of self and what led me on this journey. Additionally, I examine what health and well-being looks like for the Indigenous population concerning traditional foods, food security with access playing a pivotal role. The third component addresses the contemporary well-being of Aboriginal Peoples and the potential to rejuvenate culture and identity through a new uptake of relations with traditional and wholesome foods.

TI  - Literacy practices in a First Nations community: Women writing culture
TY  - thesis
AU  - Frost, Alanna
AB  - This dissertation examines the literacy practices of a group of First Nations women who live in British Columbia and whose jobs entail the production and dissemination of texts which reflect the local, Carrier, culture. In this qualitative study of eight First Nations women from Western Canada, I investigate the fact that these women produce texts and materials reflective of First Nations culture in an environment with a history of violence against their community and against the very culture about which they write. By outlining the historical, geographic, and material conditions under which my participants produce texts, I demonstrate the complexity of literacy practices conducted amidst the tensions created in the dynamic between the dominant and local cultural collectives and between differing perceptions of local socio-historic and geographic “facts.”This dissertation is divided into four chapters. Chapter One introduces my participants and offers a necessary discussion of the ethical dilemmas inherent in the representation of Aboriginal populations—those whose historical relationship to research agendas have been fraught with misrepresentation. After reviewing scholarship which articulates the ethics of representation, particularly that offered by Aboriginal scholars, I discuss my own use of critical ethnography as a means of mitigating those ethical dilemmas. Chapter Two reviews the educational history of the two participants who experienced residential school educations in British Columbia. The educational agendas of residential schools were designed to limit First Nations People's literate abilities; Chapter Two is thus premised on the necessity of understanding my participants' educational history in order to contextualize their contemporary work.Chapters Three and Four utilize cases studies to explore the specific literacy practices of the participants. Chapter Three argues that the complexity of literacy practices in one participant's composing work extends to an understanding of history as bound to a local, particular physical space. The texts, historical accounts of the Nazko First Nations produced by Doreen Patrick, cannot be separated from her community's physical spaces and further must be understood in the context of their, fiercely contested, understanding of land, ownership, and discovery. Chapter Four concludes this dissertation with an overview of the connection between literacy practices and culture. In this chapter, I argue that literacy practices are directly tied to a dynamic and contested understanding of culture and further (and reciprocally) that cultural practices are not definable without discussions of literacy practices—of those material conditions under which the production of “culture” occurs—those texts, jobs, signs, of culture which profess themselves to be directly related to Carrier culture.

AB  - Beginning in the nineteenth century, Anglo-Canadian colonial agents (residential school administrators and teachers, missionaries, and government officials) introduced a number of Western-style sporting activities among Indigenous peoples through athletic clubs, church gatherings, and school physical fitness programs. In keeping with a Victorian conception of leisure, these elites understood sports in moral terms, believing that they would support “civilizing projects” intended to remake Indigenous socio-cultural spaces into colonial ones. Indigenous communities, however, used these same sports organizations to challenge, resist, and even displace colonial agendas. Inspired by J.R. Miller's treatment of Indigenous–non-Indigenous relations as a nuanced, multidirectional, often contradictory encounter, we argue that “Indian Sports Days” in coastal British Columbia from the 1910s–1940s were complex social spaces, reflective of both Indigenous and colonial perspectives.

TI  - Capturing vulnerability : towards a method for assessing, mitigating, and monitoring gendered violence in mining communities in British Columbia
TY  - thesis
AU  - Stockwell, Alison Marie
AB  - The impacts of the extractive industry (mining, oil and gas) on the health and safety of rural and Aboriginal women are largely unidentified and unmitigated in British Columbia (BC) environmental assessments. In relation to extractive industries, women experience direct and indirect impacts in unique ways. Globally, evidence suggests that extractive industries are associated with increased incidence of substance abuse, prostitution, and violence against women. Rural and Aboriginal women are among the most vulnerable people in Canada. They experience high levels of domestic and non-domestic violence and have limited access to health services. While BC’s environmental assessments are increasingly rigorous, health impacts beyond environmental exposures, such as those related to violence in communities, are considered out of scope and the indicators used to assess, mitigate, and monitor them remain undeveloped. This research, part of a collaborative five-year project on extractive industries and community health in BC, sought to: (1) synthesize findings from the literature on women’s health and safety in relation to extractive industry development; (2) identify indicators of vulnerability of rural and Aboriginal women to violent victimization in BC; and (3) develop a mapped composite indicator to identify regions of BC where poor health, substance abuse, and violence are endemic, and where women are at risk of violent victimization. The resulting indicator provides a proposed model for assessing and monitoring population vulnerability in relation to major projects and enhancing the current environmental assessment process. Results indicate that BC’s northernmost regions are highly vulnerable, characterized by low health status and access to services, high levels of substance abuse and violent crime, and a high proportion of women at risk of violent victimization. Recommendations are made for extractive industry proponents, regulators and impact assessors, and affected communities to make use of quantitative tools to better capture vulnerability in relation to extractive projects. Subsequently, targeted mitigation measures that address violence and consider the needs of vulnerable populations can be prescribed in regions where extractive industry projects operate. This work was completed as part of the University of British Columbia Bridge Program with funding from Vancouver Foundation and the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.

AB  - Aboriginal and Visible Minority Librarians: Oral Histories from Canada, is a collection of chapters written by librarians of color in Canada writing about their experiences working in libraries. This book is not only for librarians in Canada and for those who aspire to become librarians, it is also for deans, directors, and faculty of libraries and library schools, managers and supervisors in libraries, human resources personnel, and other decision-makers in the field. It will also appeal to researchers interested in race relations, multiculturalism, intercultural communications and management, cross-cultural communications and management, cross-cultural studies, diversity, Aboriginal peoples, indigenous populations, and ethnic or visible minorities.The majority of the chapters written by visible minority librarians come from those born outside of Canada. They speak of their love for their new country, its generosity and support towards newcomers and immigrants, and their reasons for taking up the library profession. While few of the librarians speak of open racism, they narrate their experiences as those filled with challenges, self-doubt and courage. Several of the Aboriginal librarians who contributed to this book have worked within tribal communities and tribal libraries. In spite of working within community environments, they have experienced challenges, especially related to lack of funding. These librarians speak of having to deal with tokenism, lack of mentorship, and working in professional isolation. Some of them narrate their challenges in working with colleagues who do not relate to them. Lack of support is common, as many organizations do not have proper strategies to deal with discrimination. However, these chapters end with a positive note of encouragement for future librarians; the authors encourage all librarians to be engaged, find trusted mentors, seek help when needed, focus on professional development, and find a niche in the organization.

AB  - Rethinking Indigenous legal orders and law is fundamentally about rebuilding citizenship. The theory underlying this chapter is that it is possible to develop a flexible, overall legal framework that Indigenous peoples might use to express and describe their legal orders and laws so that they can be applied to present-day problems. This framework must be able to first, reflect the legal orders and laws of decentralized (i.e. non-state) Indigenous peoples, and second, allow for the diverse way that each society’s culture is reflected in their legal orders and laws. In turn, this framework will allow each society to draw on a deeper understanding of how their own legal traditions might be used to resolve contemporary conflicts. Colonial histories cannot be undone. This means that Indigenous peoples must figure out how to reconcile former decentralized legal orders and law with a centralized state and legal system. Any process of reconciliation must include political deliberation on the part of an informed and involved Indigenous citizenry.

AB  - As a method of recording Indigenous uses of the land, traditional land use mapping is a fixture in resource development-related consultation. In light of the recent Tsilhqot’in Decision in the Supreme Court of Canada, we argue that traditional land use documentation must move beyond the mapping of individual sites. Such work must consider the contexts in which Indigenous peoples use their traditional lands and as well as local, Indigenous concepts of management and governance. Drawing on an example of from Secwepemc territory in south-central British Columbia, we argue that the Tsilhqot’in Decision gives legal support to a more nuanced conception of the places of cultural significance to Indigenous peoples. We demonstrate further that the “spaces” between the places on traditional land use maps must be brought to the fore in development-related consultation.

AB  - The Routledge Companion to Cultural Property contains new contributions from scholars working at the cutting edge of cultural property studies, bringing together diverse academic and professional perspectives to develop a coherent overview of this field of enquiry. The global range of authors use international case studies to encourage a comparative understanding of how cultural property has emerged in different parts of the world and continues to frame vital issues of national sovereignty, the free market, international law, and cultural heritage. Sections explore how cultural property is scaled to the state and the market; cultural property as law; cultural property and cultural rights; and emerging forms of cultural property, from yoga to the national archive. By bringing together disciplinary perspectives from anthropology, archaeology, law, Indigenous studies, history, folklore studies, and policy, this volume facilitates fresh debate and broadens our understanding of this issue of growing importance. This comprehensive and coherent statement of cultural property issues will be of great interest to cultural sector professionals and policy makers, as well as students and academic researchers engaged with cultural property in a variety of disciplines.

AB  - In an effort to build understanding of diverse Indigenous experiences with the Olympics, we explore the relationship between the Vancouver Organizing Committee and the Four Host First Nations Society (FHFN). The research is grounded in theory that stresses the social influence and political nature of material–cultural landscapes. The article also connects important details from two disparate literatures: the politics and imagery of Olympic hosting, and the history and tensions surrounding Aboriginal sovereignty in British Columbia (BC). After discussing our methodological approach and reviewing this literature, we trace the formalisation of the FHFN and consider how protocol agreements guided its relationship with the Vancouver Organizing Committee. Next, we overview programmes that enlisted Aboriginal artists and entrepreneurs, highlighting how prominent additions to the material–cultural landscape were produced and overseen, and have since been discursively framed. The hosting relationship has resulted in benefits for some Aboriginal persons and businesses. However, it has also imprinted the landscape in ways that may (re)legitimise dominant political, economic and cultural objectives and perspectives over time. Thus, we question whether the relationship should be taken as a model for future Indigenous participation in the Olympics and/or as evidence of improved relations between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal peoples in BC.

TI  - By the Road: Fordism, Automobility, and Landscape Experience in the British Columbia Interior, 1920-1970
TY  - thesis
AU  - Bradley, B. E. N.
AB  - This dissertation examines how popular experiences of nature and history in the British Columbia Interior were structured by automobility – the system of objects, spaces, images, and practices that surrounded private automobiles and public roads. The Fordist state poured massive resources into the provincial road network during the period 1920 to 1970, and in the process created new possibilities for leisure and for profit. Motoring was a new, very modern way of experiencing BC, and also an important economic engine. Making the province’s highways and the landscapes that were visible alongside them look appealing to the motoring public became a matter of concern for many different parties. Boosters, businesses, and tourism promoters who stood to benefit from increased automobile travel often cultivated roadside attractions and lobbied the state to do the same. Starting in the early 1940s, the provincial government established numerous parks along the Interior highway network: the two examined here are Manning and Hamber parks. Beginning in the late 1950s it did the same with historical sites: Barkerville, Fort Steele, and several others are examined here. These and other parks and historic sites were established, developed, and managed as roadside amenities, and were used to deliver lessons about nature and history to the motoring public ‘by the road.’ Drawing on a wide range of examples from across the BC Interior, including both successes and failures, this thesis examines how the motoring public’s common landscape experiences were shaped by state-built infrastructure and by various groups’ efforts to manage, manipulate, and modify the landscapes that were visible by the road.

AB  - This article reports on a recent study into the experiences of Indigenous and allied environmental activists with teaching and learning during and as a result of Indigenous environmental movements. This inquiry is grounded in a theoretical framework informed by decolonization and cultural revitalization, social movement learning, and repressive tolerance. Interviews with 10 participants across Canada produced rich insights related to significant life experiences, the tensions encountered by activist educators, the complexity of inter-activist relationships, interaction with police agencies, the plurality of protest, and the revitalization and sharing of Indigenous traditions as the ultimate form of resistance.

AB  - In 1985 and 1986, ninety-year-old Witsuwit'en Chief, Maxlaxlex - or Johnny David as he is better known - was the first Witsuwit'en to give Commission Evidence in the Delgamuukw land claims case in which the Witsuwit'en and Gitxsan of Northern British Columbia were battling for title to their traditional territories. 'Hang Onto These Words' presents the actual transcripts of the questions and answers between lawyers working on both sides and this knowledgeable and outspoken Native elder who spoke in his own language and whose words were then translated by an interpreter into English. The evidence was given in a makeshift courtroom set up in David's own home. Anthropologist Antonia Mills was present during these proceedings, and in this book, she introduces and contextualizes the evidence within the Delgamuukw case. In his testimony, David provides a rich description of the Witsuwit'en way of life as well as the injustices suffered at the hands of Indian agents and settlers. He ends his testimony saying, "If you hang on to these words, everything will be all right." The challenge of hearing his voice, and using it to negotiate the meaning and substance of Aboriginal rights remains unresolved and resonant.

TY  - book
AU  - Mills, Antonia Curtze
SN  - 978-0-7748-0513-1
AB  - Eagle Down Is Our Law is about the struggle of the Witsuwit'en peoples to establish the meaning of aboriginal rights. With the neighbouring Gitksan, the Witsuwit'en launched a major land claims court case asking for the ownership and jurisdiction of 55,000 square kilometers of land in north-central British Columbia that they claim to have held since before the arrival of the Europeans. In conjunction with that court case, the Gitksan and Witsuwit'en asked a number of expert witnesses, among them Antonia Mills, an anthropologist, to prepare reports on their behalf. Her report, which instructs the judge in the case on the laws, feasts, and institutions of the Witsuwit'en, is presented here. Her testimony is based on two years of participant observation with the Witsuwit'en peoples and on her reading of the anthropological, historic, archaeological, and linguistic data about the Witsuwit'en. In 1991, the judge who rendered the decision in the court case, known as Delgamuukw v. the Queen, dismissed the testimony of Mills and other anthropologists and ruled that the Witsuwit'en and Gitksan have no aboriginal title. This book contains the report that Mills rendered to the court. With its publication, the public can judge the quality of the expert opinion report for themselves. The report is introduced by Chief Gisdaywa (Alfred Joseph) of the Witsuwit'en, Chief Mas Gak (Don Ryan) of the Gitksan, anthropologist Michael Kew, and legal scholar Michael Jackson. A prologue by Mills describes the report in the context of the epic three-year court case, and an epilogue, also by Mills, describes what has happended in the provincial appeal and what the Gitksan and Witsuwit'en have done since the decision to further address the issues of aboriginal rights.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Robinson, Rheanna
AB  - This study examines the promises and challenges of integrating Indigenous Knowledge (IK) into the academy from the perspectives of Elders, leaders, students, staff, and instructors from three Aboriginal post-secondary institutions in British Columbia. Using a case study method and an Indigenous and Western theoretical foundations, this research shares the perceived successes, limitations, and the challenges the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology (NVIT), the Wilp Wilxo'oskwhl Nisga’a Institute (WWNI), and the former Cariboo Chilcotin Weekend University (CCWU) program face, or have faced, in the integration of IK. Also included in this study are perspectives from individuals from one mainstream, non-Aboriginal institution, the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). Topics explored through the research are the following: a) challenges and benefits of integrating IK in three Aboriginal institutes and how the integration of IK at the academic level in Aboriginal institutions impacts and benefits students, staff, and the local community; b) the challenges and benefits of partnerships with mainstream institutes; and c) the formal policies and/or lack of formal policy for Aboriginal institutes. As a result of the research, emerging themes include: Elders have a core role in higher learning; the integration of IK at a post-secondary level impacts higher learning; Aboriginal post-secondary institutes have taken the lead in building partnerships with post-secondary institutes; and Aboriginal post-secondary institutes demonstrate resiliency despite systemic challenges. To represent my position as a Métis scholar I present my findings through the framework of the Métis Sash that represents through its colour and design the integration of key concepts and findings from the study.

AB  - Albian coal measures of the Skeena Group in the Telkwa coalfield comprise more than 500 m of conglomerate, sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and coal that were deposited during two regressive/transgressive cycles. The stratigraphic sequence is divisible into four lithostratigraphic units. The basal unit (Unit 1) is about 100 m thick and comprises conglomerate, sandstone, mudstone, coal and seatearth deposited in a fluvial environment on a deeply eroded volcanic basement. Gravel and sand were deposited in braided channels and bars, and mud accumulated in floodplains. Peat accumulated in poorly drained backswamps. In the northern part of the study area, coal seams thin and split, a result of periodic flooding of peat swamps with sediment-laden water from nearby streams. Deposition of Unit I ended with marine transgression. Unit II consists of up to 140 m of silty mudstone, bioturbated and cross-bedded, chert and muscovite-rich sandstone, and rare thin carbonaceous mudstones deposited in a shallow marine environment. The sands were deposited as distributary channels and mouth-bars. Muds were deposited in bays and thin discontinuous peat accumulated in local salt marshes. Unit III averages 90 m in thickness and comprises bioturbated and rippled, chert and muscovite-rich sandstone, siltstone, carbonaceous mudstone and thick coal seams deposited in a variety of low-energy, paralic environments. Sand and mud were deposited and biogenically reworked in tidal flats, and siltstone accumulated in a restricted, nearshore marine environment to the east. Peat accumulated in freshwater coastal, domed mires which periodically prograded over tidal flats. All but the lowermost coal seams pinch out eastward into brackish and nearshore marine sediments. The ash yield of many coals increases towards their seaward margin. Locally, the sulphur yield of the coal is high, reflecting occasional inundation by brackish water. The coals were deposited during regressive maximum and are characterized by an essentially vertical stacking pattern comprising an aggradational parasequence set. The major coals are considered to have been deposited at the turnaround between progradation and retrogradation. Unit IV is over 150 m thick and is composed of chloritic sandstone overlain by silty mudstone, deposited in a marine environment. The basal sandstone is a transgressive lag deposit. Silty mudstone is the predominant lithofacies and was deposited in a nearshore, shallow marine environment.

AB  - The Buck Creek volcanic complex of the Intermontane Superterrane of the Canadian Cordillera records a long history of volcanic activity from the Cretaceous through to the Eocene, when magmatic activity peaked, to the Miocene. Its basement includes primitive continental arc volcanic rocks of the Jurassic Hazelton Group (∼200 Ma; mainly basalt and andesites) emplaced prior to the accretion of Stikinia during the Mesozoic. In contrast, in the post-accretionary volcanic complex, the major pulse of volcanism started with the extrusion of continental margin calc-alkaline rocks (basaltic andesites to rhyolites) of the Cretaceous Tip Top Hill Formation (∼85 Ma). Their Nd-Sr isotopic compositions resemble those of the pre-accretionary Hazelton Group. However, this post-accretionary Cretaceous arc was more evolved and its crust was significantly thicker than the Hazelton. Mafic rocks of both the Hazelton and Tip Top Hill suites were generated from a spinel-bearing mantle source. The Eocene volcanics (∼50 Ma) evolved from typical high-K calc-alkaline mafic/intermediate rocks to flows that resemble intraplate tholeiitic basalts. Collectively, the Eocene rocks had a common (and comparatively deep) source, likely garnet-bearing subcontinental lithosphere. These compositional variations are probably related, in part, to an increase in the degree of partial melting. They record a gradual change from a compressional to an extensional tectonic environment, and overall represent an arc setting that matured and thickened over ca. 35 m.y., culminating in Eocene extension coincident with the cessation of compression in the foreland fold-and-thrust belt. Overlying intraplate alkali basaltic rocks of Miocene age appear to represent the final stage of this transition, as subduction-modified lithospheric mantle was replaced by a new asthenospheric mantle source. The association of Cretaceous, Eocene, and Miocene volcanic rocks in the Buck Creek complex is widespread in the region, suggesting that this model of tectono-magmatic evolution can be applied elsewhere in central British Columbia.

AB  - During the 1990s, the provincial government of British Columbia made the introduction of participatory processes into the land use planning and resource management of its Crown lands the central element of its attempt to defuse conflictual relationships over choices affecting the sustainability of the province's development strategies. The processes used to this end are examined, and evidence of the resulting outcomes is evaluated. As well as the planning gains associated with the switch from techno‐corporatist to consensual decision‐making for the province's publicly owned resource base, studies indicate that there will be substantial ecological benefits from zoning an additional 30% of Crown lands for enhanced protection, at little economic cost to rural industries. The new rural planning regime also offers a consensual management system capable of assimilating the tribal holdings created by the settlement of First Nation claims on Crown lands. Overall, the evidence indicates that substantial benefits have emerged from the application of procedural environmental justice to formerly highly technocratic management processes, not least of which is delivery of “peace in the woods”.

AB  - In this essay the author discusses a new play by Canadian playwright Sharon Pollock called Kabloona Talk (2007). The historical context for this contemporary play is the 1914 murders of two Roman Catholic Missionary priests by two Inuit in the Canadian Arctic, followed by two sensational trials held in southern Canada in 1917. Several attempts have been made by writers and scholars to represent what happened and why, but Pollock's play offers a fascinating look at the political manoeuvring that took place behind the scenes as the white lawyers struggled with the conflict between the dictates of European law and the principles guiding the behaviour of a remote group of Inuit about whom white southern Canadians knew next to nothing. Rather than focus on either the murders or the trials, Pollock uses this actual event to explore the timeless issues of justice, and cultural encounter and misunderstanding.

AB  - One energy option for Canada which stands forth as being environmentally more compatible than other available options is hydroelectric power. However we can no longer afford to construct hydroelectric projects without examining all aspects of environmental concern. If projects are planned properly in consultation with public and government agencies, and effective mitigation measures are taken, there is no reason why hydroelectric power cannot be environmentally compatible. It is believed that some changes are needed and further work is necessary towards achieving compatibility between the environmental and other important engineering and socio-economic considerations.

AB  - Alcan is constructing the final phase of its hydroelectric project in north-central British Columbia, and is diverting additional water from the headwaters of the Nechako River in the Fraser River drainage, through the coast range to the Kemano River on the Pacific Coast. The decreased flow in the Nechako River can result in high water temperatures and increased thermal stress to migrating sockeye salmon enroute to their spawning grounds in tributory rivers. In response to this concern the Nechako River hydrothermal monitoring and control program was designed and developed to manage downstream water temperatures and flows in the Nechako River following construction of the Kemano Completion Project. The objectives of the project are to prevent mean daily water temperatures in the Nechako River above the Stuart River confluence from exceeding 20 degree C and to control flows in the Nechako River below Cheslatta Falls and at Vanderhoof during the water temperature control period (July 20 to August 20). The Triton flow model is a modification of the UBC flow model designed to meet specific requirements of the project.

AB  - The substrates of streams are often sampled as part of scientific studies or environmental impact assessments or for monitoring project operations; however, there are no generally accepted standards for a well-designed program. We propose the use of a hybrid McNeil-freeze-core apparatus to collect samples that are unbiased with respect to the grain-size distribution in alluvial gravels. Consideration of sample-size standards demonstrates that multiple 13-kg cores are necessary to describe the full distribution if material greater than 32 mm is present. Alternatively, the observed grain-size distribution may be truncated to ensure representative samples. The sampling strategy depends upon the information requirements of the program. The number of substrate samples required for various levels of precision of the estimated mean percent fines at a site is calculated from sampling programs in British Columbia and the Yukon Territory. Based on these studies, costs are estimated for our recommended program.

AB  - While the influence of multicultural and anti-racist education has declined significantly in England and Wales since the late 1980s (as a result of the continuing impact of New Right thinking on education policy), this has not occurred in other countries. For example, in Canada successive federal administrations-irrespective of political hue-have remained firmly committed to Pierre Trudeau's (1971) pluralistic notion of the Canadian 'mosaic' and continued to endorse educational and social policies to promote 'race' and ethnic equality. Despite this, regional devolution has ensured that the responses to these federal initiatives at the provincial level have been varied and that developments in practice have been uneven. In this paper, we draw upon ethnographic data in an attempt to provide a sociological account of these regional differences. Focusing on the perspectives of a sample of 42 'active players' in the field of race equity education (i.e. teachers and youth workers, academics, university administrators, school board officials, equity officers, provincial government officials, consultants, grass-roots activists and representatives of various pressure groups), we compare and contrast the developments in theory, policy and practice in two Canadian provinces: Ontario and British Columbia. Throughout the paper, we underline the importance of grounded research, focusing on the part played by local political and historical conditions in both shaping and modifying the articulation and effects of federal policy.

AB  - Juvenile Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha were collected from May to June 1980 in seven nonnatal tributaries of the lower Fraser River in British Columbia, Canada. The juveniles were collected predominantly in pools and had migrated 0.4–6.5 km up the nonnatal tributaries to reach the rearing areas. In 1981, two of the tributaries, Nathan Creek and the Brunette River, were sampled every 2 weeks from late February to late June. During this period, the mean fork lengths of juvenile Chinook salmon increased from 45 to 80 mm in Nathan Creek and from 44 to 68 mm in the Brunette River. The use of nonnatal rearing areas is of importance to the survival and productivity of juvenile Chinook salmon in the Fraser River.

AB  - In past treaties, the Aboriginal people of Canada surrendered title to their lands in return for guarantees that their traditional ways of life would be protected. Since the 1950s, governments have reneged on these commitments in order to acquire more land and water for hydroelectric development. James B. Waldram examines this controversial topic through an analysis of the politics of hydroelectric dam construction in the Canadian Northwest, focusing on three Aboriginal communities in Manitoba and Saskatchewan. He argues that little has changed in our treatment of Aboriginal people in the past hundred years, when their resources are still appropriated by the government “for the common good.” Using archival materials, personal interviews and largely inaccessible documents and letters, Waldram highlights the clear parallel between the treatment of Aboriginal people in the negotiations and agreements that accompany hydro development with the treaty and scrip processes of the past century.

AB  - In June and August, 1985 field studies were conducted on the Nechako Riverto investigate the relationship between river discharge and reaerationcoeffients (K2). Dissolved gas and temperature data were collected, fromwhich reaeration coefficients were calculated. The calculations included aprocedure designed to account for variable gas solubilities caused by temperature changes within the "parcels" of water studied. Results arepresented along with earlier data reported by the International PacificSalmon Fisheries Commission and Environcon Ltd, and indicate that there is anonlinear relationship between K2 and discharge. K2 values for the upperreaches of the Nechako appear to increase with discharge up to a maximumvalue, then decrease as the discharge continues to rise. This relationshipshould be considered when selecting values of K2 for modelling dissolved gaslevels in the Nechako river.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Yim, Deanna
AB  - "This thesis describes a community-based research project that was conducted in partnership with Tl'azt'en Nation and the co-managed John Prince Research Forest. The purpose of the research was to identify, develop, and verify Tl'azt'en environmental measures for five traditional use activities: talo ha'hut'en - fishing salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), huda ha'hut'en - hunting moose (Alces alces), tsa ha tsayilh sula - trapping beaver (Castor canadensis), duje hoonayin - picking huckleberries (Vaccinium membranaceum), and yoo ba ningwus hunult'o - gathering soapberries (Shepherdia canadensis) for medicinal use. The process of developing Aboriginal environmental measures was participatory and iterative. I worked in partnership with two teams of Tl'azt'en community members, including Elders and traditional land users. The central methods used in our framework included: focus groups, workshops, one-on-one interviews and Photovoice. Our participatory research approach was evaluated throughout the course of the project and comprehensively at the end of the project by Tl'azt'en team members, researchers, and research assistants. This iterative evaluation process fostered an adaptive outlook and ensured that our methodology was culturally appropriate and meaningful. Evaluation results revealed how participant satisfaction, personal development, independence, and the building of relationships contributed to sustained participation and the achievement of project objectives. Overall, 252 Tl'azt'en environmental measures were developed in this project for our five focal traditional use activities and two inductively identified environmental monitoring themes: monitoring environmental change across Tl'azt'en Nation traditional territory and monitoring community adherence to Tl'azt'enne traditional environmental land use methods and principles. A prioritized subset of these measures will be applied in the future through a Tl'azt'en community-based environmental monitoring initiative on the John Prince Research Forest. Applying these Aboriginal environmental measures through community-based environmental monitoring can strengthen the co-management partnership between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia; community-based environmental monitoring builds the community into management and decision-making processes - ultimately contributing to co-management success."

AB  - Abstract Water level monitoring provides essential information about the condition of aquifers and their responses to water extraction, land-use change, and climatic variability. It is important to have a spatially distributed, long-term monitoring well network for sustainable groundwater resource management. Community-based monitoring involving citizen scientists provides an approach to complement existing government-run monitoring programs. This article demonstrates the feasibility of establishing a large-scale water level monitoring network of private water supply wells using an example from Rocky View County (3900 km2) in Alberta, Canada. In this network, community volunteers measure the water level in their wells, and enter these data through a web-based data portal, which allows the public to view and download these data. The close collaboration among the university researchers, county staff members, and community volunteers enabled the successful implementation and operation of the network for a 5-year pilot period, which generated valuable data sets. The monitoring program was accompanied by education and outreach programs, in which the educational materials on groundwater were developed in collaboration with science teachers from local schools. The methodology used in this study can be easily adopted by other municipalities and watershed stewardship groups interested in groundwater monitoring. As governments are starting to rely increasingly on local municipalities and conservation authorities for watershed management and planning, community-based groundwater monitoring provides an effective and affordable tool for sustainable water resources management.

In regions undergoing rapid change, it is difficult to effectively monitor and quantify these impacts at local to regional scales. In Vancouver, British Columbia, one of the most rapidly urbanizing areas in Canada, 750 measurements were taken from a total of 81 unique sampling sites representing 49 streams located in urban, forest, and agricultural-dominant watersheds at a frequency of up to 12 times per year between 2013 and 2016. Dissolved nitrate (NO3-N) and phosphate (PO4-P) concentrations, turbidity, water temperature, pH and conductivity were measured by citizen scientists in addition to observations of hydrology, vegetation, land use, and visible stream impacts. Land cover was mapped at a 15-m resolution using Landsat 8 OLI imagery and used to determine dominant land cover for each watershed in which a sample was recorded. Regional, seasonal, and catchment-type trends in measurements were determined using statistical analyses. The relationships of nutrients to land cover varied seasonally and on a catchment-type basis. Nitrate showed seasonal highs in winter and lows in summer, though phosphate had less seasonal variation. Overall, nitrate concentrations were positively associated to agriculture and deciduous forest and negatively associated with coniferous forest. In contrast, phosphate concentrations were positively associated with agricultural, deciduous forest, and disturbed land cover and negatively associated with urban land cover. Both urban and agricultural land cover were significantly associated with an increase in water conductivity. Increased forest land cover was associated with better water quality, including lower turbidity, conductivity, and water temperature. This study showed the importance of high resolution sampling in understanding seasonal and spatial dynamics of stream water quality, made possible with the large number of measurements taken with the help of trained volunteers. The results underscore the value of citizen science in freshwater research.

AB  - Over the past two decades, researchers at Natural Resources Canada's Canadian Forest Service, in collaboration with the Australian National University (ANU), Environment Canada (EC), and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), have made a concerted effort to produce spatial climate products (i.e., spatial models and grids) covering both Canada and the United States for a wide variety of climate variables and time steps (from monthly to daily), and across a range of spatial resolutions. Here we outline the method used to generate the spatial models, detail the array of products available and how they may be accessed, briefly describe some of the usage and impact of the models, and discuss anticipated further developments. Our initial motivation in developing these models was to support forestry-related applications. They have since been utilized by a wider range of agencies and researchers. This article is intended to further raise awareness of the strengths and weaknesses of these climate models and to facilitate their wider application.

AB  - Water temperature controls many biochemical and ecological processes in rivers, and theoretically depends on multiple factors. Here we formulate a model to predict daily averaged river water temperature as a function of air temperature and discharge, with the latter variable being more relevant in some specific cases (e.g., snowmelt-fed rivers, rivers impacted by hydropower production). The model uses a hybrid formulation characterized by a physically based structure associated with a stochastic calibration of the parameters. The interpretation of the parameter values allows for better understanding of river thermal dynamics and the identification of the most relevant factors affecting it. The satisfactory agreement of different versions of the model with measurements in three different rivers (root mean square error smaller than 1oC, at a daily timescale) suggests that the proposed model can represent a useful tool to synthetically describe medium- and long-term behavior, and capture the changes induced by varying external conditions.

AB  - The economic development-environmental protection dichotomy is an out-dated construct. A 21st century approach to the world's water problems is progressively being developed by researchers and practitioners, who are combining traditional and ecosystem-based engineering systems to yield cost-effective solutions. Given the continuing and widespread loss of ecological services and functions, water security in a multi-generational, SDG context requires a meaningful, global commitment to redirect the current downward trajectory in both (i) the state of the world's ecosystems and the services they provide to society, and (ii) our collective level of stewardship of these important resources. Achieving sustainable water security will require overcoming strategic challenges related to protected areas, ecosystem-based solutions research, water observatories and expanded technical readiness. It also needs to address other limitations and demands related to water infrastructure, economies, human settlements and water quality, sanitation and health. Four globally significant actions can support the adoption of more efficient and sustainable water futures: green infrastructure watershed banks, an accelerated global research and solutions program, a new global water-ecosystem services observatory, and an improved technical capacity/workforce development initiative. Finally, the engagement of relevant stakeholders from academia, government, the private sector and civil society are needed to ensure that humankind will be able to meet its water security goals and commitments, including those expressed in the sustainable development agenda.

AB  - Protecting the world’s freshwater resources requires diagnosing threats over a broad range of scales, from global to local. Here we present the first worldwide synthesis to jointly consider human and biodiversity perspectives on water security using a spatial framework that quantifies multiple stressors and accounts for downstream impacts. We find that nearly 80% of the world’s population is exposed to high levels of threat to water security. Massive investment in water technology enables rich nations to offset high stressor levels without remedying their underlying causes, whereas less wealthy nations remain vulnerable. A similar lack of precautionary investment jeopardizes biodiversity, with habitats associated with 65% of continental discharge classified as moderately to highly threatened. The cumulative threat framework offers a tool for prioritizing policy and management responses to this crisis, and underscores the necessity of limiting threats at their source instead of through costly remediation of symptoms in order to assure global water security for both humans and freshwater biodiversity.

AU  - Karl, Jason W.

AB  - Location information in published studies represents an untapped resource for literature discovery, applicable to a range of domains. The ability to easily discover scientific articles from specific places, nearby locales, or similar (but geographically separate) areas worldwide is important for advancing science and addressing global sustainability challenges. However, the thematic and not geographic nature of current search tools makes location-based searches challenging and inefficient. Manually geolocating studies is labor intensive, and place-name recognition algorithms have performed poorly due to prevalence of irrelevant place names in scientific articles. These challenges have hindered past efforts to create map-based literature search tools. Thus, automated approaches are needed to sustain article georeferencing efforts. Common pattern-matching algorithms (parsers) can be used to identify and extract geographic coordinates from the text of published articles. Pattern-matching algorithms (geoparsers) were developed using regular expressions and lexical parsing and tested their performance against sets of full-text articles from multiple journals that were manually scanned for coordinates. Both geoparsers performed well at recognizing and extracting coordinates from articles with accuracy ranging from 85.1% to 100%, and the lexical geoparser performing marginally better. Omission errors (i.e. missed coordinates) were 0% to 14.9% for the regular expression geoparser and 0% to 10.3% for the lexical geoparser. Only a single commission error (i.e. erroneous coordinate) was encountered with the lexical geoparser. The ability to automatically identify and extract location information from published studies opens new possibilities for transforming scientific literature discovery and supporting novel research.

Despite of its short history, georeferenced media has been attracting attentions from several major research communities of Computer Vision, Multimedia, Digital Libraries and KDD. This paper provides a comprehensive survey on recent research and applications on online georeferenced media. Specifically, the survey focuses on four aspects: (1) organizing and browsing georeferenced media resources, (2) mining semantic/social knowledge from georeferenced media, (3) learning landmarks in the world, and (4) estimating geographic location of a photo. Furthermore, based on the current technical achievements, open research issues and challenges are identified, and directions that can lead to compelling applications are suggested.

AB  - Citizen participation in environmental monitoring is not a new idea. However, recent developments in information and communication technologies (ICT), such as the social web and the miniaturization of sensors, have created new opportunities to promote citizen participation in environmental monitoring. The analysis of existing citizen initiatives that use ICT tools, identified the need for a framework conceptualizing ways to increase the contribution of volunteered geographic data in environmental monitoring. Environmental Collaborative Monitoring Networks (ECMN) are proposed in this paper as a framework that combines the concepts of traditional environmental monitoring networks with the ideals of the open source movement. Such framework can guide the creation of fixed and mobile monitoring networks and is organized based on three building blocks: (1) Motivated Citizens; (2) Sensing Devices; and (3) Back-End Information Infrastructure. To illustrate the issues involved in the implementation of the building blocks of ECMN, the Senses@Watch project is presented, which explored the use of sensory data as a source of monitoring data.

AB  - Citizen science websites are emerging as a common way for volunteers to collect and report geographic ecological data. Engaging the public in citizen science is challenging and, when involving online participation, data entry, and map use, becomes even more daunting. Given these new challenges, citizen science websites must be easy to use, result in positive overall satisfaction for many different users, support many different tasks, and ensure data quality. To begin reaching these goals, we built a geospatially enabled citizen science website, evaluated its usability, and gained experience by working with and listening to citizens using the website. We sought to determine general perceptions, discover potential problems, and iteratively improve website features. Although the website was rated positively overall, map-based tasks identified a wide range of problems. Given our results, we redesigned the website, improved the content, enhanced the ease of use, simplified the map interface, and added features. We discuss citizen science websites in relation to online Public Participation Geographic Information Systems, examine the role(s) websites may play in the citizen science research model, discuss how citizen science research advances GIScience, and offer guidelines to improve citizen-based web mapping applications.

AB  - Although the geographical context of ecological observations shapes ecological theory, the global distribution of ecological studies has never been analyzed. Here, we document the global distribution and context (protected status, biome, anthrome, and net primary productivity) of 2573 terrestrial study sites reported in recent publications (2004–2009) of 10 highly cited ecology journals. We find evidence of several geographical biases, including overrepresentation of protected areas, temperate deciduous woodlands, and wealthy countries. Even within densely settled or agricultural regions, ecologists tend to study “natural” fragments. Such biases in trendsetting journals may limit the scalability of ecological theory and hinder conservation efforts in the 75% of the terrestrial world where humans live and work.

AB  - Citizen engagement figures prominently on political agendas around the world. In this context, high hopes are pinned to open government, open data and ICT tools. At the same time, there are fears of a widening digital divide, where large groups of society are in danger of being excluded from societal processes, for example due to having difficulties in using the online tools provided. In this paper, we propose an approach that has the potential to address many key issues in this context (e.g. accessibility, complexity, engagement). It relies on space and time as common integrators, and uses interactive augmented geo-visualizations to facilitate citizen engagement. We report on key challenges that need to be overcome to realize this approach and on initial progress towards this goal. We describe a set of prototypical tools aimed at supporting citizen engagement in the envisioned way, and discuss the approach as well as its potentials, issues and challenges in detail. Initial experiences and results indicate that our approach is not only technically feasible but it can also empower citizens to more effectively engage with societal and governmental processes.

AB  - It is easier to search the globe for research on the genes of a local plant than it is to find local research on that plant’s ecology. As a result, ecologists are often unaware of published local research and unlikely to find relevant studies from similar environments worldwide. Location information in ecological studies can be harnessed to enable geographic knowledge searches and could be standardized to make searches more fruitful. To demonstrate this potential, we developed the JournalMap Web site (www.journalmap.org). Easy access to geographic distributions of knowledge opens new possibilities for using ecological research to detect and interpret ecological patterns, evaluate current ecological knowledge, and facilitate knowledge creation. We call on journals and publishers to support standard reporting of study locations in publications and metadata, and we advocate georeferencing past studies.

AB  - The increasing awareness of the complexity and uncertainty of environmental processes is changing the role of information production to support decision-making. Monitoring systems need to gather reliable information, adopting a multi-scale and integrated approach. Using exclusively technical monitoring methods to collect the information could result in unsustainable monitoring costs. In order to minimize the costs and to address the scale issue, the integration of local and technical knowledge is proposed in this work. For the implementation of this approach, a tool based on the use of fuzzy logic and geographic information system (GIS) technologies was developed. The willingness of the local community to participate in monitoring activities was ensured by keeping these activities as simple and close to local knowledge as possible. The fuzzy GIS-based system enhances both the comprehensibility of the local knowledge for the decision-makers and its reliability, making it usable for the decision-making process. The tool was developed to support soil salinity monitoring in the lower Amudarya River Basin in Uzbekistan.

TI  - Negative Capability: Of Provinces and Lands Reserved for the Indians
T2  - Indigenous Law Journal
TY  - journalArticle
AU  - Wilkens, Kerry
VL  - 1
AB  - Canada’s constitution assigns to the provinces general power to govern thelands and resources located within their boundaries but reserves to the fed-eral order of government the authority in relation to “Lands reserved for theIndians.” Under Canadian law, the mere existence of this federal powerimposes substantial restrictions on provincial authority to regulate theselands and the interests in them. How, then, is one to determine which, if any,provincial measures having to do with land have legal force on, or in appli-cation to, such lands? And which lands, in the end, are subject, under main-stream Canadian law, to provincial, and which exclusively to federal, au-thority?Release of the Delgamuukw decision in late 1997 made the task of an-swering the first of these questions more urgent and the task of answeringthe second more difficult. We now know that “Lands reserved for the Indi-ans” include not only Indian reserves set aside deliberately but all landssubject to valid Indian claims of Aboriginal title. We do not yet know whichlands those are, but we do know that non-Aboriginal people believe theyhave rights and interests, derived from provincial authorities, in many of thelands that are in dispute. The legal status of those putative rights and inter-ests is now open to question.This article explores these issues from within the matrix of existing Ca-nadian constitutional law. It argues that provinces, acting as such, have nopower to determine or to regulate matters relating to the ownership, posses-sion, occupation, use or disposition of Indian lands, even in the absence ofcountervailing federal measures, and it doubts that any mechanism now ex-ists in Canadian law to extend, for practical purposes, the reach of provin-cial measures to such lands. It suggests a test for use in ascertaining whichprovincial measures generally can, and which cannot, apply on lands re-served for the Indians; it wonders, on constitutional grounds, how provinciallaw can authorize enforcement on such lands of provincial measures that doapply there; and it documents some of the challenges now facing both Abo-riginal and non-Aboriginal peoples interested in clarifying which lands areIndian lands and which are not.

AU  - Yinka Dene ‘uza’hné
AB  - The Yinka Dene ‘uza’hné from Nadleh Whut’en and Stellat’en formally enacted the Yinka Dene‘Uza’hné Surface Water Management Policy and Yinka Dene ‘Uza’hné Guide to Surface WaterQuality Standards (Appendix 1). Our Territories are located in north-central British Columbia andencompasses an area of about 500,000 ha in the vicinity of Fraser Lake, B.C. (Appendix 2). We havebeen governing our Territories in accordance with the Yinka Dene legal tradition for thousands ofyears. There are several distinct elements of our governance system and legal tradition. Inparticular, our peoples are affiliated with various clans that include hereditary leaders known as‘uza’hné. We also have land and resource management territories known as keyah associated withextended family units. The primary institution for governing keyah and clans is through ourpotlatch system of governance known as bahlats.Prior to contact with settlers, this interconnected system determined legal obligations and authorityfor stewardship of and access to lands, waters and natural resources to ensure that they benefitpresent and future generations. After contact, our governance system and legal tradition haspersisted and evolved, responding to developments such as the imposition of Indian reserves andbands, a provincial trapline registration system that did not necessarily correspond to keyah andCanada’s former ban on conducting bahlats. We continue to apply our laws, including through thebahlats, and continue to recognize our ‘uza’hné, keyah and clan membership.The relationship between our culture and governance and the waters and fish in our Territories isinextricable, functioning like a two-way street. Harvesting fish is a key cultural and economicpractice that supports the clans, bahlats, keyah and ‘uza’hné. At the same time, the system of clans,bahlats, keyah and ‘uza’hné forms the framework for the governance and management of use ofwaters and fish for the benefit of present and future generations, including responsibilities to makedecisions regarding protection and stewardship. We continue to undertake monitoring, regulationand enforcement activities in keeping with these obligations to the best of our ability.Section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982 recognizes and affirms our Aboriginal title and rightsthroughout our Territories, including our governance and management rights and obligations.Nadleh Whut’en and Stellat’en have entered into various government-to-government agreementswith B.C. whereby the Province recognizes our Aboriginal title and rights, and our authority andjurisdiction to make decisions based on our own laws, policies, responsibilities and protocols.

SN  - 978-1-55380-035-4
AB  - This warm-hearted memoir tells the story of the dream of many North Americans: to throw up a dull job and journey into the wilderness to live off the land. Sunny Wright does exactly that when she decides at age twenty-eight to quit working at a “man-sized job for a female wage” in a Vancouver sawmill. With her young daughter Lisa and friend Betty, they sell off everything from their urban existence and outfit themselves with two trucks full of goods for the journey in to northern B.C in search of a place to live. They have never even gone camping before, but they are determined to succeed, and they do. After much searching they find land near Vanderhoof and begin the hard but joy-filled labour of constructing their own house, their own barn and setting up as subsistence farmers. Eventually they will learn how to run a bootleg still for extra money and will become famous in the area for the dogs they raise and the winter trips they take by dogsled. This is a book that readers can enjoy as they live alongside Sunny, Betty and Lisa in the bush, watching them learn to build log houses, make friends with the fiercely individualistic people of the back country, survive the desperately cold winters and enjoy the independence of rural life. The volume includes many black-and-white photos of their life in the bush.

AB  - "From the 1920s to 1952, George and Else Seel lived about sixty kilometres south of Burns Lake near the small farming settlement of Wistaria on the western shore of Ootsa Lake. Like many early twentieth century settlers whomigrated to BC's central interior, the Seels came in search of opportunity and prosperity, but the harsh environment posed challenges they could not have imagined.The community was remote and the winters were long, but eventually, along with their fellow settlers, they learnedhow to live and thrive in this new world. They developed aclose connection to the land; helped each other in times of need; and established collaborative relationships with the First Nations people who lived around them. The coupleand their family lived at Ootsa Lake through the prosperity of the late 1920s; subsisted during the Depression of the 1930s; and experienced a rejuvenation during World War II and its aftermath. George died in 1950, but Else remained until 1952, when their property was flooded by the Nechako Reservoir as part of the Alcan project and she was uprooted, like many of the Ootsa Lake settlers and Cheslatta First Nations people. George had spent his life as a prospector and trapper and Else as a published writer. Together they documented a rich story of pioneer life in a small northern BC community before the demand for hydro power changed their life and the valley forever." -- Provided by publisher.

AU  - Wood, June
SN  - 978-1-894974-27-1
AB  - The indomitable spirit of Bert Irvine is at the heart of Nechako Country, a story that provides a glimpse into a simpler world in simpler times. After Bert moved his young family from Barrhead in northwestern Alberta to Vanderhoof in central British Columbia, the upper Nechako country and Nechako River became integral parts of their lives. Bert's life was and still is intertwined with the wilderness, and the country itself is a major player in this tale. Spanning 1934 to 2005, a period of unprecedented and fast-paced change, the story focuses largely on the '50s and '60s. As the wilderness way of life continues to be replaced by a new world of high technology, and the wilderness itself is pushed back and badly bruised, Nechako Country provides a window into the past and a lifestyle that has all but vanished. In part the story of one man's journey through life as a trapper, guide-outfitter and jack-of-all trades, it is also a history of the upper Nechako valley, its people and the tortured Nechako River, the lifeblood of this beautiful area.

"Nechako" is an anglicization of netʃa koh, its name in the Carrier language meaning "big river". The Nechako River's main tributaries are the Stuart River, which enters about 45 kilometres east of Vanderhoof; the Endako River; the Chilako River, which enters about 15 kilometres west of Prince George; and the Nautley River, a short stream that drains Fraser Lake. Other tributaries include the Cheslatta River, which drains Cheslatta Lake and enters the Nechako at the foot of the Nechako Canyon via Cheslatta Falls, near Kenney Dam and the Nechako Reservoir.

Witsuwit'en presence on the land before settlement, how and why northern interior British Columbia was settled, Indigenous displacement and the formation of Indiantown, the impacts of the Indian Act (including differential access to health care, discriminatory policies around alcohol, and loss ofIndian status through marriage), economic shifts over time, and attempts at community planning, ending with the destruction of Indiantown and a look forward to Smithers's future. While it does not provide detailed methodology for data collection and analysis, the book would be teachable in a variety of social science contexts, including geography, First Nations and Indigenous studies, anthropology, history, and sociology, at both undergraduate and graduate levels.

AB  - Serpentinization of ultramaﬁc rocks drives geochemical exchange between the hydrosphere, biosphere and lithosphere in surﬁcial environments and at depth. Precious metals are implicated in these hydration reactions because of the well-known association between peridotite-hosted Au and placer platinumgroup mineral (PGM) deposits sourced from serpentinized ophiolite complexes at surface. However, the distribution of precious metals in mantle rocks and their mode of occurrence at the onset of serpentinization are not well understood because early-stage features are typically obliterated with progressive hydration. Herein we report electron probe microanalysis (EPMA) and laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICPMS) spot and mapping results for a suite of base metal sulphide (pentlandite, pyrrhotite, chalcopyrite), native metal (Cu and Fe) and Ni-Fe alloy (awaruite) from variably serpentinized peridotite and pyroxenite (Late Permian to Early Triassic Nahlin ophiolite, Cache Creek terrane; Atlin, British Columbia, Canada). Pentlandite and pyrrhotite occur with magmatic clinopyroxene and Cr-spinel as ultraﬁne inclusions (few mm) and as coarser interstitial base metal sulphides ( 200 mm) that are enveloped by native metal (Cu and Fe) and Ni-Fe alloy. Because native Fe- and awaruite-bearing mineral assemblages require reduced and/or low-fS2 conditions, we suggest that these replacement textures document destabilization of base metal sulphide phases during the conversion of olivine to serpentine and magnetite. Desulphurization reactions decoupled precious metals from relict pentlandite at the microscale, with Ag, Pd, Pt and Au partitioning from sulphides into both awaruite and native metal (Cu and Fe) at concentrations up to 100s of ppm. New high-resolution LA-ICPMS maps also point to clusters of ultraﬁne PGM, tellurides, bismuthides and metal alloys that were either remobilized within the serpentinized mesh and/or represent the completely desulphidized product of ultraﬁne, intergranular base metal sulphide. Other PGE (Os and Ir) are mostly hosted within relict pentlandite and/or pyrrhotite that were preserved during incomplete desulphurization, along with lesser microscale remobilization of these elements into ultraﬁne veins. New whole-rock PGE (nickel-sulphide ﬁre-assay; NiS-FA) results demonstrate that precious metal remobilization was limited to the microscale during the earliest stages of serpentinization, which, in the case of Au, is consistent with its low solubility within such reduced, low fS2 ﬂuids. Precious metal mobility during the early stages of serpentinization may therefore depend on the stability of Ni-Fe alloy, native metal (Cu and Fe) and PGM. Progressive serpentinization, complete replacement of olivine and destabilization of the reduced, low-fS2 mineral assemblage likely represents an important process to liberate, transport and concentrate precious metals within more oxidized and/or sulphur-bearing ﬂuids in surﬁcial and deep subduction environments.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine whether menstrual cups are a viable alternative to tampons. DesignRandomized controlled trial. SettingPrince George, Victoria, and Vancouver, BC. ParticipantsA total of 110 women aged 19 to 40 years who had previously used tampons as their main method of menstrual management. InterventionParticipants were randomized into 2 groups, a tampon group and a menstrual cup group. Using online diaries, participants tracked 1 menstrual cycle using their regular method and 3 menstrual cycles using the method of their allocated group. Main outcome measuresOverall satisfaction; secondary outcomes included discomfort, urovaginal infection, cost, and waste. ResultsForty-seven women in each group completed the final survey, 5 of whom were subsequently excluded from analysis (3 from the tampon group and 2 from the menstrual cup group). Overall satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale was higher for the menstrual cup group than for the tampon group (mean [standard deviation] score 5.4 [1.5] vs 5.0 [1.0], respectively; P = .04). Approximately 91% of women in the menstrual cup group said they would continue to use the cup and recommend it to others. Women used a median of 13 menstrual products per cycle, or 169 products per year, which corresponds to approximately 771 248 400 products used annually in Canada. Estimated cost for tampon use was $37.44 a year (similar to the retail cost of 1 menstrual cup). Subjective vaginal discomfort was initially higher in the menstrual cup group, but the discomfort decreased with continued use. There was no significant difference in physician-diagnosed urovaginal symptoms between the 2 groups. ConclusionBoth of the menstrual management methods evaluated were well tolerated by subjects. Menstrual cups are a satisfactory alternative to tampons and have the potential to be a sustainable solution to menstrual management, with moderate cost savings and much-reduced environmental effects compared with tampons.

AB  - Anthropogenic activity imposes increasing pressure on wildlife populations globally; these pressures can affect habitat suitability and function, modify wildlife space use, and influence population viability. Native mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus) populations can be negatively affected by anthropogenic disturbance and modify their space use in response to land development and recreational activity. From 2018 to 2020, we studied space use of mountain goats northeast of Smithers, British Columbia, Canada, an area that is subject to increasing anthropogenic development and yearlong recreational activities. We aimed to generate models that would improve our ability to identify habitat for mountain goats relative to existing survey data and established ungulate winter ranges. Using resource selection function (RSF) analyses generated from global positioning system (GPS) collar data, we identified influential habitat covariates and compared these covariates and RSF values to existing habitat models. Additionally, we compared the extent to which our models were congruent with existing resource selection probability functions, were congruent with aerial survey data, and overlapped existing ungulate winter ranges previously derived from predictive models inside and outside of the study area. Overall, our models noted higher RSF values among GPS data relative to aerial survey data for winter months, while results for summer habitats were comparable. In extending our RSFs outside of the study area and evaluating the overlap with ungulate winter ranges in adjacent areas, values were similar, albeit lower, as is expected given that the models were developed elsewhere. Ultimately, these models, combined with existing methods, improve the accuracy and reliability of identified, important areas of habitat for mountain goats. We recommend that the RSF models generated here be used in conjunction with aerial survey data and existing methods to delineate ungulate winter ranges for mountain goats in similar eco-regions in British Columbia. The models developed here support existing methods that have been used to delineate or validate ungulate winter ranges for mountain goats in British Columbia and help facilitate mitigation measures to support the continued use of important winter habitat and significant landscape features that play a role in ensuring population viability and resilience through time.

AB  - IntroductionMost hospital urine toxicology screens detect a fixed, limited set of common substances. These tests are fast and accurate but may miss emerging trends in substance use in the community and clinical acumen alone is insufficient for identifying new substances.MethodsThis prospective cohort study examined de-identified urine specimens obtained from patients visiting the Emergency Department (ED) at Prince George’s Hospital Center (PGHC), between October 15, 2019 to November 6, 2019 and tested positive for one or more substances. The Emergency Department Drug Surveillance System (EDDS) collects quarterly exports from de-identified electronic health records (EHRs) containing urinalysis results for drug related ED visits. We performed a feasibility study of a new urine specimen submission by collecting a stratified sample of 151 urine specimens from PGHC ED patients. The specimens were tested for 240 drugs using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This paper presents a comparison between the PGHC and expanded testing results.ResultsThe expanded urinalysis panel found more cocaine (37% vs. 20%; p < 0.01) and benzodiazepine positives (21% vs. 11%; p < 0.05) than would have been detected by the hospital screen. Additionally, the expanded toxicology panel identified fentanyl in 4–14% of the samples.ConclusionThe EHR data submitted to EDDS from the hospital urine toxicology screen correctly identified hospital substance use patterns over the approximate 1 month study period. The expanded testing also uncovered drugs that the hospital might consider adding to their routine screen. EDDS is a feasible system for monitoring and confirming recent substance use trends among ED patients

DNA polymerase gene sequences have been demonstrated to be useful for inferring genetic relatedness among dsDNA viruses. We have adopted this approach to examine the relatedness among natural isolates of two uncharacterized caterpillar-infecting baculoviruses, Malacosoma californicum pluviale nucleopolyhedrovirus (McplMNPV) and Malacosoma disstria nucleopolyhedrovirus (MadiMNPV), which infect two closely related host species with little to no cross-infectivity. We designed two degenerate primers (BVP1 and BVP2) based on protein motifs conserved among baculoviruses. McplMNPV and MadiMNPV viral DNA was obtained from naturally infected caterpillars collected from geographically distinct sites in the Southern Gulf Islands and Prince George regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sequencing of 0.9 kb PCR amplicons from six McplMNPV and six MadiMNPV isolates obtained from a total of eight sites, revealed very low nucleotide variation among McplMNPV isolates (99.2–100% nucleotide identity) and among MadiMNPV isolates (98.9–100% nucleotide identity). Greater nucleotide variation was observed between viral isolates from the two diﬀerent caterpillar species (only 84.7–86.1% nucleotide identity). Both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses support placement of McplMNPV and MadiMNPV in a clade that is distinct from other groups of baculoviruses.

AB  - BackgroundThis study provides experimental evidence for biologically induced precipitation of magnesium carbonates, specifically dypingite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·5H2O), by cyanobacteria from an alkaline wetland near Atlin, British Columbia. This wetland is part of a larger hydromagnesite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O) playa. Abiotic and biotic processes for magnesium carbonate precipitation in this environment are compared. ResultsField observations show that evaporation of wetland water produces carbonate films of nesquehonite (MgCO3·3H2O) on the water surface and crusts on exposed surfaces. In contrast, benthic microbial mats possessing filamentous cyanobacteria (Lyngbya sp.) contain platy dypingite (Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·5H2O) and aragonite. Bulk carbonates in the benthic mats (δ13C avg. = 6.7‰, δ18O avg. = 17.2‰) were isotopically distinguishable from abiotically formed nesquehonite (δ13C avg. = 9.3‰, δ18O avg. = 24.9‰). Field and laboratory experiments, which emulated natural conditions, were conducted to provide insight into the processes for magnesium carbonate precipitation in this environment. Field microcosm experiments included an abiotic control and two microbial systems, one containing ambient wetland water and one amended with nutrients to simulate eutrophic conditions. The abiotic control developed an extensive crust of nesquehonite on its bottom surface during which [Mg2+] decreased by 16.7% relative to the starting concentration. In the microbial systems, precipitation occurred within the mats and was not simply due to the capturing of mineral grains settling out of the water column. Magnesium concentrations decreased by 22.2% and 38.7% in the microbial systems, respectively. Laboratory experiments using natural waters from the Atlin site produced rosettes and flakey globular aggregates of dypingite precipitated in association with filamentous cyanobacteria dominated biofilms cultured from the site, whereas the abiotic control again precipitated nesquehonite. ConclusionMicrobial mats in the Atlin wetland create ideal conditions for biologically induced precipitation of dypingite and have presumably played a significant role in the development of this natural Mg-carbonate playa. This biogeochemical process represents an important link between the biosphere and the inorganic carbon pool.

AB  - Cold seeps, where seepage of hydrocarbon-rich fluids occurs in the sea floor, are sites that harbor highly specialized ecosystems associated with distinctive carbonate sediments. Although their Mesozoic record is scarce and patchy, it commonly includes dimerelloid rhynchonellide brachiopods. Here we report a monospecific assemblage of Anarhynchia from a limestone boulder of early Pliensbachian (Early Jurassic) age in the Inklin Formation of the Whitehorse Trough in the Stikine terrane, from a locality at Atlin Lake in northern British Columbia. Specimens are among the largest known Mesozoic brachiopods, up to 9 cm in length, and described here as Anarhynchia smithi n. sp. Early precipitated carbonate cement phases of the limestone have carbon isotopic composition highly depleted in 13 C, indicative of the influence of microbial oxidation of methane derived from a cold seep. Carbonate petrography of the banded-fibrous cement and other characteristic components supports this paleoenvironmental inference. Volcanogenic detrital grains in the matrix are indistinguishable from those in the sandstone layers in the siliciclastic sequence, suggesting that the seep carbonate is broadly coeval with the enclosing conglomerate. The new record extends the geographic range and species-level diversity of the genus, but supports its endemism to the East Pacific and membership in chemosynthesis-based ecosystems. The distribution of three distinct but congeneric species suggests that allopatric speciation occurred at separate sites along the active margin of western North America and Anarhynchia was restricted to seep and vent habitats in the Early Jurassic.

AB  - A cyanobacteria dominated consortium collected from an alkaline wetland located near Atlin, British Columbia, Canada accelerated the precipitation of platy hydromagnesite [Mg5(CO3)4(OH)2·4H2O] in a linear ﬂow-through experimental model wetland. The concentration of magnesium decreased rapidly within 2 m of the inﬂow point of the 10-m-long (∼1.5 m2) bioreactor. The change in water chemistry was monitored over two months along the length of the channel. Carbonate mineralization was associated with extra-cellular polymeric substances in the nutrient-rich upstream portion of the bioreactor, while the lower part of the system, which lacked essential nutrients, did not exhibit any hydromagnesite precipitation. A mass balance calculation using the water chemistry data produced a carbon sequestration rate of 33.34 t of C/ha per year. Amendment of the nutrient deﬁciency would intuitively allow for increased carbonation activity. Optimization of this process will have application as a sustainable mining practice by mediating magnesium carbonate precipitation in ultramaﬁc mine tailings storage facilities.

AB  - Increasing watershed sediment yields is an important problem in Africa, but the sources of these sediment yields have only very rarely been investigated. This study therefore aims to discriminate subsurface and surface sources of fine-grained sediments in a representative mesoscale (580 km2) West African savanna watershed. We used a sediment source fingerprinting approach for source apportionment including geochemical and radionuclide (137Cs, 210Pbex, and 7Be) composite signatures where 7Be was used as a tracer for the first time in the African environment. Two field campaigns were conducted collecting a total of 258 geochemical and 66 isotope samples. We found that subsurface source categories, dominantly river bank, contributed an unexpected high share of 43% (geochemistry) and 45% (radionuclides) to the sampled fine-grained sediments. Pairwise comparison of the averaged frequency distributions for predicted source proportions using five geochemical signatures with the frequency distribution generated using the single radionuclide signature suggested that the two distributions are not statistically different. Extrapolating our measured contribution of subsurface erosion to areas with similar yields in comparable environmental settings, we can assume that subsurface sources are an important component of sediment loss across large areas of West Africa. Subsurface erosion, primarily associated with bank rather than gully erosion, is likely to increase in the future with projected rises in run-off due to land use and climate change. Source tracing studies need to be undertaken more widely across Africa to help mitigation planning for sediment-related and land degradation problems.

AB  - We recovered a spontaneous albino strain from ascospores of Ceratocystis resinifera, a sapstain fungus that grows deeply and rapidly in freshly felled conifer trees. This albino strain, named Kasper, was tested for its ability to prevent discoloration of spruce sapwood caused by wild-type sapstain fungi and compared with Cartapip 97, a commercially available biological control agent of sapstain in lodgepole pine and red pine logs. In a laboratory trial, Kasper reduced sapstain of white spruce logs as much as 94.4% and was more efficient than Cartapip 97. In field trials conducted in an area north of Québec City, Kasper reduced sapstain of black spruce as much as 80%. In three of four field trials, Kasper was significantly more efficient than Cartapip 97 in reducing sapstain development. The exception was encountered in a 2003 trial conducted in a sawmill yard where Kasper did not reduce sapstain. In a field trial conducted in western Canada, at Aleza Lake forest near Prince George, Kasper almost totally prevented the development of sapstain, even after 24 weeks. These results suggest albino strains derived from C. resinifera might be an additional source of potential biocontrol agents against sapstain.

AB  - In August 2014, the Mount Polley Mine tailings dam was breached, releasing millions of cubic metres of tailings water and tailings into Polley Lake, Quesnel Lake, and Hazeltine Creek in British Columbia (BC), Canada. To date, no assessment has identified the communities impacted by this event, nor how they were impacted, from a social or health perspective. This qualitative study uses a community-based participatory research approach to identify (1) First Nations impacted by this incident and (2) impacts to Aboriginal health experienced by these communities. To address these gaps in knowledge, the First Nations Health Authority funded the project team to complete the first two phases of a health impact assessment. This work draws attention to the strong links between First Nations, the land and resources, culture, and associated health outcomes. In considering the importance of Aboriginal health and culturally appropriate health pathways, the project team identified 4 key impacts: environmental dispossession, emotional stress, altered dietary patterns, and changes in physical activity. The similarity in impacts associated with the Mount Polley tailings dam failure for many First Nations in BC is best understood through an in-depth understanding of the importance of the Fraser River as a source of salmon for their communities. This work documents the unidentified and unfulfilled need to ameliorate the extent of emotional trauma prompted by real or perceived threat to salmon health, a threat exacerbated by a lack of reliable information from trusted sources in the aftermath of the breach. Relevant recommendations are also provided.

AB  - The hydromagnesite-magnesite playas near Atlin, British Columba, Canada are unique Mg-carbonate depositional environments that have formed at Earth's surface since the end of the last deglaciation. This study elucidates the mechanisms, pathways, and rates of magnesite (MgCO3) formation in these near-surface environments, which are challenging to study in short-duration laboratory experiments because magnesite precipitation is extremely slow at low temperature. The Atlin playas, having formed over millennia, contain abundant magnesite as well as a suite of other Mg- and Ca-carbonate minerals. Mineralogical and textural evidence demonstrate that hydromagnesite [Mg-5(CO3)(4)(OH)(2)center dot 4H(2)O] forms at least in part through transformation of more hydrated phases, e.g., lansfordite (MgCO3 center dot 5H(2)O). Deposition of these hydrated Mg-carbonate minerals is limited by the evaporative flux, and thus, is effectively transport-controlled at the scale of the playas. Magnesite is a spatially distinct phase from hydromagnesite and its crystal morphology varies with depth indicating variable crystal growth mechanisms and precipitation rates. Particle size distributions and mineral abundance data indicate that magnesite formation is nucleation-limited. Furthermore, mineralogical data as well as stable and radiogenic isotope data support magnesite formation starting after the majority of hydromagnesite had been deposited likely resulting from long induction times and slow precipitation rates. Hydrated Mg-carbonate minerals precipitate relatively rapidly and control pore water chemistry while magnesite remains highly supersaturated, and thus, is reaction-controlled. This difference in controlling regime allows for magnesite abundance to increase over time without the loss of hydromagnesite such as through its transformation, which the data also does not support. We estimate rates of magnesite formation (nucleation + crystal growth) in the range of 10(-17) to 10(-16) mol/cm(2)/s over approximately 8000 years. This study helps to elucidate the geochemical conditions needed to form Mg-carbonate minerals in ancient and modern sedimentary environments and provides insights into facilitating long-term storage of anthropogenic CO2 within Mg-carbonate minerals.

AB  - The conservation of species at-risk has involved a wide range of recovery methods including population augmentation. Yet, there has been little formal evaluation of the efficacy of this potentially high risk and expensive approach. In the late 1990s, 32 mountain caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) were translocated to the Telkwa caribou herd in an effort to recover this declining population. We used Andersen-Gill survival models to explore the influence of forestry, linear features, and recreation on the survival of translocated and native caribou in the Telkwa herd as well as two control herds that had relatively little habitat disturbance and no translocation. We used location data from radio/GPS collars to monitor the mortality of individual caribou from the three populations over a 21-year period (1991-2012). Results suggested that forest harvest more negatively affected the survival of Telkwa caribou when compared to neighbouring herds and that translocated caribou were not predisposed to higher mortality relative to native caribou. Although the translocation effort stabilised the decline of the Telkwa caribou for a 10-year period, this herd has now declined to 22 individuals. Our research suggests that well managed translocation programs can result in the short-term stabilization or increase of small and declining populations of species at-risk. To achieve long-term recovery objectives, however, conservation strategies must address the underlying causes of decline. For woodland caribou in the mountains of western Canada, this requires managing anthropogenic disturbance to minimize densities of primary prey and their predators that act in concert to decrease the survival of adult caribou.

AB  - Multiple species and stocks of Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. have experienced large declines in the number of returning adults over a wide region of the Pacific Northwest due to poor marine survival (low smolt-to-adult survival rates). One possible explanation for reduced survival is thiamine deficiency. Thiamine (vitamin B-1) is an essential vitamin with an integral role in many metabolic processes, and thiamine deficiency is an important cause of salmonid mortality in the Baltic Sea and in the Laurentian Great Lakes. To assess this possibility, we (1) compared muscle thiamine content over time in a holding experiment using Fraser River (British Columbia) Sockeye Salmon O. nerka to establish whether adults that died during the holding period had lower thiamine levels than survivors, (2) measured infectious loads of multiple pathogens in held fish, and (3) measured egg thiamine content from four species of Pacific salmon collected on Fraser River spawning grounds. Chinook Salmon O. tshawytscha had the lowest egg thiamine, followed by Sockeye Salmon; however, egg thiamine concentrations were above levels known to cause overt fry mortality. Thiamine vitamers in the muscle of Fraser River adult Sockeye Salmon shifted over a 13-d holding period, with a precipitous decline in thiamine pyrophosphate (the active form of thiamine used in enzyme reactions) in surviving fish. Survivors also carried lower loads of Flavobacterium psychrophilum than fish that died during in the holding period. Although there is no evidence of thiamine deficiency in the adults studied, questions remain about possible thiamine metabolism-fish pathogen relationships that influence survival.

AB  - The paper explores money circulation in Medieval Rus early in the 12th century. While there is more than one publication on this subject, their authors did not pay sufficient attention to the period when the flow of the European denarii to Medieval Russia decreased and did not give due consideration to available numismatic material. The quantitative and qualitative analyses of the composition of Medieval Russia hoards have shown the role of foreign coins in this period. The data provided in the paper clearly demonstrate that silver struck coins, European denarii, primarily of Germanic origin, still dominated in circulation in Medieval Rus during the first decades of the 12th century. These coins can be referred to several subgroups. Apparently, it is these coins that the princely authorities had at their disposal to implement major construction projects such as the construction of the St. George Cathedral in the St. George's (Yuriev) Monastery in Novgorod.

AB  - Acidic deposition has caused severe surface water acidification in Europe and North America, but surface water acidification has not been systematically studied in Russia. Here we present the first detailed study on regional surface water acidification in European Russia (ER) and Western Siberia (WS) based on a survey of 367 lakes in a transect from the tundra to the steppe, which were investigated to explore the status and mechanism of surface water acidification. The variability of water chemistry is documented and discussed. HighpH and acid-neutralizing capacity (ANC) were observed for lakes in the southern region, indicating that surface water acidification does not occur here. Anthropogenic acidification occurs in the humid areas of both regions, being observed in 4.4% of ER and 8.2% of WS lakes. These tundra and taiga lakes are characterized by high transparency, low pH, and ANC with a high concentration of strong acid anions. The main factor leading to acidification in the ER lakes is sulfur emission from metal smelters whilst that in WS is acidification, likely associated with gas burning by oil production facilities. In the ER acid lakes, SO42- is dominant; this is in contrast to WS, where NO3- and Cl- are dominate. The influence of strong technogenic acids on the structure of organic components and their possibility to form a proton is discussed. The phenomenon of the increase in water acidification by organic acids and strong acids is explained. These results clearly show the effect of a number of factors that strengthen the acidity of water. Differences in the chemical composition of lakes of both regions, as well as differentiation by their acid properties, were statistically proved. Results of our research indicate the need to reduce emissions of acidic gases into the atmosphere.

The Kenney dam was built in the early 1950s to provide power to an aluminum smelter on the coast, owned by the Aluminum Company of Canada, now Rio Tinto Alcan. The provincial government at the time openly and actively courted the development through an aptly named piece of legislation called, An Act to Promote the

AB  - The political landscape of British Columbia has been characterized by divisiveness since Confederation. As outsized personalities from Amor De Cosmos to W.A.C. Bennett dominated the halls of power, militant radicals and reformers took to the streets and hustings. A Long Way to Paradise traces the evolution of political ideas from 1871 to 1972 to explore British Columbia’s journey to socio-political maturity, answering both why and how British Columbia became Canada’s most fractious province. Robert McDonald explains its classic left-right divide as a product of “common sense” liberalism that also shaped how British Columbians met the challenges of a modernizing world. McDonald tackles key questions: Why were the Liberal and Conservative parties obliterated in the 1950s? What can account for Bennett’s decades-long reign? And why did parties as diametrically opposed as Social Credit and the NDP succeed? This lively overview provides fresh insight into the fascinating story of provincial politics in Canada’s lotus land.

SN  - 978-0-88755-294-6 978-0-88755-292-2
AB  - Beginning with the Grand Rapids Dam in the 1960s, hydroelectric development has dramatically altered the social, political, and physical landscape of northern Manitoba. The Nelson River has been cut up into segments and fractured by a string of dams, for which the Churchill River had to be diverted and new inflow points from Lake Winnipeg created to manage their capacity. Historic mighty rapids have shrivelled into dry river beds. Manitoba Hydro's Keeyask dam and generating station will expand the existing network of 15 dams and 13,800 km of transmission lines. In Our Backyard tells the story of the Keeyask dam and accompanying development on the Nelson River from the perspective of Indigenous peoples, academics, scientists, and regulators. It builds on the rich environmental and economic evaluations documented in the Clean Environment Commission's public hearings on Keeyask in 2012. It amplifies Indigenous voices that environmental assessment and regulatory processes have often failed to incorporate and provides a basis for ongoing decision-making and scholarship relating to Keeyask and resource development more generally. It considers cumulative, regional, and strategic impact assessments; Indigenous worldviews and laws within the regulatory and decision-making process; the economics of development; models for monitoring and management; consideration of affected species; and cultural and social impacts. With a provincial and federal regulatory regime that is struggling with important questions around the balance between development and sustainability, and in light of the inherent rights of Indigenous people to land, livelihoods, and self-determination, In Our Backyard offers critical reflections that highlight the need for purposeful dialogue, principled decision making, and a better legacy of northern development in the future.

The plans calls for an injection of $50 million from the B.C. government, to be matched by Alcan, which built the Kenney dam on the Nechako in 1952 to power its aluminum smelter in Kitimat. "The project has incredible environmental enhancement, but also can provide some long-term economic stability in the valley, and upstream in the Cheslatta area," Cheslatta senior policy adviser Mike Robertson said Friday.

AB  - Water Security and the Global Water AgendaThis analytical brief proposes a working definition of water security developed from contributions made by the broad range of organizations, agencies, programmes and institutions that form UN-Water. It is intended to serve as a starting point for dialogue on water security in the UN system. The Brief, produced by UN-Water Task Force on Water Security, aims to capture the dynamic and constantly evolving dimensions of water and water-related issues, and offers a holistic outlook for addressing water challenges through the umbrella of water security. UN-Water proposes the following definition of water security: “The capacity of a population to safeguard sustainable access to adequate quantities of and acceptable quality water for sustaining livelihoods, human well-being, and socio-economic development, for ensuring protection against water-borne pollution and water-related disasters, and for preserving ecosystems in a climate of peace and political stability.” This working definition will facilitate critical work. Most immediately, it will be considered by a group of 30 Member States, headed by Hungary and Kenya, tasked with drafting the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals. That report, anticipated around mid-year, is then expected to be taken up at the annual UN General Assembly in September 2013. Note: By nature an Analytical Brief is a discussion piece that can be revised to integrate new evidence or feedback. The brief was slightly modified in October 2013 to incorporate Member States and stakeholders feedback after its initial publication in March 2013.

AB  - Three 30-minute films, made in partnership with two First Nations bands in north central British Columbia --Ts'il Kaz Koh First Nation (Burns Lake Band) and Cheslatta Carrier Nation--describe conflict over land and sovereignty and ask if there is a way forward. This is a story of a people dispossessed, deep historic wounds, and still unresolved conflict between Indigenous people, governments in Canada and industry. It's a story of the struggles of two First Nations in the Carrier territory of north central British Columbia, Canada, for land and sovereignty, for healing and revitalization. The DVD is structured into chapters of three 30-minute documentaries, and it comes with an extensive discussion guide. Chapter 1, The Contagion of Colonialism, looks at the historical circumstances, including the settlement of the west, Canada's Indian Act and the Residential School system. It provides the background on how these First Nations people find themselves in the situations they face today. Chapter 2, High Noon at Burns Lake, tells the story of the Ts'il Kaz Koh First Nation, or Burns Lake Band. Its people have been in conflict with the Village of Burns Lake over appropriated lands for almost a hundred years, a conflict that culminated in the municipality shutting off water and sewerage services to their Reserve in the year 2000. This led to a ruling in favour of the Band by the Supreme Court of British Columbia. Chapter 3, Keeping Our Heads Above Water, tells the story of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation, whose people were evicted from their homeland in 1952 by Alcan's hydroelectric project. Today, they are still struggling to keep their heads above water, culturally and economically. This is 21st century Canada, and the story of two communities--colonizers and the colonized. It's a story with a question mark. After almost a century of apartheid in this region, the film asks: Is there a way forward? Discussion guide available: Finding_Our_Way_discussion_guide_sample.pdf

AB  - This research explores collaborative stewardship on a watershed scale and how local insight canassist in shaping collaborative approaches to culturally appropriate stewardship. The CheslattaCarrier Nation (Cheslatta) have called the upper Nechako watershed home since timeimmemorial. They enjoyed a self-sustaining and peaceful existence until forced to leave whenthe waters started rising as their shores were flooded to create a reservoir. Regardless ofadversity, Cheslatta have worked with passion and tenacity to restore the health of the upperwatershed and the well-being of their people. Guided by Indigenous research approaches andappreciative inquiry, this research reviewed literature, documents and interviews with residentsof the upper Nechako. The gathered data was then analyzed and themes were identified. Thethemes identified offer insights into local perspectives on stewardship, pointing especially to theways reconciliation and community well-being can all be enhanced through cooperative andcollaborative methods

Bark from woody shrubs and trees was used for carbohydrate food, medicine, fiber, and structural material. Use of the bark of twenty one species of woody plants is documented for the Gitksan, Wet'suwet'en and Haisla peoples of Northwest British Columbia. Approximately half of the woody species named by these peoples were used for bark resources. Today, most bark derived products have been replaced with manufactured and agricultural products.

AB  - The mid-Holocene behaviour of five glaciers in the British Columbia Coast Mountains was reconstructed from radiocarbon ages and stratigraphic analysis. Subfossil wood evidence at Canoe, Fyles, Jacobsen, Tchaikazan and Icemaker glaciers suggests these glaciers were expanding into standing forests prior to 6630, 4900 and 4200 cal. yr BP. Stratigraphically constrained woody detritus at Fyles Glacier records the progradational history of a Gilbert-type delta forming in response to glacial expansion between 7020 and 5470 cal. yr BP. This research provides the first evidence for mid-Holocene glacial expansion in the central and northern British Columbia Coast Mountains. Proxy records describing mid-Holocene climates in the British Columbia Coast Mountains indicate a trend towards slightly cooler and possibly wetter conditions than present. Glacial expansion occurring between 7500 and 4000 cal. yr BP has regional correlatives, suggesting coherent broad-scale climate forcing mechanisms influenced glacial mass balance at this time.

AB  - Holocene glacier activity in the northern British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada, is described following investigations in the recently deglaciated forefields of White and South Flat glaciers spilling from the Cambria Icefield. Glacially overridden stumps and detrital wood was radiocarbon and dendrochronologically dated to describe an advance between ad 250 and 650. Expansion and thickening of White Glacier by ad 765 resulted in creation of an ice-dammed lake in South Flat valley that persisted until ad 1080. Following this the lake drained, before refilling in the early 'Little Ice Age' prior to ad 1300. Shortly thereafter White and South Flat glaciers became confluent and flowed over the valley side toward White Lake. The characteristics of the site and the preservation of 1500 yr old deposits indicate that the two glaciers remained confluent throughout the remainder of the 'Little Ice Age', only separating following terminal retreat early in the 20th century. The late-Holocene glacial history of White and South Flat glaciers appears synchronous with those of other glaciers in northern portion of Pacific Northwest.

AB  - Dendroclimatological data were used to reconstruct the discharge history of Chilko River, which drains a glacierized watershed in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. We correlated ring-width records from Engelmann spruce (ES) (Picea engelmanni) and mountain hemlock (MH) (Tsuga mertensiana) trees to historical hydroclimate data. Over the period of record, spruce and hemlock radial growth correlates significantly with temperature and snow depth, respectively. We found that a multi-species approach provided a better model fit and reconstructive power. Using these relationships, we developed generalized linear models for mean June, July, and June-July discharge. The proxy records provide insights into streamflow variability of a typical Coast Mountains river over the past 240 years and confirm the long-term influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on hydroclimatic regimes in the region. A relationship also exists between the reconstructed June-July discharge record and the North Pacific (NP) Index, suggesting that winter atmospheric patterns over the North Pacific influence the hydrology of coastal British Columbia.

AB  - The abundance and distribution of carnivores and their habitat are key information needed for status assessment, conservation planning, population management, and assessment of the effects of human development on their habitat and populations. We developed a habitat quality rating system, using existing wolverine (Gale gulo) distribution, wolverine food, ecosystem mapping, and human development data. We used this and empirically derived estimates of wolverine density to predict wolverine distribution and abundance at a provincial scale. Density estimates for wolverines in high-quality habitat averaged 6.2 wolverines/1,000 km(2) (95% CI = 4.2-9.5). We predicted mean densities ranging from 0.3/1,000 km(2) in rare-qualin, habitat to 4.1/1,000 km(2) in moderate-quality habitat. Our predicted population estimate for wolverines in British Columbia was 3,530 (95% CI - 2,700-4,760). We predicted highest densities of wolverines in interior mountainous regions, moderate densities in interior plateau and boreal forest regions, and low densities in mainland coastal regions and drier interior plateaus. We predicted that wolverines would be rare on Vancouver Island, along the outer mainland coast, and in the dry interior forests, and absent from the Queen Charlotte Islands, interior grassland environments, and areas of intensive urban development.

AB  - Lawsonite blueschist boulders from the Pinchi Fault Zone, British Columbia, locally contain howieite, stilpnomelane, and Na-Ca-amphiboles. These minerals have apparently crystallized late in the metamorphic history of the rocks. The howieite, of which this is the first reported occurrence in Canada, contains more Mg and Al and less Mn than is reported in howieite from other blueschist localities. It is possible that these minerals crystallized at relatively low temperature and pressure, compared to the high-pressure conditions of blueschists.

AB  - The Wicheeda Carbonatite Complex, located 80 km northeast of Prince George in British Columbia, Canada, has been historically explored for its REE potential but, until recently, there has been very little extensive exploration or scientific study. The Complex consists of a carbonatite plug with a series of carbonatite and potassic-syenite dykes and sills emplaced into the upper Cambrian and lower Ordovician Kechika Group. The carbonatite is classified as a calcio- to ferro-carbonatite. Sodic-fenitization is common around the carbonatite and the degree of alteration and frequency of syenite occurrences increase away from the carbonatite plug. The rare earth mineralogy of the Wicheeda carbonatite was defined through the use of petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The REE mineralogy is complex, with multiple stages of primary, late-stage, rapidly cooling crystallization. The mineralogy consists of Ca-REE-fluorocarbonates [including bastnasite-(Ce), parisite-(Ce), and synchysite-(Ce)], Ba-REE-fluorocarbonates [including cordylite-(Ce), kukharenkoite-(Ce), cebaite-(Ce), huangnoite-(Ce), and qaqarssukite-(Ce)], ancylite-(Ce), monazite-(Ce), euxenite-(Y) and allanite-(Ce); the majority of which are LREE-rich. The REE minerals typically form in anhedral aggregates with strontianite, calcite, dolomite, and ankerite. The aggregates range in size from a 1-2 mm but have been observed up to 7 cm. The Ca-REE-fluorocarbonate minerals generally form as syntaxial intergrowths whereas the other REE minerals form individual crystals. The REE content varies throughout the carbonatite intervals with an average of 9663 ppm. Evidence from the Wicheeda Carbonatite Complex and comparisons with other worldwide carbonatites suggest that the complex is derived from low-degree partial melts extracted from metasomatized lithospheric mantle.

AB  - The Quaternary stratigraphy of the Nechako River - Cheslatta Lake area of central British Columbia is described and interpreted to reconstruct the late Quaternary history of the region. Exposures of glacial and nonglacial sediments deposited prior to the last glaciation (Fraser) are limited to three sites. Pollen assemblages from pre-Fraser nonglacial sediments at two of these sites reveal forested conditions around 39 000 BP. During the advance phase of the Fraser Glaciation, glacial lakes were ponded when trunk glaciers blocked some tributary valleys. Early in the glaciation, the drainage was free in easterly draining valleys. Subsequently, the easterly drainage was blocked either locally by sediments and ice or as a result of impoundment of the Fraser River and its tributaries east of the study area. Ice generally moved east and northeast from accumulation zones in the Coast Mountains. Ice flow was influenced by topography. Major late-glacial lakes developed in the Nechako River valley and the Knewstubb Lake region because potential drainage routes were blocked by ice.

AB  - Forages produced in the north central interior of British Columbia are low in percentage crude protein (CP). Growing lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) should increase forage percentage CP, but many of the soils are considered too acidic for this species. The objective of three held experiments, conducted at the Prince George experimental farm, was to evaluate management practices that might accommodate the growth of lucerne on acid soils without the expense of liming. Experiment 1 compared three legume species (lucerne, alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) and red clover (T. pratense L.)), preinoculated lime-coated seed (GNR(TM), Grow Tec Ltd, Nisku, Alberta), and soil liming on root nodulation and forage dry matter (DM) yield. Experiment 2 compared lucerne genetic lines, seed preinoculation and soil liming on root nodulation and forage DM yield and percentage CP. Experiment 3 compared lucerne rhizobia genetic strains, seed preinoculation and soil liming on root nodulation, forage DM yield and percentage CP. For effective nodulation, lucerne required seed preinoculation, whereas alsike clover and red clover did not. Lucerne persisted longer than alsike or red clover. In Expts 2 and 3, the combination of lime and preinoculation increased lucerne DM yield by 136% and %CP from 9.2 to 15.4. The addition of lime alone increased lucerne DM yield by an average of 130% and %CP from 9.2 to 16.3. With preinoculation alone, lucerne DM yield increased by 100% and %CP increased from 9.2 to 12.7. Although using preinoculated lime-coated seed alone is not as effective as lime alone, coated seed may be the preferred method, based on ease of application and cost. Neither the six lucerne lines nor the three rhizobial strains evaluated resulted in improved root nodulation under acidic conditions.

AB  - White Sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus (WS), are distributed throughout three major river basins on the West Coast of North America: the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Columbia, and Fraser River drainages. Considered the largest North American freshwater fish, some WS use estuarine habitat and make limited marine movements between river basins. Some populations are listed by the United States or Canada as threatened or endangered (upper Columbia River above Grand Coulee Dam; Kootenai River; lower, middle and, upper Fraser River and Nechako River), while others do not warrant federal listing at this time (Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers; Columbia River below Grand Coulee Dam; Snake River). Threats that impact WS throughout the species' range include fishing effects and habitat alteration and degradation. Several populations suffer from recruitment limitations or collapse due to high early life mortality associated with these threats. Efforts to preserve WS populations include annual monitoring, harvest restrictions, habitat restoration, and conservation aquaculture. This paper provides a review of current knowledge on WS life history, ecology, physiology, behavior, and genetics and presents the status of WS in each drainage. Ongoing management and conservation efforts and additional research needs are identified to address present and future risks to the species.

AB  - The number of western gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii) infections per tree was measured in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) population consisting of 3,215 trees in 20 blocks, established from a single, large seed lot collected and planted near Prince George, B.C. Canada. Average disease incidence in these blocks varied from 0.58 to 6.07 infections per tree. A method is presented that allows the prediction of tree frequencies by disease severity classes for each block from a single distribution of relative susceptibility. Resistance genes appear to interact multiplicatively. The most susceptible 10% of the population was estimated to have an infection rate about 800X as high as the least susceptible 10%. The implications of this wide range in susceptibility for stability of the patho-system are discussed.

AB  - Management of forested landscapes for biological diversity is a major objective across North America. Perhaps the greatest potential to diversify future forests lies in the vast areas of young second-growth stands which may be managed silviculturally to accelerate ecosystem development. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that large-scale precommercial thinning, at ages 17-27 yr, to various stand densities would, over the 10-yr period since treatment, enhance: (1) productivity of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) crop trees, (2) stand structure attributes, and (3) species richness and diversity of forest floor small-mammal communities. Study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada, in three forest ecological zones. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 (low), similar to 1000 (medium), and similar to 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned juvenile pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Understory vegetation was measured in all stands in 1990, 1993, and 1998, and coniferous tree layers were measured in 1998. Small-mammal populations were sampled intensively in 1990, 1991, and 1998. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Mean height increments of trees were similar in the medium- and high-density stands and significantly higher than that in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George. Crown volume index (biomass) of herbs was highest in the thinned stands by 1998, but there was no difference among stands for shrubs and trees; volume of mosses was highest in the old-growth stands. Mean species richness and diversity of herbs, shrubs, and trees were similar among stands at 2, 5, and 10 yr after thinning. However, mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous trees were significantly higher in the low- and medium-density stands than in the high-density and unthinned stands 10 yr after thinning. Total structural diversity of all vegetation in the low-density stands was significantly greater than that of the medium-density, unthinned, and old-growth stands in 1998. Mean total abundance of all small mammals was similar among stands in 1990-1991, but the low-density and old-growth stands had the most mammals in 1998. Mean abundance of southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) was consistently higher (2.1-3.3 times) in the old-growth stands than in unthinned stands. In seven of nine cases, mean abundance of red-backed voles was similar among old-growth and thinned stands. Mean species richness and species diversity of small mammals were highest in the low-density and medium-density stands. Heavily thinned lodgepole pine stands developed structural attributes such as large diameter trees, large crowns, and structurally diverse vegetative understories. Forest floor small-mammal communities reflected the compositional and structural diversity of these managed stands.

AB  - The aim of this investigation is to obtain some baseline self-reported data on the health status and overall quality of life of all residents of the Bella Coola Valley of British Columbia aged 17 years or older, and to measure the impact of a set of designated health determinants on their health and quality of life. In the period from August to November 2001, a variety of procedures were used to ensure that all eligible residents of the Valley received a copy of our questionnaire, and 687 useable questionnaires were obtained for our working dataset. Health status was measured by SF-36 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control healthy days items. Thirty-one items were used to measure the Provincial Health Officer's designated determinants of health in four clusters, namely, biological, social and economic, health behaviours and health services determinants. Quality of life was measured by satisfaction levels in 13 specific domains of life (e.g., family, financial security), four global items (e.g., happiness, life satisfaction) and one global Subjective Well-Being Index. Besides obtaining baseline figures on all our measures for the Valley, we made some comparisons among our figures and those from other areas, e.g., Prince George, BC. Most of the measures indicated that the health status and quality of life of Bella Coola Valley residents were lower than those of Prince George residents. For the sample as a whole, SF-36 scores on the eight dimensions ran from 82.3 (physical functioning) to 50.0 (social functioning), with a mean of 62.7. Residents in the Valley averaged 6.5 days in the past 30 in which their health was physically not good, 5.5 days when it was mentally not good and 4.1 days when their health limited their usual daily activities. Eleven percent of respondents described their general health as "excellent" and another 27% said it was,'very good". On a 7-point scale from 1 = very dissatisfied to 7 = very satisfied, respondents had average life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores of 5.5. For specific domains of life, the lowest mean level of satisfaction was reported for federal and provincial government officials (3.3) and the highest was reported for living partners and personal safety around home (5.8). Regarding bivariate relations, each of the eight dimensions of SF-36 was significantly correlated with a single item measure of general health, and five of the eight were significantly correlated with the number of good health days. Happiness and the Subjective Well-Being Index were positively but moderately correlated with six of the eight dimensions, and life satisfaction was positively correlated with five. Age was negatively related to general health, but positively related to life satisfaction. Not being of aboriginal descent was positively related to all of the four global health indicators and to the Subjective Well-Being Index. Education was positively related to the four global health measures but not to the three global quality of life measures. The Social Support and Good Family Indexes were positively related to all seven global measures. There was a positive correlation between six of the seven global measures and the frequency with which respondents participated in activities sponsored by voluntary organizations. Frequency of smoking was negatively associated with every global dependent variable except the Physical Health Index. Frequency of skipping meals was negatively associated and average hours of sleep per night was positively associated with all seven global measures. Trning to multivariate relationships, the four clusters of health determinants explained from 12% (SF-36 Mental Health Index) to 24% (general health) of the variance in the dependent global health variables, and from 20% (happiness) to 26% (Subjective Well-Being Index) of the variance in the dependent global quality of life variables. Adding domain satisfaction scores to the total set of predictors allowed us to explain from 20% (SF-36 Mental health Index) to 29% (general health) of the variance in the dependent global health variables, and from 39% (happiness) to 62% (life satisfaction) in the dependent global quality of life variables. By including measures of social support and good family relationships in our set of health determinants, we practically guaranteed that the latter would be relatively strongly predictive of global quality of life.

AB  - This study compares single-site and multisite calibration methods with upscaled parameters for thermal modelling. Multisite calibration and parameter upscaling are novel for calibrating a hydrological-thermal model. To this end, model calibration and simulations are carried out using a semi-distributed hydrological-thermal model (CEQUEAU). First, a hydrological calibration is carried out. The same calibrated hydrological model outputs are used for all thermal calibrations. The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) single-objective optimization algorithm is applied to calibrate the thermal module using observed water temperatures at seven monitoring sites within the Nechako Watershed in British Columbia, Canada. Single-site calibration provided the best performance for individual sites, but these sets of parameters performed poorly when applied to the other sites. The multisite calibration and the upscaled methods perform adequately for all sites with overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)<2 degrees C as an acceptable threshold. However, the multisite method resulted in the best performance metrics and shortest computing time.

AB  - Downward continuation of gravity field can highlight the anomaly of the local and shallow part of the earth, and can separate the anomaly feature from the overlying field. But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to measure the impact of the arts broadly construed on the quality of life. A randomly drawn household sample of 315 adult residents of Prince George, British Columbia served as the working data-set. Examining zero-order correlations, among other things, it was found that playing a musical instrument a number of times per year was positively associated with general health (r = 0.37), while singing alone a number of hours per week was negatively associated with general health (r = -0.19). The strongest positive associations with life satisfaction are satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking and embroidery, needlepoint or cross-stitching, at r = 0.39 and r = 0.32, respectively. The satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking (r = 0.35) and buying works of art (r = 0.32) were the most positive influences on happiness. The strongest associations with the Index of Subjective Well-Being are the satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking (r = 0.37) and the satisfaction obtained from knitting or crocheting (r = 0.34). Examining multivariate relations, it was found that eight predictors combined to explain 59% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, with self-esteem satisfaction (beta = 0.35) and friendship satisfaction (beta = 0.27) most influential. Among the arts-related predictors in the eight, singing alone was fairly influential and negative beta = -0.18), while the satisfaction obtained from reading to others (beta = 0.08) and the Index of Arts as Self-Health Enhancers (beta = 0.11) were somewhat less influential. When the arts-related predictors were combined with a set of domain satisfaction predictors, total explanatory power was increased by only 3 percentage points. Seven predictors could explain 58% of the variance in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores. Of the arts-related predictors, only time spent going to non-art museums was significant (beta = 0.07). Arts-related predictors did not increase explanatory power at all beyond that obtained from domain satisfaction variables alone. Eight predictors explained 42% of the variance in happiness scores, with the most influential predictors including satisfaction with self-esteem (beta = 0.37) and financial security (beta = 0.21), followed by the Index Arts as Self-Developing Activities (beta = 0.18). Arts-related predictors added 3 percentage points of explanatory power to that obtained from domain satisfaction scores. Seven predictors could explain 65% of the variance in scores on the Index of Subjective Well-Being, led by self-esteem satisfaction (beta = 0.35) and financial security satisfaction (beta = 0.30). The Index of Arts as Community Builders had a modest influence (beta = 0.11), but all together, arts-related predictors increased our total explanatory power by a single percentage point. Summarizing these multivariate results, it seems fair to say that, relative to the satisfaction obtained from other domains of life, the arts had a very small impact on the quality of life (measured in four somewhat different ways) of a sample of residents of Prince George who generally cared about the arts. Even in absolute terms, arts-related activities could only explain from 5% to 11% of the variance in four plausible measures of the self-perceived quality of respondents' lives. By comparing the composition of our sample with census data from 2001, it was demonstrated that the sample was not representative of residents of our city. It would, therefore, be wrong to generalize our findings to the whole populatin of Prince George or to any larger population.

AB  - There is a concern that the accelerated timber harvest in the mountain pine beetle epidemic area of British Columbia (BC) could compromise long-term forest productivity if soils are unduly disturbed. Consequently, the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources Operations (MFLNRO) developed a protocol using ground- and image-based methods to assess the status of the forest soil resource in part of the BC Forest and Range Evaluation Program (FREP). Although this protocol uses high-resolution aerial imagery, the MFLNRO is also collecting beetle imagery at a smaller scale for detecting and monitoring. For this evaluation, we use a combination of ground- and imagery-based assessments as developed for FREP within the BC Interior Plateau. We determined that low-resolution data are useful and are sufficient for detecting and measuring the extent of roads and landings. Areas occupied by landslides, erosion, drainage diversion, inordinate disturbance, or roadside work areas can be captured on remote-sensed images with spatial resolution greater than 2.5 m. However, based on this review and previous work, aerial photographs in 10-cm pixel size are best suited to reveal less evident harvesting-related soil disturbance. (c) The Authors.

AB  - Despite their unmistakable significance in regional histories and unique roles in cultural transmission and traditions, Indigenous trail systems are frequently ignored in non-Indigenous heritage resource management regimes. These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship.

AB  - Precious metal mineralization in the Nechako region of central British Columbia, western Canada is represented by two types of epithermal mineralization hosted in Late Cretaceous to Middle Eocene felsic to intermediate flows, tuffs and breccias. The Capoose, Blackwater and Newton deposits contain disseminated sulphide Au-Ag mineralization associated with low temperature, silica-sericite alteration of Late Cretaceous fragmental volcanic rocks. Structural controls are not obvious, but the location of the Newton prospect between two regional dextral faults support regional-scale structural influences on the localization of mineralization. At Blackdome, Clisbako and Wolf, more traditional low-sulfidation Au-Ag epithermal mineralization is hosted in Eocene fragmental felsic volcanic rocks affected by multi-stage veining and brecciation, and appear to be strongly structurally controlled. These two styles of mineralization probably reflect an evolution of metallogenic conditions associated with episodic but widespread continental magmatism in a post-accretionary extensional tectonic setting.

The main aim of the survey was to measure respondents' assessments of local police services in Prince George, and their relative impact on the quality of respondents' lives. Generally speaking, the evaluations were quite favourable. For example, in response to the question 'what kind of a job do you think the RCMP are doing', 30% said a 'very good job' and 38% said a 'fairly good job', compared to 2% who said they were doing a 'very poor job' and 4% more a 'fairly poor job'. Compared to a 1997 survey, fewer people thought that crime had increased in the past few years, which is actually consistent with official crime statistics. The biggest perceived problem was with speeding and careless driving, although respondents rated traffic and highway enforcement as the least important of a dozen kinds of police activities. People most appreciated police work aimed at preventing crimes. Of the things people did to protect themselves from becoming a victim, keeping items in their cars out of sight headed the list. As in previous surveys in this community, highest levels of satisfaction were expressed for living partners and family relations generally. Estimating the relative impact of three police/crime related variables ( satisfaction with feelings of personal safety around one's home and in one's community, and with local policing services) on the quality of life measured in five different ways in the context of 12 other variables, it was found that only the last variable ( satisfaction with policing services) had a statistically significant association to the quality of life measured in three of the five ways. Forty percent of the variation in happiness scores and 63% of the variation in life satisfaction scores could be explained by five and six predictors, respectively, without any significant association with satisfaction with policing services. Sixty-two percent of the variation in satisfaction with respondents' overall quality of life scores could be explained by eight predictors, with satisfaction with policing services as the third most influential predictor behind satisfaction with respondents' self-esteem and friendships. Sixty-one percent of the variation in satisfaction with respondents' standard of living scores was explained by seven predictors, with satisfaction with policing services being least influential. Finally, 76% of the variation in an index of subjective well-being ( summing the scores of the other four global indicators) was explained by nine predictors, with satisfaction with policing services being second least influential.

AB  - There is now growing evidence that large-magnitude earthquakes have occurred and could occur again along the Cascadia subduction zone located west of Vancouver Island, Bristish Columbia. Numerical simulations indicate that these earthquakes would produce long-duration ground motions and would thus be capable of inducing a large number of reversals of inelastic deformations in engineered structures. Efforts have now been undertaken to account for this damage potential in building codes. In this paper, inelastic design spectra are developed for Cascadia subduction earthquakes for four sites in British Columbia. These spectra are compared with elastic design spectra that have been developed recently for the same sites based on empirical attenuation relationships for Cascadia events. The approach used to develop the inelastic spectra aims at providing the same level of protection against structural failure for both subduction events and crustal or subcrustal earthquakes. Force modification factors are first determined for structures exhibiting various failure modes and ductility levels when subjected to representative crustal and subcrustal earthquake ground motions. Thereafter, design spectra are developed for the same structures to prevent structural collapse under simulated Cascadia subduction ground motions. The study reveals that the elastic spectra do not reflect adequately the damage potential of Cascadia earthquakes. These elastic spectra generally are unconservative for Tofino and Victoria. For Vancouver and Prince George, the elastic spectra overestimate the demand, especially for short-period structures.

AB  - An advanced process control strategy was implemented on the chemical recovery boiler Canadian Forest Products Ltd. Intercontinental Pulp in Prince George, BC. The boiler performance was reviewed before and after control strategy implementation. A boiler fouling index used by the mill reliably indicates the degree of plugging of convection surfaces. Results show that implementation of advanced control and automatic operation significantly stabilizes recovery furnace operation and reduces the accumulation rate of ash deposits and fouling of the convection surfaces. The time between water Washes of the boiler is significantly extended, coinciding with increased liquor firing and pulp production.

AB  - A new paradigm in forest management is managing second-growth forests to accelerate development of structural characteristics associated with late-seral forests. A key uncertainty is whether those wildlife species associated with these structural characteristics will respond positively to their development in thinned young seral forests. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that population dynamics (abundance, breeding condition, and survival) of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) would be maintained at levels recorded in old-growth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young (17-27 years old) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests. Replicated study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three young pine stands thinned to densities of similar to500 (low), similar to1000 (medium), and similar to2000 (high) stems/ha, with unthinned (4300-7600 stems/ha) and old-growth stands for comparison. Populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus were sampled intensively from 2000 to 2002 corresponding to 12-14 years after thinning. Abundance of G. sabrinus was significantly higher in the high-density stand and lowest in the low-density and unthinned stands. Intermediate densities were found in the medium-density and old-growth stands. Adult male body mass was significantly greater in old-growth than high-density stands. We failed to detect significant differences among treatments for recruitment, movement, and survival for G. sabrinus and all parameters measured for T. hudsonicus. Survival increased significantly in 2002 from previous years for G. sabrinus, while survival decreased significantly for T. hudsonicus during this period. Our results support the hypothesis that population dynamics of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus would be maintained at levels recorded in oldgrowth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young lodgepole pine forests. Abundance of G. sabrinus in highdensity stands exceeded levels recorded in old-growth stands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A variety of silvicultural practices may be used to diversify second- growth forests that have regenerated from clearcut harvesting. These young stands are structurally simple and amenable to practices such as variable-density and conventional thinnings to accelerate ecosystem development. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that (i) abundance and diversity of forest floor small mammals, and (ii) population dynamics (reproduction, recruitment, and survival) of the southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) would be maintained at levels recorded in old-g-rowth forest, by large-scale thinning to various densities in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. Replicate study areas were located near Pendcion, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to500 (low), similar to1000 (medium), and similar to2000 (high) stems/ha. with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Forest floor small mammal communities were sampled intensively in 2000, 2001, and 2002 at 12-14-years after the pre-commercial thinning treatment. Mean total abundance of small mammals was similar among stands with the highest overall numbers recorded in 2002. Mean species richness and diversity of small mammals were similar among stands. Mean abundance of C. gapperi was similar among stands and increased significantly with time. This pattern of abundance of C. gapperi will Rely be consistent except perhaps in years of high numbers when productivity of this species may be highest in old-growth forest. Reproduction, recruitment, and early juvenile survival of C. gapperi was similar among stands; Jolly-Seber skimmer survival was higher in the thinned than unthinned stands with no difference in winter survival among stands. Our results supported hypotheses (i) and (ii) that abundance and diversity of forest floor small mammals and the demographic attributes of C. gapperi populations would be maintained in young managed lodgepole pine stands (thinned or unthinned) at levels recorded in old-growth forest.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to measure levels of ethnic or cultural background diversity, social cohesion and modern prejudice, and the impact of such diversity, cohesion and prejudice on the quality of life. Using a sample of 743 residents of Prince George, British Columbia, we identified diverse ethnic or cultural groups, and created several indexes of heterogeneous social networks and a measure of modern prejudice. Dividing the total sample into three roughly distinct groups containing, respectively, respondents self-reporting an ethnic or cultural background that was aboriginal, non-aboriginal visible minority or anything else, we discovered that all significant comparisons indicated that people with aboriginal backgrounds reported a generally lower quality of life than those in the other two groups. The quality of life scores of the other two groups were practically indistinguishable. Given the demographic structure of our sample, the revealed differences could not be attributed to differences in socio-economic classes. Members of the largest group of respondents tended to be most prejudiced and optimistic, people with aboriginal backgrounds tended to be least prejudiced and optimistic and people with visible minority backgrounds tended to be between the other two groups. Regressions revealed that a variety of ethnic/culture-related phenomena could only explain 8%, 9% and 10%, respectively, of the variation in scores for happiness, life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life. When domain satisfaction scores were added to the set of predictors, we were able to explain 48%, 69% and 54%, respectively, of the variation in scores for happiness, life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life. In the presence of the domain satisfaction scores, the scores on the ethnic/cultural related phenomena added only one percentage point of explanatory power for happiness and life satisfaction, and three percentage points for satisfaction with the overall quality of life. All things considered, then, it is fair to say that this project showed that ethnic or cultural background diversity, social cohesion and modern prejudice had relatively very little impact on the quality of life of our sample of respondents.

AB  - Biological, physical and chemical characteristics of the water column of a shallow (z(max) = 9.2 m), small (surface area 3.8 km(2)) residential and recreational lake near Prince George, British Columbia, indicated that the system was being loaded internally with phosphorus (P) from the sediments. The abundance of P released from the fine glaciolacustrine, and organic rich sediments was resulting in excess algal and weed growth. It was postulated that iron-phosphate reduction at redox potentials below approximately 200 mV and/or bacterially mediated orthophosphate (PO4-P) releases could be occurring. The development of an appropriate nutrient management strategy required that the process associated with the sediment P release be determined. The MINTEQA2 geochemical model was used to predict the release of orthophosphate (PO4-P) into the interstitial water with the assumption that P is present alternately as strengite, variscite and hydroxyapatite. The predicted release of PO4-P from these P containing minerals was compared to the concentration of PO4-P and total phosphorus (TP) in the overlying hypolimnion. In order to improve the accuracy of the model prediction, the proportion of the sediment present as iron-bound phosphate was estimated. A significant correlation between the observed hypolimnetic TP and interstitial PO4-P concentrations as predicted from iron-bound P dissolution (r(2) = 0.59) was found. Total phosphorus release rates to the hypolimnion were also found to be strongly correlated to the iron-bound P component of the sediment (r(2) = 0.88). Multivariate regression analyses showed significant relationships between hypolimnetic PO4-P and sediment iron-bound P, Eh, and interstitial Fe (r(2) = 0.76). These results provided sufficient evidence to conclude that PO4-P in the system is predominantly bound to Fe-containing minerals and therefore could be managed using treatment techniques that address iron-bound phosphates.

AB  - Apatite is a common resistate mineral occurring in a range of host rocks and ore-related hydrothermal alteration assemblages. Apatite in several porphyry copper deposits in British Columbia has a unique set of physical and compositional characteristics that can be used to evaluate the chemical conditions of magmas that formed the causative intrusions or associated hydrothermal alteration. Apatite under visible light and SEM shows no notable variations between unaltered and altered varieties but cathodoluminescence reveals significant differences. Apatite in unaltered rocks displays yellow, yellow-brown, and brown luminescence, whereas in K silicate-altered rocks apatite displays a characteristic green luminescence. The green-luminescent apatite replaces yellow-or brown-luminescent apatite and locally overgrows it. Apatite occurring with muscovite (i.e., phyllic)-altered rocks displays characteristic gray luminescence. The chemistry of apatite, as determined by electron microprobe and laser ICP-MS analyses, directly reflects its alteration and luminescence. The unaltered yellow-luminescent apatite has high concentrations of Mn (0.3-0.5 wt % MnO) and a high Mn/Fe ratio (>1), whereas the brown-luminescent apatite has low Mn, but higher concentrations of S and REE + Y. The green K silicate alteration-related luminescence is caused by lower Mn/Fe ratios (ca. 1) along with depletions of other trace elements such as Cl, S, and Na. Gray-luminescent apatite occurring with muscovite-altered rocks results from significant Mn loss (<0.15% MnO) contemporaneous with depletion in Na, S, Cl, and REE during low pH phyllic alteration in calc-alkalic porphyry deposits. The correlation between apatite texture, luminescence, and chemical composition with the type and intensity of porphyry alteration offers a potentially fast and effective method to utilize it as an indicator for porphyry mineralization in a range of exploration materials including soils, regoliths, and heavy mineral concentrates from glacial and fluvial materials.

AB  - A localized version of the Forest Vegetation Simulator (FVS) individual tree growth model was developed to simulate stand level impacts under a variety of uneven-aged management regimes in old-growth interior spruce-subalpine fir forests near Prince George British Columbia. Options for using uneven-aged management to satisfy a range of management objectives were simulated using different sets of BDq regulation parameters, and by varying species composition and rules for reserve trees. The greatest timber yields were attained by promoting the highest possible spruce component, using high q ratios, low to moderate maximum diameters and 20 to 25 year cutting cycles, and allowing no reserves. Using strategies to promote stand structures maintaining some old-growth attributes resulted in much lower timber yields.

AB  - The relationship between ambient fine particle (PM2.5) concentration and children's personal exposure was investigated in Prince George, British Columbia. Repeated personal exposure measures (10 per subject) of 15 children and ambient concentrations at their neighbourhood schools were collected for a 6-week winter period in 2001. PM2.5 mass, sulphate (SO42-) and light absorbing carbon (ABS) were determined for all samples and the relationship between ambient concentration and personal exposure was investigated. Overall, lower particle exposures and a lower personal-ambient regression slope were found for Prince George children compared to results from other longitudinal studies of children. This suggests that in this setting indoor environments may have less influence from ambient sources and greater influence from non-ambient sources. Comparison of personal exposures and ambient concentrations for each individual indicated higher Spearman correlations for SO42- (median = 0.95) and ABS (median = 0.73) compared to total PM2.5 mass (median = 0.55). A large degree of individual variability in the personal-ambient correlation was found for PM2.5 mass, while SO42- showed very consistent results, supporting its use as an indicator of exposure to particulate matter of ambient origin. ABS was slightly more variable than SO42- due to the influence of non-ambient or very local sources in a low number of samples. The impact of local meteorology was also investigated and inversion conditions were connected to all high ambient levels (> 30 mu g m(-3)). In addition, associations were found between inversion strength and personal exposure. This finding suggests that reduction of ambient concentrations during stagnant periods would result in lower personal exposure levels. This study highlights the importance of both ambient and non-ambient sources, supports the use of both SO42- and ABS as tracers of background ambient particle exposure and demonstrates the significant effect of winter meteorology on both outdoor levels and personal exposure in a valley community.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to explain the impact of people's self-reported health on their levels of satisfaction with their health, and the impact of these things plus satisfaction with other specific domains of their lives on the perceived quality of their lives. The latter was operationalized as general happiness, satisfaction with life as a whole and overall satisfaction with the quality of life. Seven hundred and twenty-three (723) usable questionnaires returned from a mailout random sample of 2500 households of Prince George, British Columbia in November 1998 formed the working data-set for our analyses. Among other things, mean respondent scores on the SF-36 health profile were found to be lower than published norms from the UK, USA, Netherlands and Sweden, but higher than scores from Aberdeen, Scotland. Mean scores on the CES-D depression scale also indicated that our respondents tended to have more depressive symptoms than comparison groups in Winnipeg and the USA. A review of trends in mean scores on 17 quality of life items (e.g., satisfaction with family life, financial security, recreation, etc.) from 1994, 1997 and 1998 revealed that there were only 7 statistically significant changes across the four year period and they were all negative. Multivariate regression analysis showed that health status measured with a variety of indicators could explain 56% of the variation in respondents' reported satisfaction with their health. A combination of health status plus domain satisfaction indicators could explain 53% of the variation in respondents' reported happiness, 68% of reported life satisfaction and 63% of reported satisfaction with the overall quality of life. Sixty percent of the explained variation in happiness scores was attributable to self-reported health scores, while only 18% of the explained variation in satisfaction with life and with the overall quality of life scores was attributable self-reported health scores.

AB  - The number and size of checks, wood moisture content, extent of blue-stain, rot and decay was examined by stem analysis in 360 mature standing beetle-killed lodgepole pines. Trees came from three areas (Burns Lake, Quesnel, and Vander-hoof) in Central British Columbia. Each area was represented by 14 to 16 sampling areas (stands) distributed evenly across three soil moisture regimes (dry, mesic, wet). Year of death was estimated from tree ring-analysis, local knowledge and insect and disease survey maps. An approximately equal number of trees had been dead for one or two years, three or four years, or for five or more years. During the first five years since death by beetle attack the number of checks per tree increased from 2.5 to 10.2 and the average depth of checks increased from 4.3 cm to 5.1 cm. Checks were deeper, wider, and longer on the drier sites than on mesic and wet sites. Moisture content of sapwood and heartwood was near the fibre saturation point (ca 30%) one year after death and continued to decrease at a rate of approximately 1.7% per year. Both the incidence and the extent (relative to basal area) of rot and decay increased significantly with time since death. All trees had an extensive blue-stain discoloration. Deterioration of wood quality was fastest during the first two years after a beetle attack.

AB  - We used an on-site mobile laboratory to assess the effects of pulp mill effluent on juvenile (similar to0.9 g) chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792), that normally overwinter under ice in the upper Fraser River at Prince George, British Columbia. After a 28-day exposure at 0.4-2.7 degreesC to secondary-treated bleached kraft mill effluent (TBKME; 0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, or 16%) under both normoxic and hypoxic (similar to67% air saturation) conditions, hematocrit (Hct), leucocrit (Lct), and differential white blood cell counts were determined and gills were examined for gross and fine morphometry. TBKME had no effect on either Hct or Lct, but the highest TBKME concentration (16%) increased lymphocyte numbers, reduced secondary lamellae numbers, and increased the blood-water diffusion distance of secondary lamellae. Given the relatively high TBKME concentration, compared with actual discharges to the river, and the small physiological changes observed, it appears that chronic winter exposure of juvenile chinook salmon to TBKME under hypoxic winter conditions is unlikely to produce major disturbances to these aspects of the fish's physiology.

AB  - This article is based on the idea that crime should be analyzed in terms of both volume and seriousness. Crime rates are the most usual measure of the volume of criminality at a given time or a given place. Statistics Canada recently developed a Crime Severity Index to account for variations in the seriousness of police-recorded criminal infractions. A close look at its construction reveals that the Index is a weighted rate influenced by both the volume and the seriousness of recorded infractions. This article introduces a new indicator designed to measure the seriousness of recorded infractions. The measure is based on simple calculations and easy to interpret. It suggests that serious crime has decreased since the 1980s. It also suggests that city and province rankings based solely on crime rates are misleading because high levels of crime do not necessarily indicate high levels of the more serious crimes.

AB  - Celebrating the United Nations' International Year of Older Persons, in September 1999 a survey research project was undertaken throughout the Northern Interior Health Region (NIHR) of British Columbia. A total of 875 people completed 23-page questionnaires, the average age of the respondents was 69 and the range ran from 55 to 95 years. Responses to the SF-36 questionnaire indicated that for male respondents aged 55-64, the mean score for the 8 dimensions was 74.4. This mean was practically identical to that of the United States norm for such people (74.5) and lower than that for the United Kingdom (77.4). For male respondents aged 65 and older, the mean was 68.3. This was numerically higher but again practically the same as that of the norm for the United States (68.1). For females aged 55-64, the mean score for 8 dimensions was 73. This was superior to that of the United States norm of (70.6) for such people and lower than that for the United Kingdom (74.6). For female respondents aged 65 and older, the mean score was 65.4. This was practically identical to that of the United States (65.5). Comparing 18 average figures for our respondents on satisfaction with specific domains of life (e.g., financial security, health, friendships) and life as a whole with those of average adults in Prince George in November 1999, we found that in all but two cases the older people's scores were higher. Only in the cases of satisfaction with health and overall happiness were older people's scores lower, and the differences were not statistically significant. Eleven percent of our respondents reported that they had been a victim of a crime in the last year, compared to 38% in our 1997 adult victimization survey. Older people had a more benign view than ordinary adults of the growth of crime in their neighbourhood and city, although exactly 64% of both groups thought that crime had increased in Canada. Although older people had a more optimistic view than other adults of the increase in crime in their neighbourhoods, fewer of the former than the latter felt safe out at night. Nevertheless, compared to adults surveyed in 1997, the behaviour of respondents in our survey of older people was not as constrained by concerns of criminal victimization. Two or three of the 8 SF-36 health dimensions explained 37% of the variation in life satisfaction scores, 34% of variation in happiness scores, 34% in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores and 22% in satisfaction with one's overall standard of living. In every case, Mental Health was the dimension that had the greatest impact on our four dependent variables. When all of our potential predictors were entered into a regression equation simultaneously, we found that they could explain 60% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, 44% in happiness scores, 58% in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores and 59% in satisfaction with one's overall standard of living scores.

AB  - The Fraser River system consists of five white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) management units, two of which are listed as endangered populations under Canada's Species at Risk Act. The delineation of these management units was based primarily on population genetic analysis with samples parsed by collection location. We used polysomic microsatellite markers to examine population structure in the Fraser River system with samples parsed by collection location and with a genetic clustering algorithm. Strong levels of genetic divergence were revealed above and below Hells Gate, a narrowing of the Fraser canyon further obstructed by a rockslide in 1913. Additional analyses revealed population substructure on the Fraser River above Hells Gate. The Middle Fraser River (SG-3) and Nechako River were found to be distinct populations, while the Upper Fraser River, although currently listed as an endangered population, represented a mixing area for white sturgeon originating from SG-3 and Nechako. Differences between these results and previous genetic investigations may be attributed to the detection of population mixing when genetic clustering is used to infer population structure.

AB  - Adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, N = 179) from six Fraser River populations (British Columbia) were intercepted in continental shelf waters similar to 215 km from the Fraser River mouth, gastrically implanted with acoustic transmitters, non-lethally biopsied for blood biochemistry, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and somatic energy density and then released. Migration behaviour and travel times to the river mouth and into the river were monitored by underwater telemetry receivers positioned at the river mouth and in the river. Post-release survival of salmon was excellent, with 84% (N = 150) of fish reaching the furthest receiving station similar to 85 km upriver. Fish from Late-summer run populations (Adams and Weaver Creek) averaged a migration rate of similar to 20 km day(-1) through the marine area and held at the river mouth and adjacent areas for 7-9 days before entering the river. Summer-run populations (Birkenhead, Chilko, Horsefly and Stellako) had a migration rate similar to 33 km day(-1) and held for only 1-3 days. Once in river, similar patterns were observed: Late-run populations migrated at similar to 28 km day(-1) and Summer-run populations at similar to 40 km day(-1). From point of release to the river mouth, males migrated faster than females, but once in river migration rates did not differ between sexes. Among all females, a correlation was discovered between levels of circulating testosterone and river entry timing. This correlation was not observed among males. Plasma K+, Cl-, glucose, lactate and osmolality were also correlated with entry timing in both sexes.

AB  - Vegetation management in northern coniferous forest ecosystems may have implications for small mammal communities. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide-induced habitat alteration would reduce small mammal populations in early-successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest. A secondary objective was to determine the long-term influence of herbicide treatment on reproduction, survival, and growth attributes of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) populations. Small mammal populations were intensively sampled in 4 pairs of control and treatment sites dominated by early-successional vegetation (5-10 yr after clearcut harvesting) near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Sampling was conducted during 1987 (pretreatment year), 1988-89 (first and second posttreatment years), and in 1991-92 (fourth and fifth posttreatment years). Higher mean numbers of red-backed voles (P = 0.03) and shrews (Sorex spp.; P = 0.001) were present on control than treatment sites during 1988-92. Mean abundance of meadow voles (Microncs pennsylvanicus; P = 0.69) and deer mice (P = 0.20) were similar on control and treatment sites throughout the study Short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) and long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata) were commonly captured on both control and treatment sites. There were no consistent differences between control and treatment populations in body mass, total biomass, or proportion of adult male and female red-backed voles and deer mice in breeding condition. However, there was a higher mean number of successful pregnancies in control than treatment populations of red-backed voles (P = 0.02) but not deer mice (P = 0.18) during posttreatment years. Mean Jolly-Seber estimates of survival of red-backed voles (P = 0.01) but not deer mice (P = 0.70) were higher in treatment than control populations. The magnitude of observed demographic effects from herbicide treatment were well within the mean values of natural fluctuations of these variables. Herbicide treatment of areas dominated by early-successional vegetation in northern coniferous forests should be staggered in time and space to allow recovery (2-3 yr) of vegetation and small mammal species such as red-backed voles and shrews.

AB  - HF measurements in Prince George, British Columbia ( Canada), at five radar frequencies between 9.3 and 15.7 MHz are considered to study the Doppler velocity of E region coherent echoes. One event showing a regular variation of velocity with radar frequency, slant range, and azimuth of observations is analyzed in detail. For this event, plasma drifts were in access of 700m s(-1), but the observed velocities were below 250 m s(-1) since measurements were performed at large flow angles ( L shell angles 45degrees<phi<100degrees). We show that measured Doppler velocity depends on irregularity scale but only within the Farley-Buneman (F-B) instability cone (45degrees<phi<75degrees). We demonstrate that maximum velocities measured at the highest radar frequency are similar to1.3 times larger than those at the lowest frequency. We also show that for observations inside the instability cone, the velocity magnitude strongly decreases with aspect angle and the rate of the decrease is scale sensitive. The effect can be described by the fluid theory formula if the nominal electron collision frequencies are replaced by anomalous collision frequencies that are similar to5 times larger. However, for observations outside the F-B instability cone (75degrees<phi<100degrees), the Doppler velocity does not show significant variation with aspect angle. For these directions, velocity change with flow angle was insignificant, very similar at all radar frequencies, and not consistent with the expected "cosine'' law. The implications of the measurements on the theory of electrojet instabilities and the processes of coherent echo formation are discussed.

AB  - In this study we investigated quantitative genetic variation in tracheid characteristics in two genetic tests of British Columbia's interior spruce (the common name for white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Engelmann spruce, Picea engelmanni Parry ex Engelm.; and their hybrids). The Study included 88 half-sib families from the East Kootenay and Prince George regions. We have developed a technique for quantitative assessment of tracheid characteristics by measuring cross-sectional dimensions. We obtained cell size, wall thickness and their ratio in early-, transition-, and late-wood classes within a growth ring. Tracheid length and microfibril angle were measured in the transition wood. A number of tracheid characteristics showed significant genetic variation, but heritability, phenotypic, and genetic correlation estimates varied across test sites within and outside regions of origin of parental trees. Ring width was determined, both phenotypically and genetically, by the number of tracheids and to a lesser extent by the by their mean size. On average, rings with larger tracheids did not have significantly thicker walls. Wider rings had lower mean wall to tracheid size ratio. Faster growth did not result in shorter tracheids in the transition wood. Longer tracheids had lower microfibril angle. There were no particular benefits from considering the anatomical Component traits for breaking the negative genetic correlation between growth and wood density.

AB  - The aim of this investigation was to explain the impact of crime-related issues on satisfaction with the quality of life, satisfaction with life as a whole and happiness in the city of Prince George, British Columbia. As explanatory variables, we had measures of respondent fears of and actual cases of victimization, Indexes of Neighbourhood Problems, Police Performance, Neighbourhood Worries, Defensive Behaviour, beliefs about increases in local crime, satisfaction with personal and family safety, and satisfaction with a variety of domains of life (e.g., friendships, financial security, health). Collectively such variables could explain only 5% of the variation in happiness scores, 7% of the variation in life satisfaction scores and 9% of the variation in satisfaction with the quality of life scores. However, they could explain 38% of the variation in overall neighbourhood satisfaction scores. When measures of satisfaction with family life, health, self-esteem, etc. were added, we found that crime related issues were simply displaced by the other measures and that we could explain 31% of the variation in overall happiness scores, 58% of the variation in life satisfaction scores and 59% of the variation in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores. We conclude, therefore, that crime-related issues have relatively little impact on people's satisfaction with the quality of their lives, with life satisfaction or happiness here.

AB  - Examining an aggregated sample (N = 8800) of residents who responded to one of 16 surveys undertaken in Prince George, British Columbia in the period from November 1997 to February 2005, it was found that satisfaction with the quality of life of unemployed residents is lower than that of residents with Aboriginal backgrounds and that satisfaction with the quality of life of the latter is still lower than that of young people. Nevertheless, satisfaction with the quality of life of young people was significantly lower than that of the total sampled population, as well as that of the selected mid-life and retirement groups. Regarding predictors of our three global dependent variables (satisfaction with life as a whole and with the overall quality of life, and happiness) for the three groups (unemployed, Aboriginals and youth) and the total population, we found that the Aboriginal group was most different from all others. Satisfaction with one's own self-esteem was the most influential predictor of each global indicator for every group except Aboriginal residents. For the latter, self-esteem satisfaction was only the strongest predictor of satisfaction with the overall quality of life. The strongest predictor of life satisfaction for the Aboriginal group was satisfaction with friendships, and there were two domain satisfaction scores tied (friendships and living partner) for most influential predictors of happiness. Self-esteem satisfaction ranked second in strength of influence on Aboriginal happiness and life satisfaction.

AB  - Red-attack damage caused by mountain pine beetle (Dentroctonus ponderosa Hopkins) infestation in stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the Prince George Forest Region of British Columbia was examined using multitemporal Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery acquired in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The image data were geometrically and atmospherically corrected, and processed using the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) to obtain wetness indices. The final steps included pixel subtraction, enhancement, and thresholding of the wetness index differences. The resulting enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) was used to interpret spectral patterns in stands with confirmed (through aerial survey) red-attack damage in 2001, and these EWDI patterns were compared to the patterns of reflectance in normal-colour composites. We stratified the aerial survey dataset into two levels and used the EWDI to discriminate classes of 10-29 red-attack trees and 30-50 red-attack trees, and a sample of healthy forest collected from inventory data. Classification accuracy of red-attack damage based on the EWDI ranged from 67% to 78% correct. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale habitat alteration by stand thinning over a range of densities would increase the abundance and related population dynamics of northwestern chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of approximate to 500 (low), 1000 (medium), and 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned young pine stand and an old-growth pine stand for comparison. Chipmunk populations were sampled intensively in thinned stands from 1989 to 1991 and in the unthinned and old-growth stands from 1990 to 1991. Habitat structure was sampled in all stands in 1990. For herbs and shrubs, the crown volume index values were similar among stands; for trees, this index was lowest for the low-density stands, with the index for all three thinned stands being lower than that for the unthinned stands. Species diversity and the structural diversity of vegetation were similar among stands. The abundance of chipmunks was significantly higher in low-density than in high-density thinned stands at Penticton (1.3-1.9 times higher) and Prince George (2.4-3.8 times higher) but not at Kamloops. Chipmunks were less abundant in old-growth stands than in the other four treatment stands. Breeding performance and recruitment followed the same pattern as abundance. Chipmunk survival was generally similar among stands. There were heavier chipmunks in the low-density stands in some years at Penticton. Northwestern chipmunks appear to prefer "open" habitats generated by heavy thinning of young lodgepole pine stands. This result was achieved in three different forest ecological zones and may enhance the overall forest ecosystem.

AB  - This paper presents results from a simulation study motivated by a recent study of the relationships between ambient levels of air pollution and human health in the community of Prince George, British Columbia. The simulation study was designed to evaluate the performance of methods based on overdispersed Poisson regression models for the analysis of series of count data. Aspects addressed include estimation of the dispersion parameter, estimation of regression coefficients and their standard errors, and the performance of model selection tests. The effects of varying amounts of overdispersion and differing underlying variance structure on this performance were of particular interest. This study is related to work reported by Breslow (1990) although the context is quite different. Preliminary work led to the conclusion that estimation of the dispersion parameter should be based on Pearson's chi-square statistic rather than the Poisson deviance. Regression coefficients are well estimated, even in the presence of substantial overdispersion and when the model for the variance function is incorrectly specified. Despite potential greater variability, the empirical estimator of the covariance matrix is preferred because the model-based estimator is unreliable in general. When the model for the variance function is incorrect, model-based test statistics may perform poorly, in sharp contrast to empirical test statistics, which performed very well in this study.

AB  - In this paper, we employ artificial neural network (ANN) together with image analysis techniques to automate the assessment of erythrocyte disorders using blood parameters such as red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb) level, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The neural network is trained using 800 blood sample images collected from the Prince George-BC, Hospital. The images are captured using a high-resolution digital camera mounted on a microscope. The red, green, and blue values of each image are fed as the input of the neural network. The Hospital RBC, Hgb values of the samples measured using hydrodynamic focused analyzer (CELL-DYN 3200 System) are provided as the target values during training. Several variations of the back propagation-learning algorithm were applied for training. The trained network is tested against 200 blood samples. The output results are compared with those of Hospital laboratory and found to be near identical, most of which are within 5% margin of error, and are much significantly better than those published. The proposed method is Simple, fast, accurate, and can be a crucial step in automating laboratory reporting.

AB  - Juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were captured at six sites on the upper Fraser, Nechako, and Thompson rivers, British Columbia, Canada. Biological responses were measured in the liver to assess the effects of contaminants on the fish before they began migration downstream. Both ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP 1A concentrations were significantly enhanced, being two- to three-fold higher in Fraser River samples compared with those fish from reference sites on the Nechako River. DNA adduct concentrations were two- to four-fold higher in Fraser River fish, although liver histopathology appeared unaffected. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the carcasses contributed to total contaminant burdens of less than 1 pg,g(-1). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were undetectable in nearly all samples of bile. There were strong correlations between EROD activity, CYP 1A induction, and DNA adduct concentrations but no clear correlation between these responses and PCDD, PCDF, or PCB concentrations.

AB  - Baker Creek drains water from subarctic Canadian Shield terrain comprised of a mix of exposed Precambrian bedrock, lakes, open black spruce forest and peat filled depressions. Research in the catchment has focused on hydrological processes at the hillslope and catchment scales. Streamflow is gauged from several diverse sub-catchments ranging in size from 9 to 155 km(2). The period of record (2003-2019) of streamflow from these sub-catchments extends from 12 to 17 years, and these data are the focus of this note. Such data are unique in this remote region. 2003-2019 was a period that included both historic wet and dry conditions. Observations during such a diversity of conditions are helping to improve understanding of how stream networks that drain this landscape expand and contract in response to short and long hydroclimatic cycles. These data from a distinctly cold and dry region of low relief, thin soils, exposed bedrock and permafrost are a valuable contribution to the global diversity of research catchment data.

AB  - Waveform tomography, a combination of traveltime tomography (or inversion) and waveform inversion, is applied to vibroseis first-arrival data to generate an interpretable model of P-wave velocity for a site in the Nechako Basin, south-central British Columbia, Canada. We use constrained 3D traveltime inversion followed by 2D full-waveform inversion to process long-offset (14.4 km) first-arrival refraction waveforms, resulting in a velocity model of significantly higher detail than a conventional refraction-statics model generated for a processing workflow. The crooked-line acquisition of the data set makes 2D full-waveform inversion difficult. Thus, a procedure that improves the tractability of waveform tomography processing of vibroseis data recorded on crooked roads is developed to generate a near-surface (< 2 km) velocity model for the study area. The data waveforms are first static corrected using a time shift determined by 3D raytracing, which accounts for the crossline offsets produced by the crooked-line acquisition. The velocity model generated from waveform tomography exhibits substantial improvement when compared with a conventional refraction-statics model. It also shows improved resolution of sharp discontinuities and low-velocity regions when compared to the model from traveltime tomography alone, especially in regions where the geometry errors are moderate. Interpretation of the near-surface velocity model indicates possible subbasins in the Nechako Basin and delineates the Eocene volcanic rocks of the study area. This approach limits the ability of the full-waveform inversion to fit some propagation modes; however, the tractability of the inversion in the near-surface region is improved. This new development is especially useful in studies that do not warrant 3D seismic acquisition and processing.

AB  - We describe the phenology and mechanisms of pollen-cone and seed-cone development in lodgepole pine in the interior of British Columbia and the methods for monitoring cone phenology, pollination, seed production, and causes of seed and cone losses in seed orchards over the 15-month reproductive cycle. Pollination lasted about 2 weeks, between mid-May and mid-June. Pollen shedding and female receptivity showed homogamy, protandry, or protogyny depending on weather, site, and year. Morphological and developmental features explain why pollination as early as stage 3 was most successful and why self-pollination led to a seriously reduced production of filled seed. Early pollination increased the seed potential per cone and consequently the filled seed per cone. Cone drop occurred when less than 80% of ovules were pollinated per cone and was higher in trees from Prince George than those in the Okanagan Valley. Misting of trees and mechanical blowing of pollen in the orchards did not increase filled seed per cone. Clonal effect was the most important factor in all trials and has implications for orchard management.

AB  - Pre-commercial thinning (PCT) is a silvicultural practice that can provide diverse understory and overstory vegetation conditions. We tested the hypothesis that relative habitat use by snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and moose (Alces alces) would increase in response to enhanced abundance of herbs and shrubs, and species diversity and structural diversity of conifers, in heavily thinned (<= 1000 stems/ha) stands, at 12-15 years post-thinning. Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three young pine stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 stems/ha (low), similar to 1000 stems/ha (medium), and similar to 2000 stems/ha (high), with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Relative habitat use, based on counts of fecal pellets and pellet-groups, was similar among the five treatment stands for hares (P = 0.24), deer (P = 0.23), and moose (P = 0.16). However, low-density stands (similar to 500 stems/ha) had ca. 3-20 times as many deer pellet-groups, and ca. 2-4 times as many moose pellet-groups, than other stands. Low-density stands had significantly greater canopy openness, volume of shrubs < 2 m, and horizontal hiding cover < 1.6 m than other treatments. Relative habitat use by deer and moose was positively related to understory characteristics such as enhanced abundance of forage and security cover. These results support our hypothesis that deer and moose responded positively to enhanced volume of herbs and shrubs as well as to species diversity and structural diversity of conifers and overall vegetation in heavily thinned (<= 1000 stems/ha) stands at 12-15 years post-thinning. Our results suggest that ungulate management would be enhanced if greater emphasis was placed on forage enhancement throughout the year, which differs from current management recommendations which tend to focus on winter range and snow-interception cover.

AB  - Above-canopy, wind-assisted mountain pine beetle (MPB) dispersion in British Columbia (BC) is examined during the summer 2005 beetle emergence period. Above-canopy dispersion is simulated by the HYSPLIT atmospheric dispersion model using back trajectories started from locations identified by clear-air returns from the Prince George BC weather radar station. The dispersion calculations are carried out over the 10 days showing the highest intensity of clear-air returns from the 2005 emergence season. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used to simulate the meteorological conditions during each of the 10 emergence days. Cumulative clear-air returns throughout each emergence day are used to estimate the distribution of beetle emergence times and atmospheric residence times. Evaluation of the WRF model output is presented using both surface and upper air observations. Evaluation of the HYSPLIT model is performed through a comparison of the vertical distribution of MPB observed in a previous study. A secondary HYSPLIT evaluation is performed using aerial surveys taken during the following summer (2006), which identify the previous years' beetle-infested regions. Beetle flight distances from the time of beetle emergence to the time of peak clear-air returns are calculated for each trajectory, and the distribution of all flight distances is presented. The mean back trajectory distance is 20.2 km with a standard deviation of 13.6 km. These values represent the MPB flight distance during half of the beetle atmospheric residence time, and typical daily wind-assisted dispersion distances would be expected to be roughly double this value. Mean beetle residence time in the atmosphere over the 10 emergence events is found to be 3.2 h.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the ability of the Health Utility Index-Mark III (HUI-Mark III) to provide a summary measure of the physical, mental and social dimensions of health assessed in the 1994/5 National Population Health Survey (NPHS). The sample consisted of 838 (402 male, 436 female) randomly selected residents of Prince George, British Columbia. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted using the measures of physical, psychological and social health included in the NPHS. The HUI-Mark III scores were then regressed on to the factors in an attempt to determine the proportion of variance in factor scores accounted for by the HUI-Mark III. The results suggest that the HUI-Mark III is primarily a measure of physical impairment that does not adequately represent the physical, mental and social dimensions of health as measured in the NPHS.

AB  - This study examines the effect on stand and catchment scale snow processes due to widespread forest disturbance by the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation, for the 1570 km(2) Baker Creek catchment in the B.C. interior where all healthy mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands which dominated the catchment up until 2000 have since died or been salvage logged. Measurements in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this net canopy reduction has reduced peak snowpack and melt rate differences between remaining stands (including large clearcuts, younger regenerating stands and dead mature pine stands), relative to a healthy forest canopy with smaller clearcuts. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was calibrated and run at 200 m resolution across the catchment, and simulated snowmelt rates and snow-covered area compared relatively well to distributed satellite or ground-based measurements. Snowpack and ablation rates were 10-20% higher during the 2008 and 2009 winters than when running the model for the pre-MPB landscape in 2000 using the same input meteorological data, resulting in almost no difference in the snowcover period. A greater snowpack volume which enters the stream network faster inevitably has implications for streamflows, flood risks and water resources, and these are assessed during the next stage of this research project.

AB  - Heat flow increases northward along Intermontane Belt in the western Canadian Cordillera, as shown by geothermal differences between Bowser and Nechako sedimentary basins, where geothermal gradients and heat flows are similar to 30 mK/m and similar to 90 mW/m(2) compared to similar to 32 mK/m and 70 -80 mW/m(2), respectively. Sparse temperature profile data from these two sedimenatary basins are consistent with an isostatic model of elevation and crustal parameters, which indicate that Bowser basin heat flow should be similar to 20 mW/m(2) greater than Nechako basin heat flow. Paleothermometric indicators record a significant northward increasing Eocene or older erosional denudation, up to similar to 7 km. None of the heat generation, tectonic reorganization at the plate margin, or erosional denudation produce thermal effects of the type or magnitude that explain the north-south heat flow differences between Nechako and Bowser basins. The more southerly Nechako basin, where heat flow is lower, has lower mean elevation, is less deeply eroded, and lies opposite the active plate margin. In contrast, Bowser basin, where heat flow is higher, has higher mean elevation, is more deeply eroded, and sits opposite a transform margin that succeeded the active margin similar to 40 Ma. Differences between Bowser and Nechako basins contrast with the tectonic history and erosion impacts on thermal state. Tectonic history and eroded sedimentary thickness suggest that Bowser basin lithosphere is cooling and contracting relative to Nechako basin lithosphere. This effect has reduced Bowser basin heat flow by similar to 10-20 mW/m(2) since similar to 40 Ma. Neither can heat generation differences explain the northerly increasing Intermontane Belt heat flow. A lack of extensional structures in the Bowser basin precludes basin and range-like extension. Therefore, another, yet an unspecified mechanism perhaps associated with the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, contributes additional heat. Bowser basin's paleogeothermal gradients were higher, similar to 36 mK/m, before the Eocene and this might affect petroleum and metallogenic systems.

AB  - The Bed load Movement Detector (BMD) is installed on the O'Ne-ell Creek, a gravel bed stream, with a forced pool-riffle morphology, in the upper Fraser River basin in northern British Columbia, Canada. The device records the passage of individual particles across the full width of the channel. At the peak of the 1999 nival flood sediment movement, approximately 3 x 10(-5) particle passages per hour were detected. The transport rate increases as the stage and water discharge increase. Bed load movement in this flood involved nearly all of the stream bed, but the point of most intense transport varied across the channel throughout the flood. During one week of flood discharge, 14.41 x 10(6) particles were recorded passing the BMD. We estimate that this is approximately equivalent to 7.88 m(3). Pulses of sediment movement are apparent at a variety of time scales ranging from diurnal to seconds. While the spasmodic character of the sediment transport is most pronounced at scales of 5 min to 1 h, there is no stable periodicity in the record.

AB  - This study was designed to evaluate changes in plant biomass, species richness, and diversity after application of glyphosate herbicide in several successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Vegetation was sampled in replicate control (reference) and treatment blocks of ''herb,'' ''shrub,'' and ''shrub-tree'' stages of cutover forest habitats. Volume of herb layers declined temporarily in the first post-treatment year. Shrub layers were reduced in herb and shrub stages, and shrubs and trees were reduced temporarily in the shrub-tree stage. Species richness of herbs and shrubs was similar in control and treatment blocks in the herb successional stage, but shrub richness declined on the treatment in the shrub stage. There were no consistent differences in numbers of herb, shrub, or tree species between control and treatment blocks in the shrub-tree stage. Species diversity (Simpson's index and Shannon-Wiener function) of herbaceous plants was not affected by herbicide application in any of the successional stages, but diversity of shrubs was lower in treatment than control blocks in the herb and shrub stages. Diversity of trees was reduced on treatment blocks in the shrub-tree stage. Species abundance curves of overall plant communities showed little change in the herb stage, a decline in the first post-treatment year in the shrub and shrub-tree stages, with similar patterns between control and treatment blocks in subsequent post-treatment years. The general lack of community-wide reductions in plant biomass and diversity, and the short-term duration of specific changes, suggest that conifer release treatments of plantations have no substantial, incremental effects on wildlife habitat.

AB  - The advance of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) towards its Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) configuration and its subsequent retreat remain poorly understood. We use the glacial landform record to determine ice dynamics for the central sector of the CIS in northern British Columbia, Canada, beneath the LGM ice divide. We classify seventy ice-flow indicator flowsets based on morphology, elevation, orientation and cross-cutting relationships into one of three stages, whereby stage 1 is oldest and stage 3 youngest. Combined with ice-contact geomorphology, our reconstruction highlights complex changes in ice flow over time as a result of ice divide migrations through the LGM and deglacial phases. The orientation and distribution of landforms indicates active post-LGM ice retreat westward through the Cassiar and Omineca mountains. We map the regional distribution of independent mountain glaciers, ice caps, and ice fields that regrew during a cooling event in the Late Glacial and show that some of these readvance glaciers were subsequently overrun by advancing outlet glaciers of the CIS. We use the cross-cutting relationship between readvance glaciers and CIS outlet glaciers and available chronological data to reconstruct the eastern CIS margin during the Late Glacial for the first time. ?? 2022 The Authors.

AB  - River ice often forms in the cold regions of northern hemisphere which can lead to ice jams (or ice dams). Water level can be significantly raised due to ice jams. As a consequence, disastrous ice flooding may be resulted, such as the ice jam flooding in the Nechako River in Prince George in winter 2007-2008. In the present study, the equations describing the ice jam thickness in the transverse direction are derived. The impact of the secondary vortex is considered while the cohesive force within ice cubes is neglected in the model. The relationship between the parameter beta and the total water depth is established based on the assumption that all other variables except the velocities are kept constant on the same cross section. By using the parameter beta and the developed equations, the ice jam thickness in the transverse direction can be predicted. The developed model is used to simulate the ice jam thickness in the transverse direction at the Hequ Reach of the Yellow River in China. The simulated ice jam thicknesses agree well with the field measurements on different cross sections.

AB  - This is a report of the results of a survey of citizen beliefs and attitudes about public services and the quality of life in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada in the summer of 1997. Information is provided about the perceived frequency with which various services were used, the perceived satisfaction and value for tax dollars spent on the services as well as on levels of government officials generally, preferences for the provision of more or fewer services and for spending relatively more or less revenue on different services, views about user-fees, and views about smoke-free public places and the likely impact of bylaw changes on people's behaviour. Using such information, we examined correlations among perceived satisfaction, perceived value for money, use, spending preferences and demand, and, using multiple regression analysis, explained 66% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, 57% of the variance in satisfaction with the quality of life scores and 37% of the variance in happiness scores. Applying LISREL 8.14, it was shown that a model in which our three global indicators were explained by 13 domain indicators was superior to a model in which the latter indicators were explained by the former, i.e., a Bottom-Up model was superior to a Top-Down model. A simple linear model was also used to explain 32%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of the variance in satisfaction with municipal, provincial and federal government officials.

AB  - Enhanced growth of crop trees and development of late-seral structural characteristics in second-growth stands in temperate and boreal forest zones could be achieved by silvicultural practices such as pre-commercial thinning (PCT). This study was designed to test the hypotheses that large-scale stand thinning, at a 15-year period after PCT, would enhance: (i) productivity and structural features (crown volume, diameter, height, and volume growth of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) crop trees); and (ii) coniferous stand structure (abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers). Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 stems/ha (low), similar to 1000 stems/ha (medium), and similar to 2000 stems/ha (high), with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. An overall analysis of tree growth in thinned stands, across these regional replicates, indicated that lodgepole pine grew significantly faster in mean diameter in the low- than either of the medium- or high-density stands. There was no difference in mean height growth among stand densities over the 15-year period since PCT. Mean tree volume increment was significantly higher in the low-density than in the high-density stands. Mean stand volume increment (m(3)/ha) was similar in the medium-density (108.53) and high-density (132.51) stands, both of which were significantly higher than the low-density stands (72.88). Mean crown volume of crop trees was significantly greater in the low-density (52.8 m(3)) and medium-density (42.9 m(3)) stands than in the high-density (27.8 m(3)), unthinned (11.7 m(3)), or old-growth stands (30.9 m(3) pine only). This measure of crown size was similar among pine trees in the low-density, medium-density, and all conifers (43.2 m 3) in the old-growth stands. Other measurements of crown architecture followed this same pattern. Mean densities of understory trees were similar among stands for height classes up to 3 m. Mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers were highest in the low- and medium-density stands than in other treatment stands. Our results support the hypotheses that PCT enhances productivity (diameter and volume growth, but not height growth) and structural features (crown architecture) of young lodgepole pine, as well as diversity of coniferous tree layers in thinned stands. Accelerated development of some structural features of late-seral forest appeared in our young managed stands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Quantitative genetic variation in growth, latewood percentage, and wood density was investigated for British Columbia's interior spruce (the common name for white spruce, Picea glauca (Moench) Voss Engelmann spruce, Picea engelmanni Parry ex Engelm.: and their hybrids). The study included 100 half-sib families from the East Kootenay and Prince George regions. At the time of sampling, progeny tests for those two regions were 20 and 22 years old, respectively. Univariate and multivariate restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of genetic parameters were obtained. Estimates of genetic variances and heritabilities differed greatly across planting sites for the examined traits, especially after transplantation between the regions, Significant negative genetic correlation between overall growth and wood density was found for the East Kootenay progenies, while negative but nonsignificant genetic correlation between these traits was found for the Prince George progenies. Generally, there was no significant decrease in heritability for ring width and latewood percentage in successive growth rings. A general age trend for genetic correlation between those traits was not apparent, except that the correlation remained negative during the observed period. Our results show that it is not possible to select certain families as superior based on 1-year results because of the family by growing season interactions. Nevertheless, genetic age-age correlations for cumulative increments were high, having a decreasing trend with increasing difference in age.

In light of the lack of consensus regarding appropriate functional form of a hedonic price function, a linear model is estimated and a battery of diagnostic tests of model adequacy is performed. Two estimation procedures are used, namely, ordinary least squares (OLS) and Least Absolute Deviation (LAD). The estimation results are used to form appropriate valuations of characteristics of residential houses in Prince George.

AB  - The molybdenum conversion facility at Endako processes in excess of 14 million pounds of molybdenum (Mo) per year. Current practice exploits procedures and experience developed since the commencement of operations during 1965. This paper describes the current roasting practice and facilities as well as several associated processes, i.e. concentrate leaching to remove calcium from the roaster feed, concentrate drying in a multi-hearth dryer, the packaging of calcine into metal containers, the production of briquettes, and the treatment of roaster off-gas to recover dust and remove sulphur oxides. The Endako operation consists of two Nichols roasters - a 16-foot-diameter, 10-hearth unit and an 18-footdiameter, 12-hearth unit. Operating time of these units is in excess of 97%. The major influences responsible for achieving this availability are improved rabble design, scheduled on-line plowing of hearths and an aggressive preventive maintenance program. Endako is a prime producer of technical-grade molybdenum trioxide, the product having very low concentrations of minor-element irnpurities.

AB  - Management options for Pacific salmon (Oncouhynchus spp.) populations are often analyzed using stochastic simulations that project spawner and recruit abundances over time. These forward simulations are commonly based on "best-fit" parameter estimates of the Ricker stock-recruitment relationship, despite the fact that such estimates are often highly uncertain. To examine if explicitly accounting for parameter uncertainty using Bayesian methods would affect the results of forward simulations, we compared simulations based on best-fit Ricker parameters to simulations where parameter uncertainty was incorporated through a Bayesian formulation with noninformative priors. Forward simulations using fixed harvest rates were conducted using data for two stocks of Fraser River sockeye (O. nerka) salmon. We found that expected values of spawner and recruit projections for the Bayesian simulations were consistently larger than projections for the best-fit case. Increases in the Bayes projections over those of the best-fit case typically ranged from 5 to 15% for the Stellako stock, and 20 to 60% for the Late Stuart stock. However, these differences were largely attributable to low values of the Ricker beta parameter that were included in the Bayesian prior distribution. Results of Bayesian simulations were found to be highly sensitive to changes in the lower bound of the prior on beta. We conclude that the common approach of specifying noninformative priors by extending uniform distributions across a broad range of parameter values can be inappropriate for the Ricker model, and recommend the use of informative priors whenever possible.

AB  - Recent regional mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks have generated unprecedented tree mortality across the fire-prone landscapes of western North American forests and could potentially modify fire severity and postfire ecological effects. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, three fires burned through high mortality, gray-phase lodgepole pine-dominated forests in the plateau regions of central interior British Columbia, Canada, providing an opportunity to test for interactions between MPB outbreaks and wildfires. We inventoried 63 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, fire severity, and burning conditions in a wilderness setting. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of outbreak severity on fire severity by assessing typical first-order fire effects as well as legacy structure related to the consumption of woody biomass on snags/trees. We found no evidence of a relationship between outbreak severity and fire severity for six of seven first-order fire effects, with the exception of deep charring. We found evidence that legacy structure in the form of consumed branch structure and deep char development had greater odds of occurrence on MPB-killed snags compared to trees killed during wildfire. Our results indicate two key findings. First, fire severity as it relates to most first-order fire effects measures is not influenced by outbreak severity, instead it is more strongly influenced by the interaction of fuels, weather, and topography during fire events. Second, our results highlight how the interaction between outbreak severity and fire severity alters postfire structural legacies and their functional attributes, which could have important ecosystem implications.

AB  - In order to provide better estimates of the thermal-induced stress encountered by salmon migrating to their spawning grounds, a model is used to hindcast temperatures throughout the mainstem Fraser and Thompson Rivers back to 1953. Tributary and headwater temperatures that are not available prior to 1993 are estimated with both linear regression and neural network techniques. The average root mean square difference between model temperatures and those observed at Hell's Gate, on the lower Fraser River, is computed to be 1.12 degreesC. Historical flow and temperature observations are also used to establish patterns and trends for the Fraser River watershed. The Julian day numbers by which one-third and one-half of the integrated yearly discharge had occurred were computed and found to be progressing earlier at the rates of 0.11 and 0.09 days per year, respectively. Both values are significant at the 95% level. Average summer Hell's Gate temperatures from 1941 to 1998 are warming at the rate of 0.012 degreesC per year, though the relatively large standard error of 0.008 degreesC means that this result is not significantly different from zero at the 95% level. However, when the analysis is restricted to 1953 to 1998, the trend becomes 0.022 degreesC per year and the significance level rises to 98%. An analysis of the 1953-98 atmosphere-to-river heat exchange at Kamloops and Prince George produces positive increases of 0.52 W m(-2) per year and 0.90 W m(-2) per year, respectively. When these trends are used to force the river temperature model, they explain approximately 35% of the 1953-98 temperature increase at Hell's Gate. An additional 20% is explained by related increases in the headwater and tributary temperatures. Though these estimates have considerable statistical uncertainty, they nevertheless suggest that most of the river warming can be attributed to climatic effects. Flow rates and river temperatures are also shown to exhibit significant differences in the summers following El Nino and La Nina winters. On average, during the summers following El Nino events, flows are approximately 800 m(3) s(-1) smaller and river temperatures are approximately 0.9 degreesC higher on the lower Fraser River. Similar estimates are produced for the major tributaries and headwaters of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers. The implications for future salmon recruitment are briefly discussed.

AB  - In 1996 we initiated a study to evaluate several techniques for measuring light under broadleaf canopies. Hourly average photosynthetic photon flux density and percent transmittance were measured 1 m above the ground at four points in each of three canopy densities created by a spacing experiment in a 35-year-old paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) dominated stand located near Prince George, B.C. At each point, fisheye photographs were taken and LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer (LAI-2000), spherical densiometer, and competition index (Lorimer's index) measurements were made. Percent transmittance measurements on an overcast day (l-h average), transmittance measured over periods of 3 h or longer on a clear day, LAI-2000 diffuse noninterceptance measurements, and gap light index determined from fisheye photographs were strongly correlated with growing season percent transmittance (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.96) as was competition index (r(2) = 0.928). Concave spherical densiometer measurements and midday percent transmittance measurements on clear days were also well correlated with measured percent transmittance (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.89). Estimates of understory light by the LITE model were strongly correlated with growing season percent transmittance. Correlations improved with increasing length of the period simulated (r(2) = 0.755 for a point measurement on a clear day; r(2) = 0.936 for an entire sunny day; and, r(2) = 0.953 for the entire growing season). However, this version of the model underestimated percent transmittance in these spaced birch stands by 34-90%.

AB  - Aggregate resources play an essential role in the urban development of most countries. Conflict arises where competing land-use options, dwindling resources and growing development needs, attempt to coexist without prior information on the location of local aggregate resources. As a result, the BC Geological Survey Branch has developed a methodology to provide a "first approximation" of aggregate resource potential. This methodology can be readily adapted elsewhere and integrated into future resource management plans. This paper outlines the methodology used in generating 1:50,000 scale Level-III 'aggregate potential maps'. It involves an area of about 4500 km(2) centred on Prince George, BC. Parameters used to evaluate aggregate potential include landform type, gravel/sand, deposit volume, overburden thickness, historical activity, etc. A weighted algorithm was used to determine the rank categories. The final product is a digital database and digital map product which can be used in any GIS environment.

AB  - This article presents the development of a sub-hourly database of hydrometeorological conditions collected in British Columbia's (BC's) Cariboo Mountains and surrounding area extending from 2006 to present. The Cariboo Alpine Mesonet (CAMnet) forms a network of 11 active hydrometeorological stations positioned at strategic locations across mid- to high elevations of the Cariboo Mountains. This mountain region spans 44 150 km(2), forming the northern extension of the Columbia Mountains. Deep fjord lakes along with old-growth western redcedar and hemlock forests reside in the lower valleys, montane forests of Engelmann spruce, lodge-pole pine and subalpine fir permeate the mid-elevations, while alpine tundra, glaciers and several large ice fields cover the higher elevations. The automatic weather stations typically measure air and soil temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall and snow depth at 15 min intervals. Additional measurements at some stations include shortwave and longwave radiation, near-surface air, skin, snow, or water temperature, and soil moisture, among others. Details on deployment sites, the instrumentation used and its precision, the collection and quality control process are provided. Instructions on how to access the database at Zenodo, an online public data repository, are also furnished (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1195043). Information on some of the challenges and opportunities encountered in maintaining continuous and homogeneous time series of hydrometeorological variables and remote field sites is provided. The paper also summarizes ongoing plans to expand CAMnet to better monitor atmospheric conditions in BC's mountainous terrain, efforts to push data online in (near-)real time, availability of ancillary data and lessons learned thus far in developing this mesoscale network of hydrometeorological stations in the data-sparse Cariboo Mountains.

AB  - The utility of teaching reading using rime-based reading strategies with prereaders was examined. Two experiments are presented that studied the effects of a rime-based reading program with First Nations prereaders; one experiment with Shuswap kindergartners and the other with Heiltsuk Grade 1 children. Rhyming, phoneme identity, letter-sound knowledge, phonological working memory, First Nations language speaking ability, and reading were measured. In the Shuswap group, the reading program increased the abilities that were specifically taught, rhyming, initial phoneme identity, letter-sounds, and word reading by rime-analogy, compared to the control group. Children also developed abilities that were not specifically taught, final phoneme identity and reading by letter recoding, and could use the rime-analogy strategy to read words with unfamiliar rime endings. Phonological working memory remained unchanged. The Heiltsuk children gained in reading compared to a Grade 1 comparison group. Pretest letter-sound knowledge and rhyming were related to later reading but phoneme identity and First Nations language ability were not. Progress in phonological awareness and word reading can be enhanced in prereaders by adding experience with rime-based strategies to the reading program.

AB  - Blinding of brownstock Cowan screen plates with pitch, and dirt contamination of finished products, led the Prince George Pulp and Paper Mills' Prince George mill to an overall reassessment of the mill pitch control methods. Elimination of fresh water makeup, skimming and sewering reclaimed fines from the brown white water chest virtually eliminated all pitch-related problems. In addition, Vibromixer pitch deposition tests developed by Paprican were used to evaluate the effectiveness and necessity of using liquid pitch dispersants. Addition points and application rates have been redefined with no recurrence of the problems.

AB  - Field data, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model, and modal decomposition were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in two interconnected multiarm lakes, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes (British Columbia, Canada). Similar to lakes of simpler geometry, the first-vertical first-horizontal mode (V1H1) of Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes was found to be the most energetic mode. This V1H1 dominance is attributed to similarity between the relatively uniform distributions of along-thalweg wind and surface-layer flow for the V1H1 mode. Two bathymetric features, the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and changes in thalweg orientation relative to the wind field act to create subbasins in which wind forcing causes local metalimnetic tilts. These subbasin scale tilts deepen the metalimnion at the downwind ends of the subbasins, raise the metalimnion at the upwind ends, and are superimposed on the lake-wide V1H1 tilt. The metalimnetic tilts in the subbasins are attributed to higher horizontal modes that are equivalent to V1H1 modes of the subbasins. Because the thickness of the metalimnion is significant, the subbasin metalimnetic tilts occur with variations in the metalimnetic thickness along the subbasins; the metalimnion is compressed at the downwind end and expanded at the other end of each subbasin. This variability in thickness leads to metalimnetic intrusions following the relaxation of wind forcing. The findings of this study contribute to characterizing the baroclinic response to wind in lakes of complex bathymetry. In particular, this study helps in understanding the effect of bathymetric features on modal composition of the baroclinic response.

AB  - 1 A lodgepole pine seed orchard at the Prince George Tree Improvement Station (PGTIS), with up to 60% of grafted trees attacked by the Warren root collar weevil Hylobius warreni was investigated to determine whether relative monoterpene composition or scion : rootstock interactions of grafts affected susceptibility to attack. 2 There was a significant relationship between relative levels of alpha-pinene, beta-thujene, beta-pinene, delta-3-carene and limonene in scion and rootstock in unattacked trees, indicating a potential effect of the scion monoterpene composition on their composition in the rootstock. 3 Relative content of delta-3-carene and beta-phellandrene differed significantly in root stocks of attacked and unattacked trees but, for individual clones, a significant difference was only detected for beta-phellandrene in one clone. delta-3-Carene levels may have been too low in the examined trees to exert a strong effect. 4 Interestingly, attack status was significantly associated with two scion monoterpenes: alpha-thujene and alpha-terpinolene, both of which had higher levels in unattacked than in attacked trees. 5 Warren root collar weevils appear largely unaffected by monoterpene content, but further study is required to determine whether high levels of delta-3-carene imparts some level of resistance to attack, and to verify whether the observed effects of scion monoterpenes are real or artefacts of the analysis. 6 Hylobius warreni-attacked trees had smaller scion : rootstock diameter ratio (i.e. a large rootstock diameter relative to the scion diameter) than unattacked trees. This effect was consistent among clones, and was not due to the absolute diameter of the rootstock or the scion. Trees with increased diameter-growth at the root collar (e.g. some grafted trees) may have increased susceptibility to attack by H. warreni, or diameter-growth at the root collar is affected by the attack.

AB  - Indigenous mental health research is beginning to address colonization, however, Indigenous approaches to wellness have largely been overlooked. There is a paucity of research exploring psychological trauma interventions with Indigenous peoples. The Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs recognize the profound impacts of historical trauma among their people and are utilizing Indigenous focusing oriented therapy (IFOT), a trauma model that is collective, land-based, and intergenerational, as a part of their wellness framework. This collaborative research study explored the question: How is IFOT shaped by Wet'suwet'en ways of knowing and mobilized by individuals, families, house groups, and the Nation? Wet'suwet'en IFOT practitioners participated in sharing circles for data collection and interpretation. The exploratory findings revealed that the strategic application of IFOT by Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs created a culturally relevant model for land-based healing wherein Wet'suwet'en people were able to experience greater connection with their own yintah (land) and c'idede' (history).

AB  - Little is known about the effect of seed source and nursery culture on the growth and performance of artificially regenerated paper birch planted in the field. In the summer of 2000, trees were vertically uprooted in Prince George, BC using a tripod and winch device to determine if seed source and nursery culture significantly affected the root strength of 5-year-old paper birch. Trees from a seed source in the Skeena region had the greatest uprooting resistance, and the most root biomass, but the least root strength compared to the other three seed sources tested. The Skeena trees may be exhibiting an adaptive strategy which provides maximum root reinforcement across a wide range of environments. Uprooting resistance was similar for the 415D stocktypes grown at Red Rock and Kalamalka nurseries. However, trees grown in 515A styroblock at Kalamalka had the least uprooting resistance and root biomass of all treatments. In addition, the relationship between uprooting resistance and ground line diameter was different between nurseries. The results of this study suggest that regardless of height and diameter leaving the nursery, seed source root resistance and growth continued to be impacted by nursery culture 5 years after planting.

AB  - Tree height and number of western gall rust (caused by Endocronartium harknessii (J.P. Moore) Hirat.) bole and branch infections per living tree were recorded in three experimental 7-year-old lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.) plantations located near Fort St. James, Mackenzie, and Fort St. John, B.C. An extra set of data for trees originating from north of 60 degrees N was also taken at Fort St. John. Each plantation consisted of 40 types of genetic material (i.e., different parentage and latitude of origin), while the extra set at Fort St. John consisted of 17 types of genetic material. The 4357 trees examined had an average of 1.81 gall rust infections per tree, and 49.1% of all trees were infected. Ninety percent of all infections originated in a single year (1990). The number of galls per unit target area declined with increasing height above ground. The percentage of galls located on the hole was 3.10, 10.53, 8.03, and 9.88% for the four populations, respectively. The number of western gall rust infections per tree was linearly related to tree height. The number of infections on boles did not vary with tree height, but the proportion of all infections located on the bole was linearly related to the reciprocal of tree height. The proportion of infections on the hole did not vary significantly with infection severity. Finally, the proportion of galls on the bole did not differ significantly between types of genetic material.

Recent developments and availability of smaller capacity, modular STATCOMs have proved to be just as useful for utilities in addressing a wider array of problems-from voltage regulation of weak transmission systems to multiple just-in-time installations to prevent voltage collapse and improve system stability and reliability. BC Hydro, Vancouver Canada, recently installed a small STATCOM, an 8MVA D-VAR(TM) device, in their system at Fort St. James substation to prevent voltage collapse in the 66-kV long radial system and as a means to defer costly transmission reinforcement This paper outlines the system analysis, procurement, installation and performance of the D-VAR at Fort St. James along with modeling and other applications of small STATCOM devices such as D-VAR for transmission and distribution applications.

AB  - Leeches (Nephelopsis obscura Verrill) were evaluated as ill situ biomonitors of chlorinated phenolic compounds in the Fraser River al Prince George, BC, downstream from three bleached kraft pulp mills practising chlorine dioxide (ClO2) substitution. Five biomonitoring periods, of 7 days duration, were selected to cover a full range of seasonal river conditions. Leeches bioconcentrated tri- and tetrachlorinated phenolics (bioconcentration factors: 465-6000) in proportions similar to those present in both mill effluent and river water. Leeches showed 3,4,5-trichloroguaiacol (3,4,5-TCG) to be the most consistent tracer of bleached kraft mill discharge. Leeches provided direct evidence that increasing ClO2 substitution reduces amounts of chlorinated phenolics accumulated by aquatic organisms, with sharp decreases observed at ClO2 levels greater than 90%. This study suggests that leeches could be applied as routine biomonitors for environmental impact monitoring. Copyright (C) 1996 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature and seed-source elevation on heightGrowth phenology of three co-occurring and ecologically distinct northern conifers (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia (lodgepole pine), Picea glauca (Moench) Voss x Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. (interior spruce) and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. (subalpine fir)). Seed from populations of the three indigenous and co-occurring species was collected across an elevational transect on the southwestern slope of McBride Peak, near Prince George, BC. Collection sites were at elevations of 750 to 1850 m, the latter being close to the tree line. In 2003, seeds were germinated and seedlings raised under favorable growing conditions in a temperature controlled glasshouse. In 2004, seedlings of each population were grown in natural daylengths at a location within 50 km of the seed collection site both in a temperature-control led glasshouse and at a nearby field site, and height growth was recorded twice a week throughout the growing season. Species differed in both the date and the accumulated heat sum above 5 degrees C for the initiation and cessation of shoot extension. Growth durations (which integrate growth initiation and growth cessation) were more similar among species in the field than in the glasshouse. This suggests that different mechanisms of phenological control among co-occurring species can result in adaptive "equivalence" under a particular set of climatic conditions.

AB  - This study was designed to assess the influence of forest applications of glyphosate herbicide on reproduction, growth, and survival in snowshoe hare (Lepus numericanus Erxleben) populations in control (reference) and treatment habitats near Prince George, B.C. Proportion of adult hares in breeding condition and number of successful pregnancies showed no consistent differences between control and treatment populations. Recruitment of hares was generally similar except for significantly more juvenile females entering the control than treatment population at one study area. At a second study area, total recruitment was significantly higher in the treatment than control population for both sexes in 1990 and for adult females in 1991, the 2 post-treatment years. There was little difference in survival of hares between control and treatment populations. Lack of significant differences in mean body mass and growth rates suggested that this herbicide treatment had little or no effect on metabolic or general physiological processes in the development of young hares. Similar profiles of body mass distribution between control and treatment populations indicated that comparable levels of biomass of hares were available as prey for predators. Use of this forest herbicide did not measurably affect demographic parameters of snowshoe hare populations.

AB  - In British Columbia, sheep vegetation management (SVM) is a relatively new technique; thus, limited data are available for examining its benefits on conifer growth. We collected field data from young mixed-conifer plantations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and hybrid spruce (Picea glauca x P. engelmannii) in blocks which had been grazed in 2005 and 2006 as well as from ungrazed blocks. Our main objective was to determine if sheep grazing had a significant effect on the growth of hybrid spruce. We measured stem diameter at 15 cm height above the root collar (D15) and cumulative internodal length (IL). Cumulative IL was calculated from the node corresponding to the year 2002-2010 (positions 2-10). The height to diameter ratio (height to the base of the leader (position 10)/D15; HDR) was calculated to determine if seedlings prioritized growth in terms of height or diameter. There was no significant grazing treatment effect on D15 and HDR when compared to the control treatment; however IL was significantly affected after the second grazing treatment in 2006 (position 6) and became increasingly important with time (positions 7-10). Based on our results, we suggest that SVM could be an effective method for controlling competing vegetation and thus, increase annual tree growth for areas with similar site characteristics as those found within the plantations sampled.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the initiation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a community hospital versus a tertiary-care teaching hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTINGS: A general community hospital in Prince George, BC, and a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Vancouver. PATIENTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients in the community hospital and 318 patients in the tertiary-care centre. INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallbladder disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preparation of surgeons for the new technique, complication rates, operating time, conversion rates to open cholecystectomy and duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: All community surgeons tool; didactic and laboratory courses in preparation for the new procedure and assisted each other for their first 10 cases, but surgeons at the teaching hospital had more varied preparation that included additional extensive laboratory work and preceptorships with surgeons experienced with the procedure. The rates of major complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy were 6.5% at the community hospital compared with 5% at the tertiary-care centre. The rates of minor complications were 5.5% at community hospital and 5.3% at the tertiary-care centre. The rates of conversion to open cholecystectomy were 6.6% for the community hospital versus 4.7% for teaching hospital. The mean (and standard deviation) operating time was shorter at the community hospital than at the teaching hospital: 72.3 (30) minutes Versus 106 (32) minutes (p < 0.0001). The mean (SD) length of stay was 2.3 (1.8) days at the community hospital and 3.4 (1.9) days at the teaching hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy during a 2-year period was achieved safely at both hospitals. The complication rates were similar. The length of stay and operating times were shorter in the community hospital.

AB  - This paper presents the results of a linear model for global scale magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) waves in a compressed dipole model magnetosphere. We examine scenarios where a localized monochromatic source along the magnetopause boundary launches MHD fast mode ultralow frequency (ULF) waves into the magnetosphere, where they couple to shear Alfven waves. Sharply peaked field line resonance (FLR) structures are found to form at discrete locations within the magnetosphere in response to the fast mode driver. The extent in local time and relative amplitudes of FLR structures are found to depend strongly on the source location along the magnetopause boundary, indicating how the addition of day/night asymmetry affects the penetration of MHD fast waves within the magnetosphere. This also suggests that observed FLR structures within the magnetosphere may be used to deconvolve the spatial characteristics of the ULF wave source at the magnetopause, giving insight to the excitation mechanism responsible for observed ULF waves. As an example, we consider narrow band ULF activity observed on 25 November 2001 during a high solar wind speed interval following a geomagnetic storm and qualitatively reproduce the spatial and temporal characteristics of observations made by the Prince George SuperDARN radar by constraining the ULF wave source characteristics.

AB  - Airborne multi-spectral (CASI) imagery has been acquired for approximately 80,000 hectares in the Prince George Forestry Region in B.C. This work has included validation test area at the Inga Lake Experimental Test Site and a more operational test at Big Lake in the Dawson Creek District. The validation work showed that the CASI can reliably detect individual isolated conifers down to about 75 cm height provided there are no significant obscuring effects due to deciduous trees or shrubs. The conifers are detected using spectral signatures, Then a "well-spaced" mask is applied to remove stems that are too close to other stems. The forest cover polygons are imported digitally and stem densities are calculated for each polygon and output as attribute file for each polygon. The stem densities are also calculated locally using a circular kernel of 0.1 ha size. The resultant stem density maps show the high variability of stem densities within most forest cover polygons. Finally, an example of an OAF (Operational Adjustment Factor) calculation is shown. The OAF image is generated by superimposing a disk of 2.7m diameter on each identified well-spaced stem and then calculating the residual gaps.

AB  - Land cover change (LCC) studies are increasingly using deep learning (DL) modeling techniques. Past studies have leveraged temporal or spatiotemporal sequences of historical LC data to forecast changes with DL models. However, these studies do not adequately assess the association between neighborhood size and DL model capability to forecast LCCs, where neighborhood size refers to the spatial extent captured by each data sample. The objectives of this research study were to: (1) evaluate the effect of neighborhood size on the capacity of DL models to forecast LCCs, specifically Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-TCN), and (2) assess the effect of auxiliary spatial variables on model capacity to forecast LCCs. First, each model type and neighborhood setting configuration was assessed using data derived from multitemporal MODIS LC for the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako, Canada, comparing subareas exhibiting different amounts of LCCs with trends obtained for the full region. Next, outcomes were compared with three other study regions. The modeling results were evaluated with three-map comparison measures, where the real-world LC for the next timestep, the real-world LC for the previous timestep, and the forecasted LC for the next year were used to calculate correctly transitioned areas. Across all regions explored, it was observed that increasing neighborhood sizes improved the DL model's capabilities to forecast short-term LCCs. CNN-TCN models forecasted the most correct LCCs for several regions while reducing error due to quantity when provided additional spatial variables. This study contributes to the systematic exploration of neighborhood sizes on selected spatiotemporal DL techniques for geographic applications.

AB  - In this study, we report evidence proving the existence of a close relationship between the initial development of a poleward propagating feature of the HF radar backscatter, that is, HF radar polar patch, and a fast azimuthal flow in the cusp. We focus on two events in which the HF radar polar patch was formed and was identified by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars at Saskatoon, Canada, and Prince George, Canada, on 27 March 2001. We examine their spatial and temporal development. The two events occurred at the interface between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B-Y-controlled azimuthal flow and the antisunward flow typical of a negative IMF B-Z; they developed in a longitudinally asymmetric manner. The increase in vertical bar BY/BZ vertical bar when B-Z was negative triggered the fast azimuthal flow. We interpret the temporal and spatial development of the HF radar polar patch in terms of the plasma density gradient created by the azimuthal flow and in terms of the subsequent development of the gradient in the direction of both the azimuthal flow and the antisunward flow.

AB  - A method for 2.5D viscoacoustic waveform tomography that can be applied to generate 2D models of velocity and attenuation from inversion of refraction waveforms on land seismic reflection data acquired along crooked roads is developed. It is particularly useful for typical crustal reflection surveys. First-arrival travel time tomography is applied using a 3D method, but with constraints on the intermediate 3D velocity model; the result is the starting model for the next step. A 2.5D frequency-domain full-waveform inversion stage parameterizes 3D geometry in the seismic source and receiver arrays, with the assumption that the velocity and attenuation models are homogeneous in the out-of-plane direction. This approach results in superior results compared to a strictly 2D approach when the acquisition line is crooked, with a moderate increase in computational cost. A case study using data acquired in the Nechako Basin in south-central British Columbia, Canada, exemplifies and validates the procedure. The velocity model derived from 2.5D waveform tomography is compared with that from a previous study in which 2D waveform tomography was applied to the same data set and with results from 3D travel time tomography. The resolution and accuracy of the velocity model from 2.5D waveform tomography are demonstrated to be greater than those from travel time or 2D waveform tomography. A model of viscoacoustic attenuation, which was not possible in the 2D case, is also generated. These models are interpreted jointly to highlight features of geological interest, such as a sedimentary basin, basement rocks, and faults, from surface to about 3km depth.

AB  - For several years Environment Canada (EC) has carried out a program of water sampling at four stations along the Fraser River and at one station on each of its two principal tributaries, the Thompson and the Nechako. Samples collected at bi-weekly intervals have been analyzed by EC for major and some trace components. Seasonal variation in water composition mainly relates to changes in discharge, this being low during winter and high during early summer snowmelt. Dissolved constituents, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Sr, HCO3, SO4 and (NO3+NO2), show moderate variation, being least concentrated during maximum discharge, reflecting dilution of groundwater by melting snow. Factor analysis shows secondary seasonal variation for SO4, that is related to the importance of deep groundwater as a source, and for (NO3+NO2), precipitated with snow and released during snowmelt. Large amounts of Na and Cl are added in pulp mill effluent. A uniform flux of this effluent, superimposed on a highly variable river discharge, gives rise to greater seasonal variation for Na and Cl than other dissolved constituents. The trace constituents, Fe, Mn, Al, P and Sr, were analyzed by EC in unfiltered water samples by methods that extract the elements from suspended material. Except for Sr, these elements have a high partition factor in favor of suspended over dissolved phases; their results reflect seasonal changes in quantities of suspended material, which can vary by two orders of magnitude.

AB  - Almost every year, First Nations are evacuated in Canada because of wildfire proximity and smoke. Dynamics of wildfires, and remote locations, unique sociocultural characteristics, and limited emergency management resources present challenges for evacuation organizers and residents. This study explores how Dene Tha' First Nation evacuated their Tache community in July 2012 due to wildfire smoke and how the evacuation process affected evacuees. Interviews were completed with 31 evacuation organizers and residents to examine the factors that helped and hindered the evacuation process. Lack of information about the nearby wildfire, smoke, and evacuation of the nearby small community of Zama City, combined with a generic evacuation plan, delayed and posed challenges during the evacuation of this Dene Tha' community. Strong leadership and its role in community organizing, keeping families together, providing the social support they needed, and using familiar host communities, demonstrated and contributed to the community's resilience during the evacuation. Measures to improve evacuations and emergency management in the community and other First Nations in Canada are identified and discussed.

AB  - In their efforts I to deal with global climate change, scientists and governments have given much attention to the carbon 'emissions associated with fossil fuels and to strategies for reducing their use. While it is very important to burn less fossil fuel and to employ alternative energy sources, other carbon-reduction options must also be considered. Given that forests comprise a large portion of the global landbase and that they play a very significant role in the global carbon cycle, it is logical to examine how forest management practices could effect reductions in carbon emissions. Many papers that discuss forest carbon sinks or sources refer only to the short term (<20 years). This paper focuses on the sustainable carbon storage contributions of a forest over the long term. This paper explains that long-term carbon storage and reduced carbon fluctuation can be achieved by a combination of improved forest management and efficient transfer of carbon into wood products. Here we show how three different forest management scenarios affect the overall carbon storage capacity of forest and wood products combined over the long term. We used a timber supply model and scenario analysis to predict forest carbon and other resource conditions over time in the Prince George Forest District, a 3.4-million-ha landbase in northern British Columbia. We found that the high-harvest scenario stores 3% more carbon than the low-harvest scenario and 27% (120 million tonnes) more carbon than the no-harvest scenario even though only 1.2-million ha is in timber harvesting landbase. Our results tell us that forest management practices that maintain and increase forest area, reduce natural disturbances in the forest, improve forest conditions, and ensure the appropriate and timely transfer of carbon into wood products lead to increasing overall carbon storage, thereby reducing carbon in the atmosphere.

AB  - In 1987 the Government of Canada, the Province of British Columbia, and Alcan Aluminium Ltd. entered into a tripartite agreement establishing a program of measures to conserve chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye (Oncorhynchus nerka) salmon stocks in the Ncchako River. Large-scale applications of habitat measures are planned to manage the risks caused to chinook salmon by potential reductions in habitat quality associated with the reduction of flows. The reduction of flows result from the planned diversion of an additional portion of the upper Nechako River drainage. Experimental placements of debris structures and channel modifications were conducted from 1988 to 1993. Juvenile chinook salmon highly colonized debris structures, particularly the sweepers and rail-debris catchers installed in 1991, and fry density was similar to sparse natural debris cover. Channel modifications, point bars, and a side channel were durable, but were not as well utilized by young chinook. Physical assessment indicated that durability was medium to high where debris catchers and bundles withstood peak flows of 250-283 m(3)/s.

TI  - BC Sockeye Salmon Population Declines: Probable Causes and Recommended Response Strategies
TY  - report
AU  - David Levy
AB  - This report was prepared for the Sierra Club of Canada, BC Chapter to evaluate sockeye salmon biodiversity conservation in BC. Numerous BC sockeye populations are declining in abundance and many small populations have unknown status due to the absence of stock assessment information. Sockeye returning to Cultus and Sakinaw Lakes have been designated as “endangered” by COSEWIC and many other populations are potential candidates for listing. In Northern and Central BC, approximately 75% of sockeye populations are either depressed, declining or unknown status and at least 38 populations coast-wide are below 25% of their historical baseline level. Better stock assessment information is required to determine the actual number of depressed stocks and to inform management decisions. Factors that influence sockeye abundance include natural environmental variations and those induced by global warming. Sockeye in BC are captured in commercial, recreational and aboriginal fisheries and fishing is implicated in the declines of many smaller populations. Sockeye fisheries need to be structured so they do not endanger the persistence of small sockeye stocks.

TY  - report
AU  - James Jacklin
AB  - In British Columbia, drinking water quality is becoming a significant public issue. We all want to have confidence in the quality of the water we consume. Its protection is also important to local purveyors, who act as our water suppliers, and to provincial government ministries responsible for water management. Within the Omineca-Peace region of B.C., our most common potable source is ground water, although many communities do make use of rivers, streams or lakes. Our basic drinking water quality is determined by a number of factors including local geology, climate and hydrology. In addition to these, human land use activities such as urbanization, agriculture and forestry, and the pollution they may cause, are becoming increasingly important influences. Environmental managers have a responsibility to control land use development so as to minimise the effects of these activities on source water quality.

AB  - The general public and resort owners on Francois Lake have suggested that fishing success on the lake has been deteriorating over the past number of years. In response to this, the Fisheries Section of the Ministry of Environment and Parks (MOE) developed a study plan to conduct detailed surveys of major tributaries to Francois Lake as part of an overall program to assess the present condition of the lake's rainbow trout fisheries and to identify enhancement options. Other parts of the program include creel surveys on Francois Lake in 1987 and 1988, a Stellako River" creel survey in 1988, and a possible rainbow trout tagging program to be conducted in 1988 to identify some of the movement patterns of adult trout in the lake.

TI  - Assessment of Juvenile Sockeye Salmon rearing in Fraser Lake, British Columbia in the fall of 2020 using paired hydroacoustic and trawl survey methods
TY  - report
AU  - Lucas Pon
AU  - Garrett Lidin
AB  - A survey of juvenile Sockeye Salmon rearing in Fraser Lake was conducted in fall of 2020 using paired hydroacoustic and trawl methods. Total Sockeye Salmon fall fry abundance (± 95% CI) was estimated at 5,212,812 ± 2,028,465 fish. Sockeye were vertically distributed through much of the water column owing to the shallow nature of the lake, and densities were higher in the eastern third of the lake, becoming progressively lower towards the western end. All trawl-caught juvenile salmon that were genetically identified as Sockeye from the Stellako population, suggesting a low number of Kokanee in the lake relative to sympatric Sockeye Salmon. From all samples collected across the lake, the mean (± SD) fork length of juvenile Sockeye Salmon was 74.5 ± 5.9 mm, and weight was 4.68 ± 1.12 g. This was the third such survey of Fraser Lake in the last four years, but prior to 2017, the lake had not been surveyed since the late 1990’s. The renewed assessment effort in Fraser Lake follows on recommendations put forward in the Cohen Commission report, which identified the need to increase monitoring of Sockeye Salmon fall fry. With recent listing of Stellako Sockeye as a ‘Special Concern’ by COSEWIC in 2017, and the potential impacts from the slide at Big Bar on adult returns, continued monitoring and assessment of Sockeye Salmon that spawn in this system will be an important component of informed management and conservation.

AB  - Fish mercury (Hg) concentrations have been measured over the last 30–40 years in all regions of Canada as part of various monitoring and research programs. Despite this large amount of data, only regional assessments of fish Hg trends and patterns have previously been attempted. The objective of this study was to assemble available freshwater fish Hg concentration data from all provinces and territories and identify national patterns. The Canadian Fish Mercury Database includes over 330 000 records representing 104 species of freshwater fish collected from over 5000 locations across Canada between 1967 and 2010. Analysis of the 28 most frequently occurring species (>1000 records) showed that the majority of variation in Hg concentrations (when normalized to a standard size) was accounted for by geographic location. Median Hg concentrations increased with trophic level (r = 0.40, p < 0.05), with the highest Hg concentrations found in piscivorous species such as walleye (Sander vitreus), northern pike (Esox lucius), and lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush). The Canadian Fish Mercury Database provides the most comprehensive summary of fish Hg measurements in Canada, and the results indicate that several regionally observed trends in fish Hg concentrations (e.g., Hg biomagnification and geographic variation) are observed at a national scale. Implications for the effective assessment of changes in fish Hg concentrations in relation to changes in Hg emission regulations are discussed.

AB  - The Driftwood river and its tributaries are very productive asexemplified by the high quality spawning, rearing and resident habitat which is suitable for all of the fishes native to the Stuart drainage including sockeye. Lion and Kastburg creeks have exceptional potential for spawning and rearing below and above the barriers. Fish ladders on these streams would undoubtably be a worthwhile endeavour opening up many miles of first class habitat and consequently increasing salmonid production. Resident habitat appears good throughout the system, holdingareas, cover and pools are ubiquitous. Dolly Varden in the vicinity of 15-20 lbs are widely rumoured. Although we did not actually catch anyof that size we did see one or two while floating down the river which would approach 12 lbs.

Others were at such low flows that it lead to much speculation as to how productive were they during the spawning runs. In other words observations made were not necessarily congruent with conclusions in regard to fisheries potential albeit justification for speculation in this matter can be found in that the individuals doing the survey were quite familiar with this system including its fluctuations and relative productivity.

AB  - During June and July, 1974, a survey of the streams flowing into the south arm of Takla Lake and Middle River was undertaken. The purpose of the survey was to conduct a basic inventory to determine the species of fish found in these streams and their relative abundance. The overall productivity of the streams was estimated by the fish present, and the potential productivity. The potential productivity is a subjective evaluation based on physical characteristics of the stream such as water temperature, abundance of suitable spawning gravel and rearing habitat, and lack of physical barriers. Some information on Sockeye and Kokanee spawning in the area was obtained from the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (I.P.S.F.C.). There is a data table in the appendix summarizing the I.P.S.F.C. data on numbers of Sockeye spawning. This report begins with some general descriptions of existing developments in the area, soils, topography, physical characteristics of the streams, species, of fish found and relative productivity of the streams. Following the general descriptions, there is a detailed description of every stream surveyed. The last section will include recommendations for the protection of the important streams.

AB  - For certain populations of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka, spawner and recruit data are either absent or too limited to estimate escapement goals (target abundance of spawners). In some cases, scientists instead use data on productivity of nursery lakes; however, many such analyses have not accounted for uncertainties. We therefore extended a previously developed lake productivity method for estimating escapement goals (the photosynthetic rate (PR) model) by using a Bayesian statistical approach that takes several sources of uncertainty into account. Utilizing data for Fraser River, British Columbia, sockeye salmon stocks, we compared this Bayesian PR method with stock–recruitment analysis. In six of seven cases, probability distributions of spawner abundance goals from the Bayesian PR method were 27% narrower on average than those from the stock–recruitment method. In four of seven cases, the Bayesian PR method produced higher median estimates of target spawner abundance than did stock–recruitment analysis; the other three pairs of estimates were within 7% of one another. We suggest that the Bayesian PR method is a potential alternative to using stock–recruitment data to estimate escapement goals for sockeye salmon populations.

AB  - Suspended sediment characteristics were analysed in three watersheds of the Takla Lake region. The hydrology of the area is dominated by a snowmelt peak followed by summer and fall low flows during which salmon spawning occurs. Snowmelt and spawning contribute to the high variability in sediment concentrations. The highest suspended sediment concentrations in 1992 and 1993, from 53 mg/L in Forfar Creek to 122 mg/L in O'Ne-eil Creek, occurred during the June snowmelt peak. Spawning salmon appear to have caused a secondary peak in suspended sediment concentration in 1992 during the summer flow. Sediment concentrations in 1993 were confounded by a series of summer storm flows. High concentration variability due to hydrologic and biologic controls and limited data restrict an accurate assessment of suspended sediment yield.

AB  - Results of a fall limnological survey of 19 lakes in the Fraser River system are presented. Lakes were grouped into broad biogeoclimatic zones and zonal averages of selected limnological variables were used as "production indices" to facilitate comparisons among zones, and with other BC coastal and Yukon River Basin lakes. The most productive lakes of the Fraser system were in the Interior Plateau Zone (Zone A), followed by lakes in the Columbia Mountain Zone (Zone B), which in turn were more productive than lakes of the Coast and Insular Mountain Zone (Zone C). Values of "production indices" for Fraser Zone C lakes were very similar to average index values from coastal lakes situated along the entire 1200 km coastline of BC, suggesting a common influence of climatic and edaphic factors throughout this extensive zone. A South to North trend toward increasing lake "productivity indices" values was apparent when "interior" Fraser lakes (Zones A and B) were compared with interior Yukon River Basin lakes. We consider this marked latitudinal trend to be related to regional differences in climatic and edaphic factors which influence supply, retention and concentration of nutrients in lakes. Several Fraser River lakes were identified and ranked as potential candidates for lake fertilization to enhance sockeye salmon production.

There has been no flow in this area in two of the last five years (Fielden 1995, ARL 1999) so there was some suggestion that the fish were strays from another regularly spawning population. Outlet spawning kokanee populations are not common, but kokanee spawning has not been reported in any of the tributaries to Burns Lake (Weber and Tupniak 1981, ARL 1999).

AB  - A fall juvenile salmonid hydroacoustic survey was implemented at Stuart and Trembleur Lake in 2017. Hydroacoustic data was collected using a BioSonics DT-X split beam echo sounder with a 200 kHz transducer. The lake surveys replicated previous DFO surveys with our 2017 results outlined in this report. Fall nerka fry from Stuart and Trembleur Lake were captured using a mid-water trawl to determine their size and age composition. Stuart Lake trawling in 2017 resulted in the capture of 281 nerka fry. Juvenile trawl catches were composed of 87% age-0, and 2% age-1 nerka. The remaining catch included sculpin (31), whitefish (3), and burbot (1). Mean length and weight of age-0 fry was 73 mm and 4.4 g, while age-1 fry was 172 mm and 61.8 g, respectively. The highest densities of fish were captured within Region 1 (Westerly area). Trembleur Lake trawling in 2017 resulted in the capture of 479 nerka fry. Juvenile trawl catches were composed of 90% age-0, and 9% age-1 nerka. The remaining catch included whitefish (4). Mean length and weight of age-0 fry was 81 mm and 6.0 g, while age-1 fry was 172 mm and 58.1 g, respectively. The highest densities of fish were captured in Region 2 (Central area). The Stuart Lake hydroacoustic densities were clustered near the westerly area of the lake. Tracked densities of the total fish population were highest from 5 m to 35 m, and mean tracked densities ranged from 130 fish / ha to 662 fish /ha. A limnetic population estimate of 5,140,953 for 2017 was determined from echo counting. Corresponding population estimates for “small” classed nerka of 1,592,987 (47 fish/ha) was determined to be a ‘conservative’ estimate due to unsteady field collection-lake conditions. The Trembleur Lake hydroacoustic densities were clustered near the southwestern and central area of the lake. Tracked densities of the total fish population were highest from 10 m to 32 m, and mean tracked densities ranged from 178 fish / ha to 1,447 fish /ha. A limnetic population estimate of 5,082,770 for 2017 was determined from echo counting. Corresponding population estimates for “small” classed nerka of 2,103,056 (212 fish/ha) was determined to be ‘robust’ due to steady field collection-lake conditions. A sensitivity analysis comparing echo counting and echo integration techniques showed consistent covariation of fish targets per hectare for both Stuart and Trembleur Lake. Noise scatter and instability of the tow body from the lake surface state at Stuart Lake rendered our interpretation of data to be of lower quality when compared to the Trembleur data. Three methods of analysis and processing were compared, of which echo counting techniques using 2 m depth bins, horizontally stratified at 250 m intervals, provided a median estimate; thus considered the final population estimator for both lakes in 2017. Low escapement and low fry recruitment may be limiting nerka production from Stuart and Trembleur lakes. Recommendations for additional monitoring and associated activities are provided.

TY  - report
AU  - R.S. Cope
AU  - J.S. MacDonald
AB  - Before impacts of forest harvesting on Pacific salmon populations can be fully understood, the natural physical and biological influences on incubation processes must be understood within interior British Columbia watersheds. The study objective was to estimate overwinter survival of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerku) embryos within various redd micro-environments. Egg to pre-emergent fry bioassays, in conjunction with microhabitat environmental monitoring, were implemented to define a range of natural spawning conditions and their relative contribution to fry recruitment. Four adjacent tributaries (Kynoch, Forfar, Gluskie, and Bivouac creeks) of the Stuart-Takla watershed were studied during the 1993 and 1994 broodyears. Sockeye salmon successfully spawned over a wide range of habitats. Survival rates between habitat types were not significantly different in contrast to predictions generated from optimum models. This was due to the definition of marginal habitat. Spawning adults avoided truly marginal areas with intragravel dissolved oxygen levels below 3.0 mg/L. As a result, in situ redd simulations showed similar intragravel conditions in both low utilization (assumed marginal) and high utilization (assumed preferred) spawning areas. Physical (i.e., hydraulic regime, bedload characteristics) and biological (i.e., mass cleaning by high densities of spawning adults) processes result in uniformly high quality gravel conditions with permeabilities, surface water interchange, and intragravel dissolved oxygen levels associated with high incubation success. Riparian-zone substrates in the study streams were characterized by large amounts of lacustrine deposits. Reduced escapement levels, or sediment inputs which exceed current bedload transport, may impact incubation environment. By spawning early in the season (July-August), the early Stuart sockeye salmon stock enjoy advanced embryological development prior to the onset of low water temperatures. Embryos rapidly accumulate the thermal units necessary to hatch, thereby becoming- mobile in time to avoid freezing and desiccation as water-levels decline and reach seasonal minima. Embryos and alevins of the early Stuart stock can apparently tolerate temperature conditions previously considered lethal, and emerge successfully in the spring after accumulating less thermal units than any other Fraser River stock. These mechanisms, are closely linked to the stream thermal regime. Riparian forestry prescriptions must be closely monitored to detect and quantify any stream temperature changes that may impact the developmental timing of incubating salmonids.

AB  - In 1990, adult chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) carcasses were recovered from the Nechako and Stuart Rivers. The purpose of this work was to collect biological data on size, sex, age, life history, egg retention and fecundity of chinook in these rivers. This information will contribute to the database being compiled under the auspices of the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program (NFCP) Technical Committee to assess achievement of the conservation goal. A brief comparison to data from previous years is also presented. Four hundred and forty-four carcasses were collected on the Nechako River between September 13 and 30,1990. Approximately ten percent of these were rejected due to the advanced state of decomposition, resulting in a total of 400 carcasses being sampled. On the Stuart River, 2208 carcasses were collected and 548 were sampled for age analysis. Nechako River chinook carcasses recovered in 1990 exhibit similar biological characteristics to those collected from 1980 to 1989. Mean postorbital-hypural length (70.8 cm) is approximately the same as mean length observed (72.1 cm) in the brood year (1985). The dominant age class (5) was the same as in all previous years except 1984. Comparable data for the Stuart River are available for 1980 and 1989. The dominant age class was 5 for all years. Mean length of fish sampled in 1990 (72.2 cm) was similar to previous years.

Area under the curve (AUC) methodology was applied to the Nechako River escapement data and yielded an estimated escapement of 1,144 chinook. In the Stuart River, an index of spawning escapement was obtained by adult tagging and subsequent carcass recovery. A total of 176 adult chinook were tagged with a subsequent recovery of 664 chinook carcasses from the main spawning areas in the upper reaches of the Stuart River. The population estimate of the Stuart River was 2,420 chinook.

Not only is this a most unusual population because of its time of spawning, but it is the only kokanee population sampled which is undoubtedly reared in Francois Lake. Examination of the growth characteristics and scale patterns of these fish may contribute to an understanding of those kokanee which spawn in Stellako River. A wide variety of sizes and scale patterns are found in the Stellako River spawning population. Any information which can be used to determine whether these fish originate in Francois or Fraser Lakes is most valuable.

TY  - report
AU  - Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd.
AB  - Finger-Tatuk Provincial Park was created in 1999 following recommendations in the Vanderhoof Land and Resource Management Plan. One of the management goals of the park is the maintenance of fish stocks in the upper Chilako River Watershed, particularly the regionally significant populations of kokanee and rainbow trout. Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd. has previously prepared a biodiversity monitoring plan framework for the park, which recommended monitoring the kokanee population within Finger Creek, since the size, status, and biology of this population within the park remains largely unknown. Triton was retained by the British Columbia Ministry of Water, Land, and Air Protection (WLAP) to conduct a habitat assessment and spawner enumeration of kokanee on Finger Creek between Finger Lake and Tatuk Lake. In addition to the spawner enumerations and habitat assessment, length and gonad retention data, and otolith samples were collected and have been submitted with this report to WLAP for ageing.

AB  - There is no question that the forest industry is of primary economic importance to the Province of British Columbia and that the continued profitable exploitation of forest resources is essential as a means of support for the majority of our citizens. It is reasonal to expect that, in the course of exploiting our forest resources, some damage to resources of lesser importance should be sustained. However, to the Province as a whole, such damage or costs to other resources are economically justifiable only to the extent that the resulting benefits to the forest industry exceed the costs borne by the secondary resources.

TY  - report
AU  - Triton Environmental Consultants Ltd.
SN  - M90-3
AB  - An Early Warning Monitoring Program was developed by the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program (NFCP) in 1989 to provide a framework to identify changes in the chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) stock prior to the eventual return of spawners. The objective of the juvenile outmigration project is to develop an index based on an estimate of the size and timing of the chinook population that migrates from rearing habitats of the upper Nechako River. In 1990, a combination of index sampling (seining and electrofishing) and trapping was performed. The seining and electrofishing conducted throughout Reaches 1 to 4, were initiated due to forced releases experienced in April which precluded the use of a partial fixed 'W' fence during this period. The 1990 index, derived from trapping, of the estimated abundance of chinook fry migrating from the upper Nechako River during late spring and early summer was an order of magnitude less than that estimated for the same time period in 1989. This suggests that the forced releases may have been responsible for a premature migration of chinook in the early spring of 1990. The Rotary Screw Trap (RST), tested this season, captured chinook similar in size to those captured at the 'W' fence as well as larger two year old coarse fish species and adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). In addition, the rotary screw trap captured a greater number of chinook than the 'W' fence per volume of river discharge sampled.

AB  - In 1991, the size, distribution and abundance of juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) was measured in the upper 100 km of the Nechako River, as part of the third year of the Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program. Average date of 50% emergence of juveniles, as estimated from their growth in length and weight, ranged from April 30 to May 20. Electroshocking and seining surveys showed that the centre of distribution of chinook (0+) moved upstream from April to July and then moved downstream in the fall and early winter. Maximum density of electroshocked chinook (0+) occurred in mid-May and then decreased exponentially over May to November at a rate of 0.72%d-1 for day catches and 1.3%d-1 for night catches. Maximum density of seined fish also occurred in mid-May and decreased at a rate of 1.1%d-l for day catches and 1.2%d-1 for night catches. Maximum density of fish captured by rotary screw traps peaked in mid-May and then decreased at an instantaneous rate of 22%d-l. A total of 21,423 chinook (0+) were captured by the rotary screw traps, which, when expanded by the proportion of river volume sampled by the traps, was equivalent to a downstream migration index of 105,702 chinook (0+).

Water temperatures were managed by regulating Skins Lake Spillway releases to control flows in the Nechako River below Cheslatta Falls and at Vanderhoof. In 2008, mean daily water temperatures in the Nechako River above the Stuart River confluence did not exceed 20.0°C (68.0°F) between July 20 and August 20. Over the duration of the 2008 Summer Water Temperature and Flow Management Project (July 10 to August 20), the total volume of water released was 7,529.3 m³/s-d, (265,897 cfs-d), and the average release during the Project was 179.3 m³/s (6,330.9 cfs).

AB  - The health of the Nechako watershed is critical to the long-term social, economic, environmental and cultural well being of all its residents. Yet, this system faces a number of significant challenges. The changing climate has contributed to the mountain pine beetle epidemic and other adverse impacts; the iconic Nechako White Sturgeon have become an endangered species; creeks and streams throughout the watershed have degraded; and the diversion of water out of the Nechako River system continues to impact many aspects of watershed health. Many projects and initiatives are underway to address these issues; however, there is a need for improved coordination and more effective sharing of knowledge and other resources. The Nechako Watershed Roundtable (NWR) was established in 2015 to address this need for collaboration and to develop a strategy to further advance the vision of a healthy Nechako. This report represents the first version of the Nechako Watershed Strategy. It builds on the findings of a Nechako Watershed Health Report and online atlas – completed in 2015 - which compiled and analyzed available information to characterize the state of the watershed. The Strategy process added to these findings by engaging communities and technical advisors to discuss the issues and concerns they were observing and to propose actions to address those concerns.

This higher level of stewardship can only be achieved through the principle of integrated resource management, wherein all resource values, as well as social, economic, and environmental needs, are indentified and considered. Resource planning will reflect social values and incorporate clear commitments to conserve biological diversity, maintain the inherent productivity of aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and meet the needs of an econmically viable and sustainable industry...

AB  - The people of the Cheslatta Carrier Nation lived for centuries on the shores of Cheslatta and Murray Lakes. They enjoyed a peaceful, self-sustaining existence. They hunted the moose, bear, deer and other game. They used the meat for food and the furs kept them warm in the long winters. The Cheslatta people had extensive traplines running from Uncha Lake to Tahtsa Lake and as far south as the Ulkatcho territory. The catch from these bountiful trapelines provided them with barter at areaa trading posts, as well as providing food and clothing. The land also produced a large variety of berries and plants that the people harvested each season. Medicinal plants, herbs, and roots were gathered and utilized as ancient and effective medicines. The waters of the Cheslatta, Murray, Ootsa. and many other area lakes provided the people with an endless supply of trout, char, kokanee, whitefish, and ling cod many of which were dried and smoked and stored for the winter. The Nechako River provided an important source of sockeye and Chinook salmon.
