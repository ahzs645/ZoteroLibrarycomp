AB  - Analysis of data from four sockeye rearing lakes of the Fraser River system for periods of up to 20 yr provided information on the relation of estimated fish density (female spawners/ha), temperature, and zooplankton standing crops to growth. The lakes differed widely in all attributes. Growth was inversely related to estimated population density in three of the lakes, but wide variations in growth at low density occurred in the fourth, a cold lake at high elevation with short growing season. In this lake, and to a lesser extent in another lake with short growing season, temperature during fry emergence and early lake residence accounted for much of the recorded fluctuation in growth. Reduced zooplankton abundance was associated with high sockeye density in two of the lakes with intermediate standing crops and greatest sockeye densities, but was not recorded in a lake of low standing crop and intermediate sockeye density. Sockeye feeding was found to be highly selective in one lake, and a limited proporti...,

AB  - Researchers have cautioned against the borrowing of consumption and growth parameters from other species and life stages in bioenergetics growth models. In particular, the function that dictates temperature dependence in maximum consumption (C-max) within the Wisconsin bioenergetics model for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha produces estimates that are lower than those measured in published laboratory feeding trials. We used published and unpublished data from laboratory feeding trials with subyearling Chinook Salmon from three stocks (Snake, Nechako, and Big Qualicum rivers) to estimate and adjust the model parameters for temperature dependence in C-max. The data included growth measures in fish ranging from 1.5 to 7.2 g that were held at temperatures from 14 degrees C to 26 degrees C. Parameters for temperature dependence in C-max were estimated based on relative differences in food consumption, and bootstrapping techniques were then used to estimate the error about the parameters. We found that at temperatures between 17 degrees C and 25 degrees C, the current parameter values did not match the observed data, indicating that C-max should be shifted by about 4 degrees C relative to the current implementation under the bioenergetics model. We conclude that the adjusted parameters for C-max should produce more accurate predictions from the bioenergetics model for subyearling Chinook Salmon.

AB  - Since the early 1980s, a water temperature management program has been in existence on the Nechako River system in central British Columbia, Canada. The program releases water based on anticipated meteorological conditions in an attempt to prevent temperature from exceeding a specified threshold of 20◦C downstream during a period when spawning migrations of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka are in the Nechako River. Since the inception of the program, this threshold has been exceeded only rarely; however, the variables that influence water temperature and that are used to manage water releases in the Nechako River watershed have not been subject to an independent analysis. Increasing demand for water at other times of year and a desire to restore a more natural hydrograph to the river to meet other ecological demands have impelled this analysis. A principal components analysis that examined the factors contributing to river temperature demonstrated that the summer controlled flow releases accounted for 24% of the temperature variability and were probably a factor in maintaining compliance with the program’s temperature threshold. Furthermore, during most summers, the Nechako River provided a cooling influence to input from the Stuart River tributary in a downstream reach that is used by the majority of the migrating sockeye salmon. Water temperature has a modest influence on prespawning mortality (up to 22% of the variability), suggesting that attempts to reduce summer water temperatures through releases in the upper Nechako River watershed can mitigate against poor spawning success of sockeye salmon populations that migrate through the lower reaches of the system.

AB  - Anaerobic digestion is a well established technology for the reduction of organic matter and stabilization of wastewater. Biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, is produced as a useful by-product of the process. Current solid waste management at the city of Prince George is focused on disposal of waste and not on energy recovery. Co-digestion of fresh fruit and vegetable waste with sewer sludge can improve biogas yield by increasing the load of biodegradable material. A six week full-scale project co-digesting almost 15,000 kg of supermarket waste was completed. Average daily biogas production was found to be significantly higher than in previous years. Digester operation remained stable over the course of the study as indicated by the consistently low volatile acids-to-alkalinity ratio. Undigested organic material was visible in centrifuged sludge suggesting that the waste should have been added to the primary digester to prevent short circuiting and to increase the hydraulic retention time of the freshly added waste.

AB  - Population viability has often been assessed by census of reproducing adults. Recently this method has been called into question and estimation of the effective population size (Ne) proposed as a complementary method to determine population health. We examined genetic diversity in five populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Fraser River watershed (British Columbia, Canada) at 11 microsatellite loci over 20 years using DNA extracted from archived scale samples. We tested for changes in genetic diversity, calculated the ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size to give the statistic M, calculated Ne from the temporal change in allele frequency, used the maximum likelihood method to calculate effective population size (NeM), calculated the harmonic mean of population size, and compared these statistics to annual census estimates. Over the last two decades population size has increased in all five populations of chinook examined; however, Ne calculated for each population was low (81–691) and decreasing over the time interval measured. Values of NeM were low, but substantially higher than Ne calculated using the temporal method. The calculated values for M were generally low (M < 0.70), indicating recent population reductions for all five populations. Large-scale historic barriers to migration and development activities do not appear to account for the low values of Ne; however, available spawning area is positively correlated with Ne. Both Ne and M estimates indicate that these populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding effects and may lack the ability to respond adaptively to stochastic events. Our findings question the practice of relying exclusively on census estimates for interpreting population health and show the importance of determining genetic diversity within populations.

AB  - This article examines the conflicting subjectivities and space-times of Indigenous and colonial law that underpin the recent shutdown of the Canadian economy as people barricaded railways and ports in solidarity with the Witsuwit'en hereditary chiefs' blockade against the Coastal GasLink pipeline across their territory. The article argues that this conflict between Canadian and Witsuwit'en law reflects fundamental tensions between their respective foundations in relations of the commodity and the gift. Within settler capitalist society, the value of a commodity is constructed relationally through a political economy of exchange that aims to speed transactions to maximize profits. With an ongoing drive for time-space compression, there is continual pressure in settler capitalism to develop new infrastructure that can speed the circulation of commodities. In Witsuwit'en society, the gift presents a contrasting logic of place-time extension. Rather than focusing on closing transactions to increase profits, gift giving stretches reciprocal obligations into the past and future. Contrasting these distinct conceptions of the relationship between value and time, the article argues that the Witsuwit'en struggle with Coastal GasLink should be understood as conflict between colonial temporal enclosures and a radical promise to open futures different to those engendered by the colonial present.

AB  - Research around the world has been nearly unanimous about the positive impacts of Indigenous-led health organizations on Indigenous peoples' qualitative experiences in health care, in the face of often negative experiences in non-Indigenous-led health care settings. Urban environments, including health care environments, are areas of increasing attention with regard to Indigenous peoples' health in Canada. In this study, which took place in the northern city of Prince George, British Columbia, 65 Indigenous community members and health services workers participated in interviews and focus groups, describing their experiences with urban Indigenous-led health organizations-defined in this study as non-governmental organizations that prioritize the values and practices of local Indigenous communities. Employing perspectives on place and relationships drawn from Indigenous critical theory and Indigenous community resurgence to analyze the findings of this qualitative study leads to a focus on how relationships impact and can even constitute places, enabling new understandings of the roles of Indigenous-led health organizations in urban Indigenous community resurgence.

AB  - This paper explores how remixed methodologies can inform research in Indigenous communities using short films, combining archival and contemporary footage. Drawing on the lineages of Indigenous and feminist community-based research methodologies, we develop a three-part conception of remixed methodologies. We emphasize, first, the need to resituate the process of knowledge production within relationships between researchers and Indigenous community members. Second, we stress the importance of reconsidering the intended outputs of community-university collaboration to centre community goals. Third, we underscore how remixed methodologies can disrupt the narratives surrounding settler colonial archival resources, resituating historical footage with relation to contemporary Indigenous contexts. We apply this framework to our collaborative work with the Witsuwit'en Cultural and Language Authority and the Office of Aboriginal Education at British Columbia School District #54, combining archival and contemporary films to create Indigenous education resources. Specifically, we remixed footage of Witsuwit'en traditional activities from two 1927 National Museum of Canada films with contemporary interviews and footage of Witsuwit'en governance and land use activities. We highlight how making archival films relevant to contemporary Indigenous community goals required disrupting the conventions of scholarly authority, designing collaborative outputs to suit community aims, and resituating knowledge production within the context of Witsuwit'en resilience in the face of colonialism.

AB  - Academics and champions seeking to guide and implement proactive climate change adaptation must be aware of how local political factors can be a barrier or a benefit to action. With a wave of support, the City of Prince George, Canada, pursued adaptation initiatives for six years; however, part way through the project, political changes resulted in a local governmental shift in focus. Semi-structured interviews with local experts reflect on how political changes affected the nature and legacy of adaptation in Prince George. Respondents indicated that the new political regime was not anti-environmental but explicitly focused on reducing costs, which meant minimizing studies and providing essential services. Initiatives related to transportation infrastructure and land use planning continued to move forward, whereas issues related to flooding and ecosystems were stalled. Plans and strategies that make clear links to costs and actions, and where the public clearly understands how inactions will affect them, are more likely to move forward in a less supportive political environment. Redundancies in capacity are important to maintain institutional memory. Effective communication is essential for stakeholders to understand why local governments should invest in adaptation, and to potentially present adaptation as a positive unifying direction for a community.

AB  - Almost 1.7 million people in the settler colonial nation of Canada identify as Indigenous. Approximately 52 per cent of Indigenous peoples in Canada live in urban areas. In spite of high rates of urbanization, urban Indigenous peoples are overlooked in health care policy and services. Because of this, although health care services are more plentiful in cities as compared to rural areas, Indigenous people still report significant barriers to health care access in urban settings. This qualitative study, undertaken in Prince George, Canada, examines perceived barriers to health care access for urban Indigenous people in light of how colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples in their everyday lives. The three most frequently reported barriers to health care access on the part of the 65 participating health care providers and Indigenous clients of health care services are: substandard quality of care; long wait times; and experiences of racism and discrimination. These barriers, some of which are common complaints among the general population in Canada, are interpreted by Indigenous clients in unique ways rooted in experiences of discrimination and exclusion that stem from the settler colonial context of the nation. Through the lenses of cultural safety and ethical space frameworks developed by international Indigenous scholars in efforts to better understand and operationalize relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and societies in the context of settler colonialism this study offers an understanding of these barriers in light of the specific ways that colonialism intrudes into Indigenous clients' access to care on an everyday basis.

AB  - Pacific salmon encounter widely varying environmental conditions across populations. Performance traits and environmental tolerance limits are predicted to be related to the typical abiotic and biotic conditions encountered by each population. Endurance swim performance at three different temperatures (8, 12, 22 degrees C) was compared across nine populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792)) parr from British Columbia, Canada, reared in a common laboratory environment. In addition, relative ventricular mass (RVM) was compared between good and poor performers from each population. Populations significantly differed in endurance swim performance and these differences were related to the natal lake environment. Specifically, parr populations that reside in warm, shallow lakes (Okanagan, Scotch, and Stellako) had superior swim performance at 12 degrees C compared with 8 degrees C. All other populations from deeper, cooler lakes had equivalent swim performance at 8 and 12 degrees C. Individual variability in swim performance within a population was not due to differences in cardiac size. Similarly, RVM did not vary across parr populations, suggesting that population differences in swim performance were not associated with cardiac size. This study provides further support that sockeye salmon parr are locally adapted to their environmental conditions.

AB  - The paradox of food insecurity and food waste existing side by side in developed countries is also widely observed at institutions of higher education (IHEs) across North America. A collaborative faculty, staff, and student-run food waste audit at the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) was conducted for the 2 primary foodservice providers at its Prince George Campus in the spring of 2015. Food wastes totaled 1.1 tonnes/week. Food wastes collected in campus composting green bins made up 43% of currently compostable food wastes at UNBC and only 26% of both currently and potentially compostable food wastes.

AB  - This paper reflects on the methodological challenges of co-managed research as experienced from a non-Indigenous perspective. In 2003, Tl'azt'en Nation and the authors initiated a toponymy study that involved finding a curricular use for Dakelh place names. In this article, we chronicle our experiences with negotiating and managing this study with Tl'azt'en Nation. Some events are specific to the topic; others are characteristic of co-managed research in general. We offer insights into what it means as non-Indigenous researchers to enter discursive territory that is charged with emotion and cultural sensitivity, and also explore the often contentious issues that can arise in Indigenous research, particularly oral history, ethnohistorical interpretation, and cultural representation. The paper concludes by discussing the opportunities and challenges of co-managed research.

AB  - Anadromous salmon migrations are energetically expensive. Long-distance migrants should be efficient in their use of energy and minimize swimming costs wherever possible. We explore swimming strategies and energy-saving tactics employed by three long-distance-migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks in the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia. We used stereovideography and bank-side observations to estimate swimming speeds (from tailbeat frequency) and ground speeds (using distance traveled and duration) for individuals at several sites. Salmon were highly efficient at migration (i.e., ground speeds equaled or exceeded swimming speeds) through reaches with relatively low encountered currents (<0.25 m·s-1). We speculate that salmon exploit small reverse-flow vortices to achieve this feat. With low encountered currents, most salmon migrated according to an optimal swimming speed model: migrants minimized transport costs per unit distance traveled. Generally, salmon were less efficient at mig..., Les migrations anadromes des saumons coûtent cher en énergie. Les poissons qui migrent sur de longues distances doivent faire une utilisation efficace de l'énergie et minimiser chaque fois que c'est possible le coût de la nage. Nous avons examiné les stratégies de nage et les tactiques de conservation d'énergie chez trois populations de saumons rouges (Oncorhynchus nerka) qui migrent sur de longues distances dans le bassin du fleuve Fraser en Colombie-Britannique. À l'aide de vidéographie stéréoscopique et d'observations depuis la rive, il a été possible d'estimer la vitesse de nage (à partir de la fréquence de battement de la queue) et la vitesse au sol (au moyen de la distance parcourue et de la durée du trajet) pour des individus à plusieurs sites. Les saumons sont très efficaces dans leur migration (i.e., la vitesse au sol équivaut à la vitesse de nage ou la surpasse) dans les zones où les courants sont relativement faibles (<0,25 m·s-1).

AB  - The area-under-the-curve estimate of salmon escapement is computed from aerial counts of fish and estimates of the residence time of spawners. Imprecision in both of these factors leads to error in the final escapement estimate and, thus, affects its reliability as an index of escapement over time. The population of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Nechako River, British Columbia, was chosen for a case study, and this paper illustrates how simple simulation models can be used to explore the increases in precision about escapement estimates associated with increasing the frequency of aerial flights. Results show that confidence in escapement estimates for the Nechako River Chinook salmon population decreases as the frequency of survey flights decreases; results also show that this pattern is robust to the typically small annual differences in mean residence time in the Nechako River. Such models can help managers optimize the frequency of aerial flights by comparing the benefits of frequent flights (i.e., increased precision in escapement estimates) with the costs of those flights.

AB  - We compared the effect of uncertainty in dose‐response model form on health risk estimates to the effect of uncertainty and variability in exposure. We used three different dose‐response models to characterize neurological effects in children exposed in utero to methylmercury, and applied these models to calculate risks to a native population exposed to potentially contaminated fish from a reservoir in British Columbia. Uncertainty in model form was explicitly incorporated into the risk estimates. The selection of dose‐response model strongly influenced both mean risk estimates and distributions of risk, and had a much greater impact than altering exposure distributions. We conclude that incorporating uncertainty in dose‐response model form is at least as important as accounting for variability and uncertainty in exposure parameters in probabilistic risk assessment.

AB  - We combined dose-response analyses with a probabilistic exposure assessment to estimate the risks to native Canadians who ingest methylmercury via fish consumption from natural lakes and a reservoir in British Columbia. Available dose-response data included multivariate measurements of central nervous system functioning in Iraqi children exposed to methylmercury prenatally. We applied the method of principal components to simplify the data structure. The first principal component described close to 80% of the variability in the data, making it a reasonable choice as an index. The relationship between mercury in maternal hair and the probability of an abnormal neurological effects index was modeled with the logistic and Weibull functions. The goodness-of-fit of the two models is discussed and the results compared to other published dose-response analyses. Exposure distributions were developed to represent methylmercury dose by using observed data on methylmercury contamination in the lakes and reservoir and reasonable assumptions about other key parameters such as fish consumption. We estimated risks to the target population using Monte Carlo simulation. Consumption of reasonable quantities of fish from these bodies of water does not pose a significant risk to the aboriginal population.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δD) in the tissues of animals often correlate with δD of local precipitation. Here we examined the relationship between δD in feathers and growing season precipitation for neotropical migrant songbirds breeding over a continent-wide isotopic gradient. δD values were determined on feathers of 140 individuals of 6 species of wild insectivorous forest songbirds (Setophaga ruticilla, Empidonax minimus, Vermivora peregrinus, Catharus ustulatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Hylocichla mustelina) taken from 14 breeding locations across North America. The δD of feathers was strongly correlated with the δD of growing season precipitation at breeding sites across North America. As feather hydrogen is metabolically inert after growth, this relationship was then used to assess the breeding origins of wintering migrants. Deuterium values of feathers from 64 individuals representing 5 species of migrants (Helmitheros vermivorus, Wilsonia citrina, Hylocichla mustelina, Dumetella carolinensis, Seirus aurocapillus) at a wintering site in Guatemala were consistent with those predicted from the known breeding ranges of these species. This study demonstrates hydrogen isotopes may become a powerful tool for linking breeding and wintering grounds of neotropical migrant songbirds, as well as other migratory species moving between isotopically distinct regions.

AB  - Several mammals have adapted to harsh winter conditions by adopting hibernation strategies that enable them to survive periods of unfavourable environmental conditions. At northern latitudes, black and brown bears can be in a state of hibernation for up to seven months. As a result of this prolonged occupation of one small space, bears can be vulnerable to environmental and human caused disturbances. In this study, we developed a predictive model that identifies potential den habitat for black bears that can assist with management planning for industrial land development activities. We identified 40 dens (17 excavated in soil and 23 natural rock cavities) and used fine-scale information to determine how dens were positioned in forest stands. We found that bears denned in areas on mid to upper slope positions and that soil dens were located mainly in clay-loam soil complexes while rock cavity dens were either caves or cavities in boulder piles. Den location was distant from portions of the study area with relatively high road density. We then used resource selection functions to predict where bear dens might be located on the landscape. When applied to the GIS data, the averaged coefficients suggested that 3.1% of the study area had a high suitability ranking as den habitat while 9.1%, 14.6%, and 73.2% had mid, low, and limited suitability, respectively. In our study area, habitat for den sites is reasonably predictable and should be considered during the planning of industrial activities.

AB  - The concept of industrial ecology is intrinsically appealing, but the practical sustainability of its precepts has yet to be adequately tested beyond the site-specific locations of most of its exemplars. Any environmental assessment must cover both sourcing and markets to establish whether initiatives to minimise mass and energy loss and promote symbiotic activities on-site are well-founded in coherent sustainable strategies for the relevant sectors off-site. The economics of industrial ecology is explored within this analytical framework, examining the interactions between the compositional and the technological elements of production that may combine to decouple environmental pollution from economic growth. Following a brief review of current industrial ecology exemplars in the forest industries sector, contrasting case studies of nascent dematerialisation of forest industries throughput are analysed. British Columbian First Nations' initiatives entailing communal eco-management systems within ancient temperate rainforests are compared with attempts to develop a modern Scottish forest industries cluster based on exotic softwood plantations. The findings emphasise the need for industrial ecology to extend its scope to embrace reform on broader resource management policies, as well as the promotion of site-based ecological technology, if it is to deliver the institutional reflexivity that can internalise both physical and economic environmental externalities.

AB  - Introduction. Disturbed by reports of high concentrations of cadmium in large land mammals in Arctic Canada, community members wondered if they should eat less moose (Alces alces). Study design. Risk assessment modelling. Methods. We measured cadmium concentrations in moose tissues donated by food hunters. As a conservative assumption, we took the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the means. Cadmium intake from other sources we estimated using risk assessment models. Assuming a Tolerable Daily Intake of cadmium of 1 microgram per kg body weight per day, we calculated maximum allowable intakes of moose kidney, liver and muscle. Results. For a non-smoking 70 kg adult, allowable monthly intakes are: 52 kg of moose muscle, or 137 g of kidney, or 516 g of liver. Allowable intakes varied by age and in proportion to body weight. Cigarette smokers (one to 1.5 packs per day) reach the limit even if they consume no moose at all. Conclusions. Adults may continue to eat moose kidney and liver occasionally and in moderate amounts, but children and cigarette smokers should not eat these organs at all. Consumption of moose muscle need not be restricted. Monitoring of cadmium concentrations in moose should continue.

AB  - Generic criteria and indicator (C&amp;I) frameworks have been the focus of recent work on sustainable forest management. These templates, however, may not be an appropriate approach for directing landscape-level forest management strategies. Instead, many argue that sustainable management should be determined using “bottom–up” approaches rather than standardized frameworks. This requires engaging local expertise in defining sustainability. Having a culturally distinct form of local knowledge, Aboriginal communities have an important role to play in decision-making processes. However, conventional participatory approaches, such as generic C&amp;I frameworks and multi-stakeholder planning processes, are often inappropriate for engaging Aboriginal involvement. We suggest that landscape-level forest planning should highlight rather than assimilate cultural perspectives on sustainable forest management. Using the co-managed John Prince Research Forest in central interior British Columbia as a case study, this paper presents the results of using C&amp;I and a scenario planning approach to describe an Aboriginal perspective of good forest stewardship. These results demonstrate that, in contrast with existing C&amp;I frameworks, locally-based sustainability criteria provide better guidance for developing and adapting landscape-level forest plans.

AB  - Conventional public library statistics are invaluable for management’s evaluation of library use and for benchmark comparisons. However, as the range and complexity of library services has grown, the number of performance measures has also proliferated. Since public library statistics cannot easily be combined into an overall measure of performance, researchers have proposed several global performance measures. Metrics such as The Library Quotient and HARPL Index have been received with varying degrees of acceptance. As public libraries compete for funding against other interests within the municipal environment, they require measures that are meaningful, pragmatic and that resonate with local decision makers. Existing metrics do not allow local government officials to easily compare the use of public libraries to other municipal facilities intended for public use or measure the impact of libraries on their users (Streatfield and Markless, 2006, p. 6). A novel approach to public library performance measurement was developed by college students during a volunteer project at the Prince George Public Library. Their time-based metric was further refined after a review of the literature and replicated as a case study research project in 2013. The latter study attempted to answer the following question: how many hours did the residents of Prince George use of the Bob Harkins branch and its collections during the month of August 2013?

AB  - This paper presents an application of the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to the Fraser River basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, over the latter half of the twentieth century. The Fraser River is the longest waterway in BC and supports the world’s most abundant Pacific Ocean salmon populations. Previous modeling and observational studies have demonstrated that the FRB is a snow-dominated system, but with climate change, it may evolve to a pluvial regime. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the changing contribution of snow to the hydrology of the FRB over the latter half of the twentieth century. To this end, a 0.25° atmospheric forcing dataset is used to drive the VIC model from 1949 to 2006 (water years) at a daily time step over a domain covering the entire FRB. A model evaluation is first conducted over 11 major subwatersheds of the FRB to quantitatively assess the spatial variations of snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff (R). The ratio of the spatially averaged maximum SWE to R (RSR) is used to quantify the contribution of snow to the runoff in the 11 subwatersheds of interest. From 1949 to 2006, RSR exhibits a significant decline in 9 of the 11 subwatersheds (with p < 0.05 according to the Mann–Kendall test statistics). To determine the sensitivity of RSR, the air temperature and precipitation in the forcing dataset are then perturbed. The ratio RSR decreases more significantly, especially during the 1990s and 2000s, when air temperatures have warmed considerably compared to the 1950s. On the other hand, increasing precipitation by a multiplicative factor of 1.1 causes RSR to decrease. As the climate continues to warm, ecological processes and human usage of natural resources in the FRB may be substantially affected by its transition from a snow to a hybrid (nival/pluvial) and even a rain-dominated system.

AB  - The Aboriginal Forest Planning Process (AFPP) was developed to integrate indigenous and western forest management approaches. The AFPP is a participatory decision-making tool designed to enhance co-management of the John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in central interior British Columbia, Canada and to elicit goals, objectives, criteria, and indicators of sustainable forest management from the JPRFs Aboriginal partners. Analysis of community interview transcripts, traditional land use documentation, and secondary sources resulted in a three-stage approach to information elicitation, management, and application. Resource and social values, concerns, and traditional knowledge are summarized and compiled according to criteria themes and sub-themes. This condensed information is further divided into spatial, quantitative, and qualitative criteria and indicator categories. The AFPP was a useful method for developing forest management goals, objectives and criteria; however, further interviews were required to identify appropriate management indicators.

AB  - Aboriginal tourism is increasingly seen as a strategy for economic diversification by many Aboriginal communities. While demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America has been demonstrated, little is known about visitor product preferences. This information is needed, however, by Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. Using a psychographic segmentation methodology, we surveyed visitors to northern British Columbia who expressed an interest in Aboriginal tourism to explore their interest in specific features of potential Aboriginal tourism products. Three distinct clusters were identified as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on each First Nation’s level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with tourists.

AB  - Rati fication of the Nisga&apos;a Final Agreement has had an inevitable effect on the conduct of negotiations for First Nations in the British Columbia treaty process. These effects include a general sense of encouragement set against British Columbia&apos;s historical denial of First Nation interests, direct support of negotiations, litigation and coping with special interest group resistance to aboriginal progress. This article examines these in fluences in the context of negotiations being conducted by the Lheidli T&apos;enneh First Nation in the Northern interior of British Columbia.

AB  - Biomass can be used for energy purposes by either combustion to heat and power or refining into solid and liquid biofuels. The majority of biomass is used for residential purposes in developing countries. Modern biomass use in industrialized countries is increasing, and more and more biomass is also traded to be used for energy purposes. The purpose of this paper is to locate the 15 largest ethanol, biodiesel, and wood pellet plants. Facilities generating heat, steam and electricity were left out. Secondly it is not generally known what share of biomass users are large plants. Also an effort is made to find out how much these large-scale biomass refining plants use imported feedstock. For the most part, very large industrial processing facilities are found in a small number of countries. The largest ethanol mills are found almost exclusively in the United States, with one very large plant in the Netherlands. The distribution of biodiesel and wood pellet plants is more dispersed. The countries with the most large biodiesel plants include the USA, Brazil, Spain, and the Netherlands. The countries with the most very large wood pellet plants include the USA, Canada, Russia, and Germany. Torrefaction and pyrolysis technologies are still rarely used on industrial scale. Ethanol and wood pellet plants tend to be sourced from local feedstocks, while biodiesel plants are much more likely to use imported feedstocks or a mix of imports and local biomass. All of these fuels are increasingly traded through the international market. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd

AB  - We examined sites used by 73 caribou located by radio-tracking during spring migration through a forested travel corridor. The physical and botanical characteristics of these sites were described to find what features (if any) distinguished them from the forest at large. Raised and open aspect, sparse tree cover, free-draining soils, and a simple flora with abundant lichens were features common to all the sites, but were lacking in the denser forest around. Scores for these attributes were ordinated by multidimensional scaling of similarities and differences from site to site. Separate searings for (i) terrain features, (ii) tree cover attributes, and (iii) floristic content each yielded a single cluster of points with few outliers and no particular pattern or trend. The inference is that the sites conformed to a single type with limited variation. A profile of the distinguishing characteristics was compiled and then applied to transects through the general migration area by persons unfamiliar with it beforehand. Sites which matched the profile proved easy to identify, even though they comprised only a small proportion of the area. Sites with high scores for the most distinctive attributes had more caribou at the time of radio-tracking.

AB  - Abstract Residents of northern British Columbia's resource-dependent areas have struggled to maintain the integrity of their communities as nonlocal firms exert ever-increasing influence over the region's resources and landscapes. Local leaders both construct and mobilize place as a vital part of their efforts to promote community well-being. This study focuses on the ways that the residents of three towns in the province's northern interior politicized place as a strategy for resisting the political influence and geographic designs of outsiders. The residents drew from their shared emotional response to powerlessness as a means of highlighting the inequities between insiders and outsiders, thereby generating a regional identity that calls into question the socioeconomic effects of resource industrialization in the north. In describing this dialectic between place making and economic restructuring, the article not only expands upon existing theory on place identity, but also contributes to a fuller understanding of the cultural geography of North America's resource-dependent communities.

AB  - In this introduction to the special issue, we explore how the experience of on-the-ground research in Indigenous geography transforms Native and non-Native practitioners by challenging, reworking, and ultimately expanding their existential, social, and conceptual understandings of place. Following a brief overview of contemporary work in the area of Indigenous geography, the essay unpacks this process of place-based metamorphosis with specific reference to the contributions that appear in the volume. As part of this discussion, we identify the epistemological, methodological, and ethical implications of candid and critical reflection on the relationship between place and experience in Indigenous approaches to geographic research.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins, Coleoptera: Curculionidae, Scolytinae) is a native insect of the pine forests of western North America, and its populations periodically erupt into large-scale outbreaks. During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000–2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m-2 yr-1 on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959–1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.

AB  - Recent research on the Aboriginal tourism market has revolved predominantly around establishing a profile of the traveller interested in Aboriginal tourism (hereafter referred to as the Aboriginal tourism traveller). Currently, the Aboriginal tourism traveller is generally described as a mature individual who is interested in having authentic experiences of different cultures. However, there is a need for a better understanding of what specific products this particular traveller is interested in, and in what style, format or nature of delivery. The study presented in this article attempts to provide insight into this topic. In a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, a questionnaire containing four potential Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products was administered to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. Despite a primary interest in nature experiences by the majority of visitors, one-third of our sample demonstrated considerable interest in experiences of Aboriginal culture. Results suggest the need for marketing diverse Aboriginal tourism attractions to attract repeat visitors and for offering an introductory experience to Aboriginal culture for first-time visitors.

AB  - British Columbia (BC) forests are estimated to have become a net carbon source in recent years due to tree death and decay caused primarily by mountain pine beetle (MPB) and related post-harvest slash burning practices. BC forest biomass has also become a major source of wood pellets, exported primarily for bioenergy to Europe, although the sustainability and net carbon emissions of forest bioenergy in general are the subject of current debate. We simulated the temporal carbon balance of BC wood pellets against different reference scenarios for forests affected by MPB in the interior BC timber harvesting area using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). We evaluated the carbon dynamics for different insect-mortality levels, at the stand- and landscape level, taking into account carbon storage in the ecosystem, wood products and fossil fuel displacement. Our results indicate that current harvesting practices, in which slash is burnt and only sawdust used for pellet production, require between 20–25 years for beetle-impacted pine and 37–39 years for spruce-dominated systems to reach pre-harvest carbon levels (i.e. break-even) at the stand-level. Using pellets made from logging slash to replace coal creates immediate net carbon benefits to the atmosphere of 17–21 tonnes C ha−1, shortening these break-even times by 9–20 years and resulting in an instant carbon break-even level on stands most severely impacted by the beetle. Harvesting pine dominated sites for timber while using slash for bioenergy was also found to be more carbon beneficial than a protection reference scenario on both stand- and landscape level. However, harvesting stands exclusively for bioenergy resulted in a net carbon source unless the system contained a high proportion of dead trees (>85%). Systems with higher proportions of living trees provide a greater climate change mitigation if used for long lived wood products.

AB  - In this essay I look at environmental impact assessment as it concerns major projects influencing aquatic environments in Canada. Environmental impact assessment is a process aimed at guarding the public interest in the proper use of resources in the aggregate. Compromises are usually worked out on a local basis for each project. More widely conceived trade-offs are favored by all but practised by few. All projects go through various stages, all begin as vague schemes; some crystallize as firm proposals and then go through the assessment process to construction and a subsequent period of operation. Environmental impact assessment as a process should reflect this pattern of activity rather than being just the preparation of statements about projects that are imminent. I have given particular emphasis to the need for follow up on whether what occurred was what was predicted. Also I have stressed the importance of anticipating that some impacts will not be foreseen and, therefore, the necessity for making ap..., La présente étude porte sur l'évaluation des effets environnementaux dans le cadre de grands projets ayant une incidence sur les milieux aquatiques au Canada. L'évaluation des effets environnementaux vise la protection de l'intérêt du public pour ce qui est de l'utilisation rationnelle des ressources.

AB  - The estimation of flow quantiles and the regionalization of hydrologic characteristics are two major foci of current hydrologic research. A flow-duration curve represents the annual flow-frequency characteristics of rivers by depicting the cumulative frequencies for average ranked flows in a river. Generally the process requires the empirical estimation of the mean flow at each of 365 ranks. A model requiring only five parameters is developed by combining the principles of order statistics and traditional flow-frequency analyses and is applied to flow-duration curves for rivers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Results from the model may be interpreted both statistically and physically and allow the identification of hydrologically similar regions. Streamflows in British Columbia are generated from a number of distinct physical processes operating in highly diverse environments. The mixture of the streamflow-generating processes requires that the statistical model be capable of encompassing the different flow-frequency regimes. Identification of hydrologic regions also depends on the inclusion of these generating processes. The model presented incorporates the physical generating processes of streamflow in both the statistical representation of flow-duration curves and their interpretation. Similarly, the spatial model presents hydrologic regions that correspond to the known physical environment.

AB  - The paper deals with the electrical aspects of the NechakoÂ¿KemanoÂ¿Kitimat hydro-electric power development and the associated aluminium-reduction works in the province of British Columbia, Canada. After briefly presenting the physiographic setting and civil-engineering features of the world's largest underground power development, with an ultimate installed capacity of 2,240,000 h.p., the paper discusses the outstanding features of many elements of the power development wherein new engineering ground has been broken. The unusually heavy electrical loading of the 300-kV transmission system is treated at some length, as well as the mechanical loading. In addition, the plant power-supply features of what will ultimately be the largest aluminium-reduction works in the world, at Kitimat, are discussed. The paper presents comparative data on the characteristics of such equipment as the impulse turbines, generators, main step-up and step-down transformer banks, and 300-kV power cables, derived from the tenders of the several manufacturers supplying the equipment.

AB  - Contemporary Indigenous activism asserts an agency for place not normally found in geographical scholarship. Through place-based protest, organizing, and direct action, Native and non-Native people are interacting with place as a conscious being with the capacity to speak, create, and teach the responsibilities required for more inclusive forms of coexistence in today’s settler states. This “placework” articulates a more-than-human geographical self whose subjectivities are grounded in, and accountable to, land-based relationships and knowledges. Placework contributes to a geographical posthumanism that offers a distinctively Indigenous approach to the predicaments of the Anthropocene.

AB  - Although the importance of aboriginal knowledge, values and perspectives in sustainable development has been recognised for many decades, worldwide examples exist showing that aboriginal involvement is less then effective. How and where to include aboriginal needs and goals has however been problematic. Ultimately, aboriginal forest values need to be considered with scientific strategies and their role and compatibility with forest conditions needs to be explored. Criteria and indicator (C&amp;I) frameworks can be used as a platform to include community needs and goals in management decisions. This review compares aboriginal forest ecological perspectives defined by Canadian local level C&amp;I frameworks with non-aboriginal local level C&amp;I frameworks to identify their differences at the indicator level. Three major themes mark the differences between aboriginal and non-aboriginal indicators: (1) aboriginal frameworks introduce ecological indicators of cultural importance; (2) there is an aesthetic concern for forest operations especially if they affect cultural owners; and (3) indicators regarding the access to resources are more complex and include the sustainability of the productivity, proximity, integrity and quality of resources used in traditional activities. Results show that First Nation forest sustainability issues are in effect a combination of forest conditions and values. Inclusion of forest values in C&amp;I frameworks is necessary because: (1) aboriginal communities do not dissociate culture from the environment and thus forest values from forest condition, (2) they have an impact on resulting forest management strategies and decisions, and (3) they offer a holistic approach to sustainability issues and a better picture of local environmental contexts.

AB  - Canadian research on contemporary erosion and sedimentation processes covers a wide range of scales, processes, approaches and environmental problems. This review of recent research focuses on the themes of sediment yield, land-use impact, fine-sediment transport, bed material transport and river morphology and numerical modelling of fluvial landscape development. Research on sediment yield and denudation has confirmed that Canadian rivers are often dominated by riparian sediment sources. Studies of the effects of forestry on erosion, in-stream sedimentation and habitat are prominent, including major field experimental studies in coastal and central British Columbia. Studies of fine-sediment transport mechanisms have focused on the composition of particles and the dynamics of flocculation. In fluvial dynamics there have been important contributions to problems of turbulence-scale flow structure and entrainment processes, and the characteristics of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. Although much of the work has been empirical and field-based, results of numerical modelling of denudational processes and landscape development also have begun to appear. The nature of research in Canada is driven by the progress of the science internationally, but also by the nature of the Canadian landscape, its history and resource exploitation. Yet knowledge of Canadian rivers is still limited, and problems of, for example, large pristine rivers or rivers in cold climates, remain unexplored. Research on larger scale issues of sediment transfer or the effects of hydrological change is now hampered by reductions in national monitoring programmes. This also will make it difficult to test theory and assess modelling results. Monitoring has been replaced by project- and issues-based research, which has yielded some valuable information on river system processes and opened opportunities for fluvial scientists. However, future contributions will depend on our ability to continue with fundamental fluvial science while fulfilling the management agenda. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Issues related to company-community relations and the social license to operate have emerged as strategic business issues. This paper aims to contribute to the growing body of research on long-term company-community relations. An analysis of the relationship between Alcan (Aluminum of Canada, Montréal, Canada part of Rio Tinto since 2007) with the Cheslatta Carrier First Nation in the Kemano-Kitimat area of northern British Columbia, Canada, provides three contributions. The first is related to the notion of relational legacy, which refers to the sedimentation of unresolved issues that have the potential to impede the realization of corporate activities and the reproduction of low levels of social license to operate. The second concerns stakeholder management. While the literature suggests that stakeholders should be managed by companies according to the degree of salience, this analysis suggests that researchers and managers should consider the evolution of the environmental context in their analyses. Third, the analysis suggests that small or marginalized groups, depicted by the stakeholder management literature as dormant stakeholders, should not be underestimated.

Various statistical techniques (K - nearest neighbour and cluster analyses based on Jaccard and percent dissimilarity matrices) were used to compare the parasite fauna in sockeye from the different lakes. K - nearest neighbour analysis demonstrated that considerable overlap existed among many of the studied lakes, whereas little overlap occurred among other lakes.

AB  - Specimens of Phyllodistomum umblae (Fabricius, 1780) from Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum) from the Nautley River, British Columbia, and Salmo gairdneri Richardson from the Stuart River, British Columbia, are described and figured using light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Particular emphasis is placed on describing the numbers, types, and arrangement of papillae as seen with scanning electron microscopy. No significant differences were observed between the present Canadian material from O. nerka and S. gairdneri and specimens of P. umblae described from Norway, Sweden, and the U.S.S.R. Thus, P. umblae has a holarctic distribution in salmonids. Phyllodistomum limnosa Sandeman and Pippy, 1967, described from Salmo salar L. and Salvelinus fontinalis (Mitchill) from Newfoundland, is regarded as a synonym of P. umblae. Phyllodistomum lachancei Choquztte, 1947, described from S. fontinalis in Quebec, probably is also a synonym of P. umblae, but a more detailed scanning electron microscope study of th...

AB  - In 1979, 1-0 container-grown and 2-0 bareroot lodgopole pine, Pinus contorta var latifolia (Engelm.), seedlings were planted on 20 winter landings using conventional and soil-auger planting techniques. Seedling survival and growth were assessed at the end of the first and fifth growing seasons and compared with the growth of naturally regenerated lodgepole pine seedlings on the adjacent cutover areas. Foliar nutrient content, soil bulk density, and soil nutrient pool were also compared between the two areas.Auger planting significantly improved early survival of bareroot stock but had no effect on initial survival rate of container-grown seedlings. The planting method had no significant effect on subsequent growth of either stock type. However, growth of seedlings that were planted on the landings was significantly poorer than that of natural regeneration on the adjacent cutovers. Higher soil density and a significantly reduced soil nutrient pool contributed one third and two thirds, respectively, to this observed growth reduction. Such results suggest that some form of site rehabilitation should be considered if planted trees are to reach their full growth potential on these landings.

AB  - Examination of 5,456 fish of 36 different species during 1951 and 1952 showed 4,925 or 90 per cent to be infected with at least one species of parasite. Records include fish from many lakes and streams of the Columbia and Fraser drainages and from a few localities in the Skeena, Peace, Liard and Skagit drainages. Parasites are recorded for each species of fish from each locality. The incidence of parasitism in the fish was comparable with that found by other surveys in eastern Canada and the United States. No major differences were found in the parasite faunas of the different river systems. Most of the common parasites were forms of circumpolar or general North American distribution. Several species of parasites described only from the Pacific coast area were common in certain hosts. Introduced species of fish showed very light infections with but few species of their normal parasites. The parasite fauna of fishes of this area appears to be less varied than in eastern and southern parts of the continent., non disponible

AB  - White sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836) larvae were reared at two temperatures (13.5 or 17.5°C) with or without gravel as a substrate to examine the effect of rearing environment on growth and whole body cortisol, an index of stress (initial weight 23.4 mg; four replicate tanks per treatment). Larvae were sampled 8, 16, and 24 days post-hatch. Larvae were larger when reared with substrate and at warmer temperatures. For whole body cortisol, a significant age by temperature interaction was observed with the highest values on day 16 for larvae from warm water treatments. Larvae reared in gravel consistently showed significantly lower whole body cortisol than larvae reared without substrate. In response to mechanical agitation, there was a significant effect of time following disturbance. Increased growth and reduced stress hormone levels make substrate rearing of yolksac larvae an important technique for enhancement efforts in artificial and natural environments. The positive effects of temperature on growth, however, with higher whole body cortisol, suggest that larval white sturgeon development may be better at cooler temperatures.

AB  - This paper presents a study describing the effect of various hydrological variables in stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) for solving the optimization problem of managing a hydropower system. We will show how choosing the best hydrological variables can strongly affect management policies. This is especially true for the system studied here, namely the Kemano hydroelectric system located in British Columbia, Canada, which is subject to large streamflow volumes due to significant snow cover during winter. Real-time snow water equivalent (SWE) data can be used directly as a variable in SDP management policies. Results indicate that for the system in this study, the maximum SWE (i.e., highest level of SWE observed from the start of winter to the current decision period) is the best among the methods investigated for effective, safe management, compared with Markov or order p autoregressive models when forecasts are not available., Cet article présente une étude décrivant l’effet de diverses variables hydrologiques de la programmation stochastique dynamique (SDP) pour résoudre le problème d’optimisation pour gérer un système hydroélectrique.

AB  - The Carrier First Nations, who are the original inhabitants of North Central British Columbia, have endured years of hardship as a result of European colonization. Over time, this has resulted in an erosion of traditional practices and a decline in overall health. There is concern that mental health practitioners are not meeting the needs of the Carrier people because they fail to understand the Carrier worldview. In an effort to better understand and respect the Carrier ideas and beliefs about mental health and mental illness, interviews were conducted with 7 traditional healers about their beliefs and their practices. The traditional healers reported that the concept of mental illness did not exist in pre-contact culture. However, the traditional healers who participated in this research actively practise ceremonies and rituals that seek to restore balance and harmony between the person and his or her environment.

AB  - Over the past several decades, a substantial amount of research has examined how cardiorespiratory physiology supports the diverse activities performed throughout the life cycle of Pacific salmon, genus Oncorhynchus. Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.

AB  - This paper considers a mathematical programming model for the management of a salmon fishery and watershed. Management objectives are specified as bounds and desirable target levels for certain important variables. The mathematical program consists of minimizing the deviation from these targets subject to natural and policy constraints. A detailed application studying the effect of the proposed Kemano II development project on the salmon fisheries of northwestern British Columbia is presented. Parametric programming is used to compare several development scenarios on the basis of the sensitivity of the system to reduce runoff in a specified year. Key words: mathematical models, fishery management, Pacific salmon, sensitivity analysis, experimentation, policy planning, Nous examinons dans le présent article un modèle de programmation mathématique applicable à la gestion d'une pêcherie de saumons et à l'aménagement de son bassin hydrographique. L'établissement de limites et de niveaux désirables pour certaines variables importantes est considéré comme un objectif spécifique de la gestion. Le programme mathématique consiste à réduire au minimum l'écart entre cibles et variables, compte tenu des contraintes naturelles et politiques. Nous présentons une application détaillée en étudiant les effets du projet Kemano II d'expansion des pêches de saumons dans le nordouest de la Colombie-Britannique. Nous servant d'une programmation paramétrique, nous comparons plusieurs scénarios d'expansion fondés sur la sensibilité du système à réduire le ruissellement en une année particulière.

AB  - The Intermontane Belt of the Canadian Cordillera has long been viewed as a passive, relatively rigid block between two metamorphic-plutonic belts, the Coast Plutonic Complex and the Omineca Belt. However, the Skeena Fold Belt, which spans most of the width of the northern Intermontane Belt, exhibits shortening comparable with that in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. The Skeena Fold Belt has many features of thin-skinned fold and thrust belts, such as thrust faults which sole into a detachment, a wide variety of structural styles which depend on rock type, a foreland basin which was cannibalized by continued deformation, a frontal triangle zone, and a hinterland of metamorphic and plutonic rocks (Coast Plutonic Complex). The Skeena Fold Belt thus is comparable with the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt, but rather than deforming a continental terrace wedge, it developed in a terrane (Stikinia) which had accreted to North America in the early Mesozoic, and in Jurassic and Cretaceous clastic successions (Bowser Lake and Sustut groups) which overlie Stikinia. Structural and stratigraphic relationships show that the earliest deformation occurred between Oxfordian and Albian time and that the last folds developed in latest Cretaceous or early Tertiary time. As much as 160 km of northeastward shortening in the Skeena Fold Belt was broadly contemporaneous with crustal thickening in the Coast Plutonic Complex and Omineca Belt, with dextral strike-slip faulting east of the Skeena Fold Belt, and with shortening in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. Therefore, between latest Jurassic and early Tertiary times, horizontal shortening occured across most of the width of the northern Canadian Cordillera. Concurrent shortening across the Cordillera suggests that a common detachment (or detachments) fed all of these zones as far east as the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt.

AB  - Spirituality and sexuality marked moral boundaries on the North American colonial frontier. Images of women's bodies and presumptions about female morality were central signifiers of relative stages of "civilization." Images created in the seventeenth century endure and persist in dividing aboriginal womanhood into the dichotomous and harmful categories of "princess" and "squaw." The continuing appeal of Pocahontas myths reveals the power of these images to affect contemporary understandings of morality and gender. This article considers the contemporary implications of frontier constructs of female sexuality and spirituality. If colonial and postcolonial relations are conceptualized as an enduring "im/moral" frontier, issues of spirituality and sexuality can be understood as complex negotiations of meaning that reflect changing power relations. Contemporary aboriginal women, metaphorical granddaughters of Pocahontas, confront their spiritual transformations in diverse ways. In central British Columbia they have done so alongside the move to beatify a former student of a residential school.

AB  - Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawning habitat. Information exists on the microhabitat characteristics that define suitable salmon spawning habitat. However, traditional spawning habitat models that use these characteristics to predict available spawning habitat are restricted because they can not account for the heterogeneous nature of rivers. We present a conceptual spawning habitat model for fall chinook salmon that describes how geomorphic features of river channels create hydraulic processes, including hyporheic flows, that influence where salmon spawn in unconstrained reaches of large mainstem alluvial rivers. Two case studies based on empirical data from fall chinook salmon spawning areas in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River are presented to illustrate important aspects of our conceptual model. We suggest that traditional habitat models and our conceptual model be combined to predict the limits of suitable fall chinook salmon spawning habitat. This approach can incorporate quantitative measures of river channel morphology, including general descriptors of geomorphic features at different spatial scales, in order to understand the processes influencing redd site selection and spawning habitat use. This information is needed in order to protect existing salmon spawning habitat in large rivers, as well as to recover habitat already lost.

AB  - In Dakelh (Carrier), as in many other Athapaskan languages, valence prefixes and “inner subject” prefixes interact in a complex pattern involving a combination of consonant deletion and/or fusion and, in certain conditions, what looks like epenthesis. In this paper we investigate this apparent epenthesis effect, which is otherwise unexpected in this environment in Dakelh and is problematic in several aspects (Gessner 2003). We propose that the epenthesis should be understood as an anti-homophony effect (Crosswhite 1999, Blevins 2004a, b) serving to systematically maintain a surface distinction between paradigmatically related forms differing in valence. We demonstrate how the anti-homophony effect is best understood in a diachronic-evolutionary context rather than a synchronicphonological one: “epenthesis” is really the blocking of syncope (as a regular historical sound change). The account constitutes a striking parallel to the explanation of so-called antigemination effects as the result of syncope blocking through homophony avoidance, as proposed by Blevins (2004a, b).

This study applies literature-derived indicators to examine urban change in the city of Prince George; British Columbia's northern capital. Findings illustrate that key growth nodes have largely performed (e.g., densified) at or below the level of their surrounding neighbourhood over time despite a robust set of policy tools associated with smart growth. This research is one of few to examine smart growth in a northern urban context, and situates the concept within the slow growth/no growth realities of many rural and remote regions.

AB  - Objectives Meaningful social engagement is important to reduce risk for social isolation and loneliness. First Nations Elders are a unique group and little knowledge currently exists of their preferred forms of social interaction. The objective of this study was to describe the types of programs Nak'azdli Elders desire, identify barriers to participation, and improve creation of programs that address Elders' needs and interests. Methods This project was co-created by the Nak'azdli Health Centre and Elders, located in Northern British Columbia, with support from academic partners when and where asked. An advisory committee selected participants perceived as able to complete the survey and available for interviewing. Participants were interviewed orally in English or Carrier in their homes or at a drop-in centre, by a well-respected Nak'azdli Elder. The Elder entered participant responses (including self-reported health, awareness and utilization for existing programs, and preferences for new programs) into a paper-based survey. Descriptive and content analysis were conducted. Results Nak'azdli Elders (N = 38) were interested in wisdom sharing, social programs, and health-related activities. Elders wanted to be actively engaged in programs/activity selection, helping organize programs, knowledge sharing, skills, and stories. Barriers to participation included lack of transportation, personal health concerns, scheduling conflicts, and lack of knowledge about programs/activities. Conclusion Nak'azdli Elders were interested in culturally relevant programs involving sharing cultural knowledge, teachings, and/or language with younger generations. Elders wanted to be engaged in all stages of activities, including planning, participation, and evaluation. Future programs should prioritize community collaboration and co-creation with Elders.

AB  - This article examines the implications and limitations of First Nations forestry negotiations in British Columbia (BC), Canada by assessing how effectively the Tl’azt’en Nation is able to realize benefits under the current form of negotiations. The primary goal of the Tl’azt’en Nation has always been to defend their Aboriginal interests within their ancestral lands, which would entail the cessation of clear-cutting on their traditional territory. Although the community has pursued some economic opportunities in the forestry sector to improve their socioeconomic conditions, despite their efforts, the socioeconomic status of the community remains unchanged. The collective experience of the Tl’azt’en Nation illustrates that simply obtaining certain forest tenures and short-term-based revenue sharing agreements does not adequately meet their forestry and self-sufficiency goals. Without addressing the fundamental issues and challenges facing the community, the current practice of forestry negotiations between the Provincial government and the Tl’azt’en Nation has produced no significant benefits to the community.

AB  - Snow‐dominated watersheds are bellwethers of climate change. Hydroclimate projections in such basins often ﬁnd reductions in annual peak runoff due to decreased snowpack under global warming. British Columbia's Fraser River Basin (FRB) is a large, nival basin with exposure to moisture‐laden atmospheric rivers originating in the Paciﬁc Ocean. Landfalling atmospheric rivers over the region in winter are projected to increase in both strength and frequency in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models. We investigate future changes in hydrology and annual peak daily streamﬂow in the FRB using a hydrologic model driven by a bias‐corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (8.5), the FRB evolves toward a nival‐pluvial regime featuring an increasing association of extreme rainfall with annual peak daily ﬂow, a doubling in cold season peak discharge, and a decrease in the return period of the largest historical ﬂow, from a 1‐in‐200‐year to 1‐in‐50‐year event by the late 21st century. Plain Language Summary: Snow‐covered areas of the globe are particularly sensitive to global warming. Future projections using global climate models generally show that as the ratio of snow to rain declines, river ﬂows peak earlier in the year with reduced volume. These models also capture the phenomenon of “atmospheric rivers”: long, meandering plumes of water vapor often originating over the tropical oceans that bring sustained, heavy precipitation to the west coasts of North America and northern Europe. The present‐day frequency of landfalling atmospheric rivers on the Canadian west coast is projected to increase nearly fourfold by the late 21st century, with a proportionate increase in extreme rainfall events. Our work is the ﬁrst to directly investigate the impact of these “rivers in the sky” on “rivers on the land” using climate model projections. Focusing on the Fraser River Basin, Canada's largest Paciﬁc watershed, and using a business‐as‐usual industrial emissions scenario, we show that the basin transitions from one where peak ﬂow results from spring snowmelt to one where peak ﬂow is often caused by extreme rainfall. Our modeling suggests that extreme rainfall events resulting from atmospheric rivers may lead to peak annual ﬂoods of historic proportions, and of unprecedented frequency, by the late 21st century in the Fraser River Basin.

AB  - This paper discusses an action research project in which the making and screening of a film was conceived as a catalyst for social change in a deeply divided community. The context is the history of segregation of Indigenous peoples and settlers in Canada. Is there a decolonizing role for planning, beginning with the work of healing and reconciliation? And, is there a role for film as a methodological tool in such a process? Our findings suggest a very necessary role for therapeutic planning, albeit with caveats; and, that film can be an effective catalyst for creating this therapeutic space.

AB  - PHABSIM, part of the Instream Flow Incremental Methodology, was used to predict the spawning habitat used by chinook salmon in a 600 m long section of the Nechako River, British Columbia, Canada. Predictions of the model were compared to the location and amount of habitat actually used by adult chinook salmon in 1974, 1980, and 1986. About 3800 m2 (70 per cent) of the spawning area actually used by the population were predicted as unusable by the ‘best’ prediction, while 87 per cent of the area predicted as usable has never had recorded use. The ‘best’ prediction resulted from using close transect spacing, frequent measurements along the transect, river-specific habitat suitability criteria, and modelling habitat at the fish's position near the stream bottom. Depending upon the spacing of the transects and the habitat suitability criteria used, PHABSIM predicted 210 per cent to 660 per cent more spawning habitat was available than historically had ever been used. Chinook salmon in the Nechako River spawn mainly on the upstream face of dunes, therefore, the assumption in PHABSIM that conditions predicted at the transects remain unchanged upstream and downstream part way to the adjacent transects was false. This assumption resulted in about two-thirds of the correct predictions being made for the wrong reason. The accuracy of PHABSIM's predictions for spawning might be improved by incorporating an index of river bottom topography or velocity gradient into the model.

AB  - The winter diets of northern mule deer are comprised predominantly of shrubs and trees. Included in winter diets are various species of conifers, some of which are important forestry and ornamental crop trees. Diet choices and feeding habits of mule deer utilizing conifer crops, however, have not been widely reported. Here, we document diet choices made by human-habituated mule deer from north central British Columbia during an exploratory cafeteria-style feeding trial using boughs of thirteen species of native North American and introduced European conifers. Mule deer consumed more biomass from exotic conifers (specifically pine) than from rarely encountered native conifers, and consumed the least biomass from those native conifers commonly encountered by deer in northern BC, a finding which appears to lend support to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis. From most to least biomass consumed, deer selected Mugho pine, Scots pine, western hemlock, subalpine fir, Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Ponderosa pine, western white pine, lodgepole pine, common juniper, red cedar, black spruce, and hybrid white spruce. Analysis of Variance testing suggested that deer preferred to eat exotic Mugho and Scots pine and avoided eating commonly encountered, native black and hybrid white spruce. A relationship also existed between the biomass consumed and the number of bites taken by deer from each species, which generally indicated that deer took more bites from exotic and rarely encountered conifers, but not always. Our results suggest that northern mule deer, therefore, may be more likely to damage introduced pine and other exotics relative to native species planted in either ornamental or forest plantation settings when deer densities are high and/or browse resources are limited.

AB  - We examine the importance of stream habitat characteristics in governing variation in spawning densities of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) across 32 streams in the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia, Canada. We used mixed-effects models to examine four competing hypotheses for the influence of abiotic stream characteristics acting on either adult salmon or embryo mortality. All models that received support using Akaike’s information criterion included stream characteristics that are associated with cover. These included the percent area of pools, percentage of the banks that were undercut, and large woody debris (in that order). These results suggest the importance of stream characteristics, which reduce risk of predation on adults, in determining spawning sockeye salmon densities. Thus, identification of a small number of physical characteristics of streams provides insight into ecological processes that determine population densities. This information can be used to quantify habitat quality, whic...,

AB  - The Omineca Crystalline Belt of the Canadian Cordillera is flanked on the west by the Hinterland Belt, characterized by folds and faults that show predominant westward directed tectonic transport. Rocks involved in northern and central British Columbia comprise the Cache Creek Group and, to the west, various Permian, Triassic and Jurassic units. The structures in this belt record three major episodes of deformation. Earliest folds in the Cache Creek Group probably reflect latest Triassic deformation and cannot be related to the Hinterland Belt for they trend obliquely to it. In northern and central British Columbia the Hinterland Belt as a structural entity was produced by probable latest Jurassic or earliest Cretaceous deformation. Major east-dipping thrust and reverse faults, associated locally with folds and schist terranes, bring Cache Creek strata over and against coeval and younger rocks to the west.

AB  - Remains of a partially articulate mammoth skeleton were exposed during stripping operations at a mining site on Babine Lake, central British Columbia. The bones lay in silty pond deposits in a bedrock depression, and were overlain by a thin layer of gravel and a thick layer of glacial till. Although no molar teeth were found, limb proportions show that the specimen was a large mammoth, like the Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus cf. M. columbi). Two radiocarbon dates of 42 900 ± 1860 yr B.P. and 43 800 ± 1830 yr B.P. on wood from the silty fossiliferous layer, and another of 34 000 ± 690 yr B.P. on mammoth bone suggest that the animal sank in sticky pond deposits and died there. Paleobotanical evidence indicates that, during this part of the Olympia Interglaciation, the vegetation near Babine Lake was similar to present shrub tundra just beyond the treeline in northern Canada., Les ossements d'un squelette de mammouth partiellement articulé ont été découverts au cours du décapage d'affleurements à un site minier du lac Babine au centre de la Colombie Britannique.

Même si on n'a pas trouvé de molaires, les proportions des membres indiquent que le mammouth était gros, comme le mammouth colombien (Mammuthus cf. M. columbi).

AB  - Understanding the mechanisms that decrease gene flow between diverging populations is critical to understanding speciation. Anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn sympatrically and interbreed, yet allele frequency differences at neutral loci indicate restricted gene flow. Disruptive natural selection associated with strong selective differences between anadromous and nonanadromous life histories is thought to maintain the genetic differentiation of the morphs. Recently, a putative third morph of O. nerka exhibiting green rather than red breeding colour has been found on the spawning grounds sympatric with sockeye and kokanee. We investigated the ancestry of these green fish in a 2-year controlled breeding study by using previously documented heritable, countergradient variation in red breeding colour to distinguish pure and hybrid morphs. Stabilizing sexual selection for similar red breeding colour in sockeye and kokanee has led to adaptive differences in the efficiency of carotenoid uptake between the morphs given differences in carotenoid availability between marine and lacustrine habitats. On the same diet, offspring parented by the green fish were intermediate in colour and in the concentration of dietary carotenoid pigments in their flesh and skin to those parented by either sockeye or kokanee; they were most similar to those parented by known kokanee × sockeye hybrids. This countergradient variation in carotenoid use results in a genotype-environment mismatch in nonanadromous hybrids that exposes them by their breeding colour on the spawning grounds. Given that red colour is important in mate choice, sexual selection will almost certainly reduce reproductive opportunities for these hybrids and promote sympatric divergence of these incipient species. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 84, 287–305.

Significant differences confirmed the hypothesis that the two Oncorhynchus nerka variants follow different reproductive strategies: (i) fecundity is more highly correlated with length for kokanee than for sockeye salmon; (ii) kokanee have higher fecundity-length regression slopes and lower intercepts than sockeye salmon; (iii) kokanee populations share a common fecundity-length regression slope, but sockeye salmon populations do not; and (iv) average lengths and fecundities of kokanee decrease with increasing latitude, but those of sockeye salmon do not. The first three findings confirm that kokanee maintain a constant egg size while increasing egg number with increasing body size but that sockeye salmon increase both egg number and egg size with increasing body size.

AB  - In recent years, a buoyant global market for minerals has led to renewed interest in the mining sector as a means of generating economic growth in resource producing areas of developed nations. The development of new operations, however, raises concerns around the impacts of mining activities on the environment, health and traditional ways of life of Indigenous peoples. Using the proposed expansion of the Kemess mine in northern British Columbia as a case study, this paper examines two First Nations’ perspectives regarding the regulatory process through which environmental values may be validated and protected, and seeks to understand how these First Nations’ environmental values and perceptions of risk are connected to health and well-being. Sixteen key informant interviews were carried out and thematically analyzed through political ecology and environmental justice frameworks. The paper argues that accommodating First Nations’ environmental values and perceptions of risks is a necessary first step to reclaim health and well-being in politically marginalized settings.

This paper describes the community development efforts underway since 1992 to create a positive healthy neighbourhood for residents of all ages. A review of literature explores First Nations traditional value and belief structures, the concept of integrative planning, theories of social learning and principles of community sustainability. Concepts of social capital are reviewed and the concept of sustainability capital is introduced. A case study approach is used to explore the community development process, identify positive and negative elements within the neighbourhood and to suggest methods and activities to aid in the facilitation of positive changes within the neighbourhood. Finally, ideas to integrate First Nations values and beliefs and relevant concepts of environmental sustainability within the development process are discussed.

We extended the typing of the DRB1 in an Amerindian group (Penutian) from British Columbia. The presence of the alleles DRB1∗ 0405, ∗0407 and ∗0410 only in Na-Dene and alleles DRB1∗0408, ∗1301∗1302, ∗1304, ∗1305, ∗1502 and ∗1601 only in Amerindians suggests separate origins of these two groups. There were fifteen different DRB1/DQA1/DQB1 haplotypes. One unique haplotype previously reported in Native Americans was found. Thirty-four per cent of Athabaskans presented Native American haplotype DRB1∗1402/DQA1∗0501/DQB1∗0301. In addition, the results of this study are compatible with previous evidence with mitochondrial (mtDNA) polymorphisms indicating that Amerindians and Na-Dene populations derived from different migrations from Asia.

AB  - To understand links between substrate and recruitment of white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), I evaluated the effects of substrate condition on larval drift, hiding, and predation between hatch and 15 days posthatch (dph). Over porous substrates (small gravel = 1.2–1.9 cm; medium gravel = 2.5–5.0 cm; cobble = 10–15 cm), rapid interstitial hiding was observed from 0 to 6 dph at low water velocity (4 cm·s–1), whereas larvae drifted in response to nonporous substrates (sand < 0.2 cm; embedded cobble). Velocities of 20 cm·s–1 led to significantly lower drift only at 1 dph over small gravel. Hiding occurred an average of 2.0–13.3 s after release at 0–6 dph. Predation by sculpins (Cottus spp.) on larval sturgeon also decreased significantly in response to porous substrates at 1 dph. The strongest expression of increased hiding and decreased predation when small gravel was available suggests that yolksac larvae prefer small interstitial spaces created by that substrate.

Sur les substrats poreux (gravier fin = 1,2–1,9 cm; gravier moyen = 2,5–5,0 cm; galets = 10–15 cm), on observe une dissimulation rapide dans la zone interstitielle de 0 à 6 dph à vitesse de courant faible (4 cm·s–1), alors que sur les substrats non poreux (sable < 0,2 cm; galets encastrés), les larves dérivent.

Spawners arriving first deposited their eggs in larger redds constructed in deeper, slower moving water. Redds constructed by late arriving fish were smaller on average and were usually located in relatively shallow, fast-flowing water. Late arriving fish also had a shorter average redd residence time. We suggest that progeny of early arriving spawners may have a selective advantage over progeny of late arriving fish in the same run., On trouvera ici une étude sur la répartition spatiale et les caractéristiques physiques des nids de saumons chinook (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) en fonction de la durée de l'occupation du nid et du moment où a commencé la construction du nid.

Les nids des poissons qui arrivent plus tard sont en moyenne plus petits et sont construits en eau relativement peu profonde à courant rapide; ces poissons occupent en moyenne leurs nids moins longtemps que les premiers arrivants. Il est probable que la progéniture des premiers arrivants soit avantagée par rapport à la progéniture des poissons arrivés plus tard au cours de la même saison.[Traduit par le journal]

AB  - There has been a great deal of controversy recently in British Columbia over the non-Canadian use of the province's recreational resources. Tourism is British Columbia's third largest industry, yet tourist facilities, especially publicly provided facilities, have been experiencing crowding problems, which many believe result in deterioration in the quality of the recreational experience. In July, 1973, British Columbia's Minister of Highways responded to this situation by advocating a ban on all United States' recreational vehicles.In the present paper the problems of recreational resource development are subjected to economic analysis. One group of non-Canadian users, namely, sport fishermen, is singled out for attention. The consequences of various relevant recreation policies are discussed on a regional basis, drawing on a selection of studies undertaken by the Northern Economics Unit, Federal Fisheries Service, in Vancouver.The conclusions of the paper are as follows. It is evident that public attitudes towards non-resident use of locally identified recreational resources vary significantly from one region to another.Overcrowded conditions prevailing in some areas are not evident in others and policies must be flexible enough to take account of regional variation. Furthermore, excess demand is often a reflection of inconsistent government policies which produce a gap between the planned utilisation and the planned provision of facilities. Under such conditions discrimination on the basis of residential status is likely to be carried to lengths beyond those justified by economic analysis. In particular, in the case of British Columbia, to focus attention on restricting non-Canadian use is to divert attention away from the real problem. In the final analysis, if governments are concerned with providing an optimal amount of good quality recreational opportunities and maximising the real net benefits accruing to residents under their jurisdictions, then a policy package more finely attuned to these objectives is necessary.

A whole-rock K–Ar date of 0.34 ± 0.03 Ma on the oldest flow is consistent with a hotspot model for the Anahim Belt and implies absolute late Neogene motion of 2.6 cm/year for North America. The hyaloclastite mound was erupted beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps during the Fraser Glaciation (25 000 – 10 000 years BP). Radiocarbon dates from peat above and below Nazko tephra in a bog near the cone suggest that the volcano last erupted about 7200 years BP.Nazko basalt has 10–15% normative nepheline and is classified as basanite. This is significantly more undersaturated than basalts farther west in..., Le cône de Nazko, localisé à l'extrémité orientale de la zone volcanique d'Anahim, en Colombie-Britannique centrale, doit son existence à au moins trois épisodes d'activité volcanique durant le Quaternaire. Une coulée subaérienne érodée, d'âge pléistocène, à la base de la pile est surmontée d'un monticule sous-glaciaire d'hyaloclastite qui, à son tour, est recouvert partiellement par un cône composite de pyroclastite accompagné de coulées de lave. La plus ancienne coulée fournit un âge K–Ar sur roche totale de 0,34 ± 0,03 Ma, s'accordant avec un modèle de point chaud pour la zone d'Anahim et impliquant, au Néogène tardif, un mouvement absolu de 2,6 cm/an pour l'Amérique du Nord. Le monticule d'hyaloclastite a été engendré par une éruption sous-jacente à l'inlandsis de la Cordillère durant le Pléistocène tardif, peut-être durant la glaciation Fraser (25 000 – 10 000 ans Av.P.). Les dates au radiocarbone obtenues sur des échantillons de tourbe prélevés, au-dessus et en-dessous du tephra de Nazko, dans une t...

AB  - Uniformity of water quality in the Upper Fraser River basin was examined using cluster analysis. Substantial variations in water quality exist within the basin. These differences are largely related to the geology of the watersheds. Differences in water quality were more pronounced among the tributaries than along the mainstem of the Fraser River. The mainstem of the river could be considered to have three distinct reaches where water quality properties were relatively constant. Cluster analysis was a useful technique for establishing similarities and differences for both the tributaries and the mainstem stations. Some limitations of water quality data and the methods used are discussed. The diversity of water quality found to exist within this basin suggests that uniform criteria or objectives cannot be applied to the basin as a whole, but may be applied to smaller units.

AB  - The high topographic relief and physiographic diversity of British Columbia make it a particularly difficult region in which to consider the potential of global environmental change to affect lake and stream habitats important for freshwater sportfish production. More importantly these provincial features intensify problems in predicting the magnitude and sometimes even the direction of such effects. Nevertheless a number of useful models are available to help predict these changes acting through alterations in stream discharge and periodicity, ice-free period, water temperature, epilimnial depth and volume, dissolved oxygen level and hypolomnetic depletion rate, all of which are major determinants of sportfish habitat quality and quantity. Not surprisingly there is great regional difference in the direction and severity of probable effects of global environmental change within the province — in some areas negative and in others positive. These are reviewed and suggestions made regarding management policies required to meet their challenge.

AB  - This paper reviews the geographic extent, distribution, plant communities, forage productivity and animal production of Crown range in British Columbia. Over 10 million ha of Crown range is distributed among 11 biogeoclimatic zones. Forestland comprises nearly 80% of the landbase grazed. In the southern interior, the most important zones include the Bunchgrass, Ponderosa Pine, Interior Douglas-Fir and Montane Spruce zones. Forage yields vary from as much as 2700 kg ha−1 on grassland to < 100 kg ha−1 under dense forest canopy. On seeded clearcuts, however, production may exceed 1500 kg ha−1. Average daily gains for steers and calves on forest range vary from 0.8 to 1.1 kg d−1. In the central interior and Peace River areas, the Sub-Boreal Pine–Spruce, Sub-Boreal Spruce and Boreal White and Black Spruce zones provide most of the forage for beef cattle. Seventeen community pastures, comprising nearly 170 000 ha, produce almost 50 000 animal-unit months (AUMs) of forage for cattle in this region. Forage produc..., L'article passe en revue l'étendue géographique, la répartition, les communautés végétales, la productivité fourragère et la production animale dans les terres de l'État en Colombie-Britannique (C.-B.). Plus de 10 millions d'hectares (ha) de parcours de l'État se répartissent entre 11 zones biogéoclimatiques. La forêt couvre près de 80% du territoire pâturé. Dans le sud de l'intérieur, les zones les plus importantes sont la zone à graminées cespiteuses, la zone du pin Ponderosa, la zone du Douglas de l'intérieur et la zone montagnarde à épinette. Le rendement fourrager peut aller de 2700 kg ha−1 sur prairie à moins de 100 kg ha−1 sous couvert forestier dense. Dans les coupes à blanc ressemées, la production peut toutefois dépasser 1500 kg ha−1. Le QMQ das bouvillons et des veaux dans les parcours de forêt va de 0,8 kg à 1,1 kg j−1.

AB  - ConclusionsThe widespread, explosive eruption of acid volcanic rocks in the early Tertiary represents a unique event in the Phanerozoic history of the Canadian Cordilleran orogen. It coincides with a period of general uplift during which the central part of the former eugeosyncline was subjected to tensional stresses resulting in rifting and block faulting accompanied by submissive intrusion of epizonal, acid plutons. Both the plutons and the acid volcanic rocks are considered to be products of the same magma. Periodic escape of gas from the tops of large magma chambers was accompanied by intense shattering of the roof rocks and expulsion of great volumes of gas-charged magma which produced the thick piles of welded tuff and ignimbrite that characterize the early Tertiary Sloko succession.The area underlain by the early Tertiary acid volcanic rocks coincides with that of the Whitehorse-Nechako Trough, a belt of prolonged subsidence in which the greatest thickness of eugeosynclinal sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated through most of Mesozoic time. This fact, plus the predominance of acidic rather than basic lavas and plutons in the early Tertiary of British Columbia, suggests that these rocks originated from primary anatectic magma rather than acid magma derived through differentiation of a more basic parent.

AB  - Basic components of predation processes are briefly reviewed and data on these components are presented for several native Indian food fisheries. Depensatory mortality emerges as a common effect of these fisheries, which supports findings of earlier workers on Skeena River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Native food fisheries therefore operate like natural "Type II" predators, and descriptive equations are provided for use by salmon managers and modelers.Key words: fishermen as predators, native, Indian, food, fisheries, salmon, depensation, L'auteur fait une brève revue des éléments de base de la prédation et présente, pour plusieurs pêcheries de subsistance pratiquées par les Indians, des données sur ces éléments. Comme effet commun de ces pêcheries, émerge une mortalité anticompensatoire, ce qui confirme les observations de chercheurs qui avaient déjà étudié le saumon nerka (Oncorhynchus nerka) de la rivière Skeena. Les pêcheries de subsistance des Indiens agissent donc comme prédateurs naturels de «type II», et on donne des équations descriptives pouvant être utilisées pour la gestion et l'élaboration de modèles de pêcheries de saumons.

AB  - Immediately after emergence from spawning gravels, fry of stream-type chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations from tributaries of the upper Fraser River, British Columbia, distribute themselves downstream from the spawning areas, throughout the natal stream, and into the Fraser River. We tested the hypothesis that this range in dispersal distances is caused by innate differences in nocturnal migratory tendency among individuals. Using an experimental stream channel, we found repeatable differences in downstream movement behaviour among newly emerged chinook fry. Fish that moved downstream were larger than those that held position in the channel. However, the incidence of downstream movement behaviours decreased over the first 2 weeks after emergence. We propose that the variation among individuals in downstream movement behaviour we observed leads to the dispersal of newly emerged fry throughout all available rearing habitats. Thus, between- and within-population variation in the freshwater ..., Immédiatement après l'émergence des lits de gravier des frayères, les alevins de saumon chinook de cours d'eau (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) appartenant aux populations des tributaires du cours supérieur du fleuve Fraser, en Colombie-Britannique, se dispersent en aval des aires de frais, dans l'ensemble du cours d'eau natal et dans le fleuve Fraser. Nous avons vérifié l'hypothèse que cette gamme de distances de dispersion soit attribuable à des différences innées dans les tendances migratoires nocturnes chez les individus. En utilisant un chenal de cours d'eau expérimental, nous avons observé des différences répétées dans le comportement de déplacement en aval chez les alevins de saumon chinook nouvellement émergés. Les poissons qui se sont déplacés vers l'aval étaient de taille plus grande que ceux qui sont demeurés sur place dans le chenal. Cependant, l'incidence des comportements de déplacement vers l'aval a diminué au cours des deux premières semaines suivant l'émergence. Nous estimons que la variation o...

AB  - An evaluation of how coarse woody debris (CWD) changes in quantity and quality during stand development was conducted using a 426-year chronosequence of 71 stands in sub-boreal forests in British Columbia. Additional characteristics of CWD were determined in 14 of the stands. Most stands are fire initiated and input from the predisturbance stand is critical in controlling the amounts and characteristics of CWD within young stands. Log volume declines from over 100 m3/ha in young stands (0-50 years) to just over 60 m3/ha in stands from 51 to 200 years old, and then increases to greater than 140 m3/ha in the oldest (>= 400-year-old) stands. Mean snag basal area is highest (31.6 m2/ha) in young, postfire stands, decreases to a very low value (2.0 m2/ha) in stands 51-100 years old, and then reaches a second maximum (12.1 m2/ha) in stands that are 201-250 years old; it declines slightly in very old stands.

Des caractéristiques supplémentaires des débris ligneux on été mesurées dans 14 des peuplements. La plupart des peuplements sont issus de feux et l'apport des peuplements qui ont précédé la perturbation est un élément critique pour déterminer la quantité et les caractéristiques des débris ligneux retrouvés dans les jeunes peuplements. Le volume des arbres morts au sol est passé de plus de 100 m3/ha dans les jeunes peuplements (0-50 ans), à 60 m3/ha dans les peuplements de 51-200 ans pour ensuite atteindre une valeur maximale de plus de 140 m3/ha dans les plus vieux peuplements (>= 400 ans).

AB  - An extensive but generally thin mantle of basalt flows, the Chilcotin Group, covers much of the Interior Plateau of south-central British Columbia. It provides material for dating and for reconstructing the original form of the paleosurface on which it was deposited. K–Ar whole-rock dates demonstrate that several ages of basalt are represented, from Early Miocene (or even Late Oligocene?) to Early Pleistocene, with particularly abundant eruptions about 14–16, 9–6, and 1–3 Ma ago.Basalts of Middle Miocene and later ages, if not the Early Miocene relics as well, clearly rest on land surfaces of low local relief. In places the low-relief surfaces had been incised to depths of 100–200 m and the valleys backfilled with mid-or late Cenozoic sediments prior to burial by the basalts. The low-relief surfaces throughout the area are believed to have been developed close to a common base level, and regional differences in their present elevation are thus largely a product of post-basalt deformation. This is recorded..., Un manteau de coulées de basalte, étalé sur une grande superficie, généralement de faible épaisseur, recouvre la majeure partie du plateau Intérieur du centre-sud de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces basaltes ont été datés, et le paléorelief sur lequel repose ce manteau de basaltes a été reconstitué. Les datations K–Ar sur roche totale révèlent la présence de plusieurs coulées d'âge différent, partant du Miocène précoce (ou même Oligocène tardif?) jusqu'au Pléistocène précoce, et avec des éruptions particulièrement abondantes datées à 14–16, 9–6 et 1–3 Ma.Les basaltes d'âge miocène moyen ou plus récent, n'excluant pas les coulées résiduelles d'âge miocène précoce, reposent nettement sur des surfaces de terrain à faible relief local. En certains endroits, les surfaces de faible relief furent érodées pour former des vallées de 100–200 m de fond, comblées ultérieurement par des sédiments d'âge cénozoïque moyen à tardif et ensuite recouvertes à leur tour par les coulées de basalte.

AB  - To estimate the parameters that govern mass- and temperature-dependent growth, we conducted a meta-analysis of existing growth data from juvenile Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha that were fed an ad libitum ration of a pelleted diet. Although the growth of juvenile Chinook Salmon has been well studied, research has focused on a single population, a narrow range of fish sizes, or a narrow range of temperatures. Therefore, we incorporated the Ratkowsky model for temperature-dependent growth into an allometric growth model; this model was then fitted to growth data from 11 data sources representing nine populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon. The model fit the growth data well, explaining 98% of the variation in final mass. The estimated allometric mass exponent (b) was 0.338 (SE = 0.025), similar to estimates reported for other salmonids. This estimate of b will be particularly useful for estimating mass-standardized growth rates of juvenile Chinook Salmon. In addition, the lower thermal limit, optimal temperature, and upper thermal limit for growth were estimated to be 1.8°C (SE = 0.63°C), 19.0°C (SE = 0.27°C), and 24.9°C (SE = 0.02°C), respectively. By taking a meta-analytical approach, we were able to provide a growth model that is applicable across populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon receiving an ad libitum ration of a pelleted diet.Received May 20, 2014; accepted December 4, 2014

AB  - This paper examines the ontological politics of an encounter between proposed energy pipelines and Indigenous peoples. The Enbridge Corporation has applied to construct a pipeline system to deliver diluted bitumen from the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, but the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and their member communities have asserted the authority to prevent this project from passing through their unceded territories. Studying Carrier Sekani contestation of Canadian regulatory assessment of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project, we examine how the processes of Indigenous becoming exceed notions of Indigenous being that are included in the permitting process as traditional knowledge. We focus both on the performance of legal obligations to consider Aboriginal traditional knowledge and the emerging politics of Carrier Sekani resistance. Our intention is not to question the integrity of traditional knowledge that the regulatory process incorporates, but to highlight how traditional knowledge functions as an anchor for a field of governmental inquiry and action. Providing a historical and geographical context of Carrier Sekani relations with development and the state, we argue that the coding of Indigenous being as traditional works to disavow contemporary processes of Indigenous becoming that are surplus to the spatial ontology of capitalist energy development for global markets. Against efforts to sanction development on disputed territory through formal recognition of a constrained Indigeneity, Carrier Sekani people assert the sovereign authority to prevent or permit development on their lands and waterways using traditional governance systems. Broadly, this paper suggests that recognizing the ontological politics at stake in this permitting process provides a useful opening to understand continued colonial captures at work in the inclusion of traditional knowledge in environmental governance. But it also demonstrates the capacity of Indigenous resistance to these enclosures to challenge and reshape global geographies of energy, capitalism, and climate.

AB  - This paper evaluates an innovative two-tiered model of collaborative planning designed to increase participation of First Nations in resource and environmental planning in British Columbia, Canada. Like a one-tiered model, the two-tiered model engages stakeholders in face-to-face negotiations to develop a consensus plan. However, to finalize an agreement, recommendations from the first tier are then sent to a second tier of negotiations that includes only two parties – First Nations and the provincial government. This innovative two-tiered collaborative process was designed to meet the unique position of First Nations and address the problem of low First Nations participation in previous single-tiered collaborative planning processes. Results based on 26 evaluative criteria indicate the two-tiered process was successful in increasing First Nations engagement while still meeting the interests of non-aboriginal stakeholders who did not participate at the second tier of negotiations. However, results also indicate a need to revise the two-tiered process to improve buy-in from non-aboriginal stakeholders while continuing to respect First Nations' constitutional rights. With these revisions, results suggest that a two-tiered collaborative planning model is a viable option worthy of consideration for cases in which one or more participants, such as aboriginal populations, have unique rights and interests that need to be accommodated in the process design.

In doing so, Tl'azt'en First Nation encountered challenges that reverberate today for indigenous peoples seeking timber rights in Canada. The authors demonstrate that considerable tensions exist between traditional First Nations values and the values of a commercial forestry operations and that finding reconciliation between these different values is not easy. Tl'azt'en Nation's experiences suggest several key factors for communities to consider and address in undertaking forestry operations that meet indigenous community values and goals. Further, forest companies looking to work with First Nations should understand some of the concerns First Nation communities are faced with in planning for community supported forestry operations.

AB  - Abstract Integrated river basin management (IRBM) is an approach that has been interpreted in a number of different ways during the last 100 years. Current support for IRBM is based on a ‘myth’ of inter‐agency co‐ordination. However, increasing complexity and uncertainty in river basin systems has created ‘wicked’ or ‘messy’ land and water management problems. The limited capacity of state institutions to deal effectively with such conditions suggests that the current ‘myth’ must be reformed and that a more powerful system‐response capability founded on inter‐organisational collaboration should be developed. The case for a collaborative institutional approach to IRBM is examined with reference to the Fraser Basin Council in British Columbia, Canada.

AB  - Rural and small town places in developed economies are aging. While attention has been paid to the local transportation needs of rural seniors, fewer researchers have explored their regional transportation needs. This is important given policies that have reduced and regionalized many services and supports. This article explores mobility constraints impeding rural seniors' access to regionalized services using the example of northern British Columbia. Drawing upon several qualitative studies, we explore geographical, maintenance, organizational, communication, human resources, infrastructure, and financial constraints that affect seniors' regional mobility. Our findings indicate that greater coordination across multiple government agencies and jurisdictions is needed and more supportive policies and resources must be in place to facilitate a comprehensive regional transportation strategy. In addition to discussing the complexities of these geographies, the article identifies innovative solutions that have been deployed in northern British Columbia to support an aging population. This research provides a foundation for developing a comprehensive understanding of the key issues that need to be addressed to inform strategic investments in infrastructure and programs that support the regional mobility and, hence, healthy aging of rural seniors.

AB  - Abstract Calls for community forestry on public forests grew in strength in both British Columbia and the United States during the 1990s, as part of a global movement touting the advantages of community control over centralized state administration of forests. Despite structural similarities, the trajectories of community forestry in the two locations diverged sharply, with community forests rapidly becoming a reality in British Columbia while similar proposals in the United States were blocked. This article explains these divergent trajectories by examining the differences in property relations, state institutions, stakeholder interests, and environmental social-movement strategies that led to nearly opposite outcomes in initially similar situations. It also analyzes community forestry in British Columbia relative to current debates over neoliberalism and alternative economies, arguing that detailed examination of such empirical examples demonstrates the utility of neoliberalism as an analytical concept.

AB  - This paper presents a modelling study on the spatial and temporal variability of climate-induced hydrologic changes in the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada. This large basin presents a unique modelling case due to its physiographic heterogeneity and the potentially large implications of changes to its hydrologic regime. The macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model was employed to simulate 30-year baseline (1970s) and future (2050s) hydrologic regimes based on climate forcings derived from eight global climate models (GCMs) runs under three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2). Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation was used to statistically downscale GCM outputs to the resolution of the VIC model (1/16°). The modelled future scenarios for the 11 sub-basins and three regions (eastern mountains, central plateau and coastal mountains) of the FRB exhibit spatially varied responses, such as, shifts from snow-dominant to hybrid regime in the eastern and coastal mountains and hybrid to rain-dominant regime in the central plateau region. The analysis of temporal changes illustrated considerable uncertainties in the projections obtained from an ensemble of GCMs and emission scenarios. However, direction of changes obtained from the GCM ensembles and emissions scenarios are consistent amongst one another. The most significant temporal changes could include earlier onsets of snowmelt-driven peak discharge, increased winter and spring runoff and decreased summer runoff. The projected winter runoff increases and summer decreases are more pronounced in the central plateau region. The results also revealed increases in the total annual discharge and decreases in the 30-year mean of the peak annual discharge. Such climate-induced changes could have implications for water resources management in the region. The spatially and temporally varied hydro-climatic projections and their range of projections can be used for local-scale adaptation in this important water resource system for British Columbia.

AB  - Drawing on the example of community forestry in British Columbia, Canada, this paper conceptualises and empirically assesses key contributors to successful community economic development, with a special emphasis on the role of local community support and inclusive participation. Relevant scholarship highlights the importance of these factors for achieving success with any community economic development (CED) initiative. While the initial experiences of 10 community forest initiatives under British Columbia's Community Forest Pilot Project offers evidence to corroborate this view, it is also evident that expertise and leadership, even of the exclusive variety, can substitute for community support and participation, if the goal of CED is to create a profitable community enterprise capable of delivering jobs and revenues to community members.

AB  - An inventory of provincial lakes and reservoirs has been developed to characterise and assess the distribution and morphometry of standing water bodies in British Columbia. In the province, there are over 241,500 lakes and reservoirs greater than 1,000 m2in size. These water bodies cover 2.37 percent of the province area and contain an estimated 521 km3of water (312 km3in natural lakes and 209 km3in reservoirs). A hypsometric relation suitable for order-of-magnitude estimates of lake volume from lake area is presented. Based on the distribution and morphometric attributes of lakes, several distinctive limnologic regions were identified, including the northeastern Alberta Plateau (highest proportion of circular lakes), the southwestern Alberta Plateau (lowest lake density/coverage and highest proportion of irregularly shaped lakes) and the Milbanke Strandflat (highest density of lakes). Observed regional and scale-related patterns in lake distribution/morphometry appear to be largely related to geomorphic controls, particularly tectonic and glacial history. Large-scale hydrologic implications of these standing water bodies and potential ecosystem/water resource management applications of the provincial inventory are also discussed.

AB  - As a result of experimental infections in chicks, diplostomula found in the retina of chinook salmon from the Nechako River were identified as Diplostomum (Diplostomum) baeri bucculentum. Eyeflukes in other salmonids were considered to be the same species based on similar measurements and site in the eyes. These eyeflukes varied in prevalence and mean intensity in seven salmonid species surveyed in nine localities in 1979–1981. The following fish were sampled: rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), 505; mountain whitefish (Prosopium williamsoni), 334; lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis), 32; Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), 66; lake trout (S. namaycush), 13; kokanee or sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), 323; and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), 164. Eyeflukes had prevalences ranging from 84 to 100% in six lakes, 64% in the river, 53% in one reservoir site, and a prevalence of 15% in the other reservoir site. Mountain and lake whitefishes had high mean intensities while kokanee had low mean intensities.

Les douves trouvées dans les yeux d'autres salmonidés se sont avérées être de la même espèce d'après leurs dimensions et leur position dans l'oeil. La fréquence et la gravité moyenne des infections a été déterminée chez sept espèces de salmonidés examinées en neuf stations de 1979 à 1981 : 505 truites arc-en-ciel (Salmo gairdneri), 334 ménominis des montagnes (Prosopium williamsoni), 32 corégones de lac (Coregonus clupeaformis), 66 Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma), 13 touladis (S. namaycush), 323 saumons kokanee ou nerka (Oncorhynchus nerka) et 164 saumons chinook (O. tshawytscha).

AB  - To determine use of riparian habitats by birds in the northern coniferous forest of British Columbia, we censused birds and vegetation along 500 m transects placed parallel and perpendicular to three second-order streams. Censuses were conducted during spring, summer, autumn, and winter to investigate how use of riparian habitat changed seasonally. Stream-side riparian zones were characterized by a dense understorey of deciduous vegetation not found in the upslope forest. Nine bird species preferred the riparian understorey for breeding, six preferred it only during migration. Neotropical migrants (16 of 46 species) were more closely associated with stream-sides than year-round residents (11 species). Some breeding birds (five species) were significantly negatively associated with riparian habitats. The density of riparian birds declined with distance upstream but did not decline up to 250 m away from the stream. The more extensive riparian areas downstream supported a greater density of birds in all seasons compared to upstream areas, but more species only in spring and autumn. Species that nested in non-riparian areas in summer used riparian habitat in autumn, making riparian corridors in the northern coniferous forest important during migration. Maintaining both riparian and upslope habitats is necessary to preserve species diversity al the landscape level.

AB  - This article explores the potential for building capacity to plan and develop ecotourism in a traditionally forest-dependent indigenous community in central British Columbia (BC), Canada. It is based on fieldwork conducted in 2001 and 2002, consisting mainly of two community workshops, and a survey of 128 Tl'azt'en Nation households. Results show that there is significant potential for ecotourism development in the Tl'azt'en territory. The Tl'azt'en have a strong desire to be involved in ecotourism; however, they are incognisant of the challenges and opportunities that come with its development. There is a general lack of commitment to a shared responsibility in the planning and management of ecotourism. Four potential obstacles to fully realise the development of ecotourism include the speculation that most commercial ‘niches’ are already filled; lack of clearly identified target visitor markets; competing interests from other northern BC communities that have similar resources; and stereotypical images of First Nations in Canada. The article suggests several strategies, including the capitalisation of Tl'azt'enne knowledge of the resources, building networks with other aboriginal and non-aboriginal agencies and individuals, exploring opportunities for educating and training the youth in tourism and small enterprise development, and building partnerships with tour operators.

AB  - British Columbia's energy policy is at a crossroads; the province has set a goal of electricity self-sufficiency, a 93% renewable portfolio standard and a natural gas development strategy that could increase electricity consumption by 21 TWh to 33 TWh. To ascertain the BC's supply position, a mathematical programming model of the physical workings of BC's hydroelectric generating system is developed, with head heights at the two dominant power stations treated as variable. Using historical water inflow and reservoir level data, the model is used to investigate whether BC is capable of meeting its self-sufficiency goals under various water supply and electricity demand scenarios.

AB  - This paper addresses the means by which the government of Canada is fulfilling its fiduciary obligation to consult with Aboriginal communities whose traditionally used lands are subject to industrial development. Specifically, the use of Aboriginal land use studies, as a means of consultation, is called into question on the basis of methodological limitations and cultural misrepresentation. In closing, it is suggested that until the Canadian government is prepared to take a proactive stance in mitigating land use conflicts through an effective and equitable consultative framework one should expect an escalation of litigation and continued Aboriginal discord.

AB  - Riprap, consisting of large boulders or concrete blocks, is extensively used to stabilize streambanks and to inhibit lateral erosion of rivers, yet its effect on river morphology and its ecological consequences have been relatively little studied. In this paper, we review the available information, most of it culled from the “grey” literature. We use a simple one-dimensional morphodynamic model as a conceptual tool to illustrate potential morphological effects of riprap placement in a gravel-bed river, which include inhibition of local sediment supply to the channel and consequent channel bed scour and substrate coarsening, and downstream erosion. Riprap placement also tends to sever organic material input from the riparian zone, with loss of shade, wood input, and input of finer organic material. Available information on the consequences for the aquatic ecosystem mainly concerns effects on commercially and recreationally important fishes. The preponderance of studies report unfavorable effects on local numbers, but habitat niches created by openings in riprap can favorably affect invertebrates and some small fishes. There is a need for much more research on both morphological and ecosystem effects of riprap placement.

AB  - Recent improvements in forecast skill of the climate system by dynamical climate models could lead to improvements in seasonal streamflow predictions. This study evaluates the hydrologic prediction skill of a dynamical climate model–driven hydrologic prediction system (CM-HPS), based on an ensemble of statistically downscaled outputs from the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS). For comparison, historical and future climate traces–driven ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) was employed. The Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) hydrologic model setup for the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada, was used as a test bed for the two systems. In both cases, results revealed limited precipitation prediction skill. For streamflow prediction, the ESP approach has very limited or no correlation skill beyond the months influenced by initial hydrologic conditions, while the CM-HPS has moderately better correlation skill, attributable to the enhanced temperature prediction skill that results from CanSIPS’s ability to predict El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its teleconnections. The root-mean-square error, bias, and categorical skills for the two methods are mostly similar. Hydrologic modeling uncertainty also affects the prediction skill, and in some cases prediction skill is constrained by hydrologic model skill. Overall, the CM-HPS shows potential for seasonal streamflow prediction, and further enhancements in climate models could potentially to lead to more skillful hydrologic predictions.

The myocardial cell-surface (functional) β2-AR density of O. nerka smolts sampled at the headwaters of the Chilko River was 54·2 fmol mg protein−1 and about half of that previously found in return migrating adults of the same population, but still more than twice that of adult hatchery O. mykiss (21·1 fmol mg protein−1). This technique now opens the possibility of investigating cardiac receptor density in a much wider range of fish species and life stages.

Morphologically, Eubothrium tulipai differs from other Eubothrium species in the shapes of the scolex, ovary, and cirrus sac. The new species differs from E. rugosum and E. salvelini, the two other freshwater species located in the Fraser drainage system, in the protuberant, powerful bothria, small, round apical disk, and constricted cirrus sac. Biologically it differs further from the two species in parasitizing a cyprinid host and is probably specific to cyprinid fish in British Columbia.,

The objectives of the study were to collect Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to gain an understanding of the criteria for gathering individual plants for food or medicine use, and to understand why traditional plant gathering sites may fall out of use. Multiple methods were used to gather information from knowledgeable Tl'azt'enne community members including focus groups, interviews, and field trips. Community members possess deep understandings of plants and their gathering sites. People’s concerns include the loss of TEK and changing landscapes due to the effects of disturbances on their lands. The knowledge gathered and documented throughout the study can be used to promote the preservation of the culture and language of Tl'azt'en Nation

AB  - The bias correction of climate model outputs is based on the main assumption of the time invariance of the bias, in which the statistical relationship between observations and climate model outputs in the historical period stays constant in the future period. The present study aims to assess statistical bias correction under nonstationary bias conditions and its implications on the simulated streamﬂow over two snowmelt-driven Canadian catchments. A pseudoreality approach is employed in order to derive a proxy of future observa- tions. In this approach, CRCM–ECHAM5 ensemble simulations are used as pseudoreality observations to correct for bias in the CRCM–CGCM3 ensemble simulations in the reference (1971–2000) period. The cli- mate model simulations are then bias corrected in the future (2041–70) period and compared with the future pseudoreality observations. This process demonstrates that biases (precipitation and temperature) remain after the bias correction. In a second step, the uncorrected and bias-corrected CRCM–CGCM3 simulations are used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model in both periods. The bias correction decreases the error on mean monthly streamﬂow over the reference period; such ﬁndings are more mixed over the future period. The results of various hydrological indicators show that the climate change signal on streamﬂow obtained with uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is similar in both its magnitude and its direction for the mean monthly streamﬂow only. Regarding the indicators of extreme hydrological events, more mixed results are found with site dependence. All in all, bias correction under nonstationary bias is an additional source of uncertainty that cannot be neglected in hydrological climate change impact studies.

AB  - Projected climate change effects on streamflow are investigated for the 2041–2070 horizon following the SRES A2 emissions scenario over two snowmelt-dominated catchments in Canada. A 16-member ensemble of SWAT hydrological model (HM) simulations, based on a comprehensive ensemble of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) simulations driven by two global climate models (GCMs), with five realizations of the Canadian CGCM3 and three realizations of the German ECHAM5 is established per catchment. This study aims to evaluate, once model bias has been removed by statistical post-processing (SP), how the RCM-simulated climate changes differ from those of the parent GCMs, and how they affect the assessment of climate change-induced hydrological impacts at the catchment scale. The variability of streamflow caused by the use of different SP methods (mean-based versus distribution-based) within each statistical post-processing pathway of climate model outputs (bias correction versus perturbation) is also evaluated, as well as the uncertainty of natural climate variability. The simulations cover 1971–2000 in the reference period and 2041–2070 in the future period. For a set of criteria, results based on raw and statistically post-processed model outputs for the reference climate are compared with observations. This process demonstrates that SP is important not only for GCMs outputs, but also for CRCM outputs. SP leads to a high level of agreement between the CRCM and the driving GCMs in reproducing patterns of observed climate. The ensemble spread of the climate change signal on streamflow is large and varies with catchments and hydrological periods (winter/summer flows). The results of various hydrological indicators show that most of the uncertainty arises from the natural climate variability followed by the statistical post-processing. The uncertainty linked to the choice of statistical pathway is much larger than that associated with the choice of the method in quantifying the hydrological impacts. We find that the incorporation of dynamical downscaling of global models through the CRCM as an intermediate step in the GCM–RCM–SP–HM model chain does not lead to considerable differences in the assessment of the climate change impacts on streamflow for the study catchments.

Our research during this period (2009–2011), the Northern Economic Vision II (NEV II) project, sought to investigate whether communities in the region were incorporating some of the core findings, lessons from an earlier project, the NEV I project (conducted in 2002–2005), in terms of preparing for both economic uncertainty and opportunity through place-oriented community planning and enhanced regional collaboration. Findings suggest that in the face of economic hardship, many communities continued to pursue community and regionally-oriented strategies in an attempt to preserve services and quality of life for local residents, and did not engage in reactive budget cuts in the face of economic decline, as experienced in previous bust periods.

AB  - Adaptation has lagged behind mitigation in climate change research and action, and there are currently few examples of proactive community adaptation plans in Canada or around the world. However, adaptation is being increasingly recognized as a necessary action to respond to changes in the climate as societies concurrently mitigate to minimize future anthropogenic climatic forcing. Environmental planners will play a leading role in assisting communities as they face the challenge of preparing for a changing and uncertain future. This research uses a self-assessment survey and workshop to provide a perspective of planner knowledge of climate change adaptation. It also explores climate impacts in communities across the province of British Columbia, Canada, and barriers to effective adaptation. The results indicate that planners do not have a high level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The top impacts that planners believe will affect British Columbia are related to forests, agriculture and river flooding. Planners want adaptation incorporated into existing documents (such as community, regional and provincial plans) rather than separate adaptation plans. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to promote capacity building related to climate change adaptation among planners.

While ideas of place have been incorporated into research on social and community resilience and adaptation, the existing work tends to focus on sense of place or place attachment. Generally, it does not account for the roles of place character or infrastructure. This article develops a novel three-part framework—incarnate, discarnate, and chimerical place—to provide a richer description of how place acts a system to inform social adaptation to crises, and specifically how it informs community resilience or transformation. This framework is demonstrated through case studies of two forest-dependent communities in British Columbia, Canada, adapting to local mill closures.

We highlight two organizations that are working to create ethical space and cultural safety at the intersections of Indigenous knowledge about health and wellness, Western medicine, and healthcare services for Indigenous peoples in Canada. The article argues that the cultural, organizational, and systemic transformations necessary to address the deep and ongoing health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations should be rooted in Indigenous knowledges and should prioritize Indigenous voices, values, and concepts. Cultural safety, ethical space, and Two-Eyed Seeing are three examples of ideas anchored in Indigenous knowledges that speak to relationships at the interface of different systems of knowledge. We offer some examples of how a public health knowledge translation centre and a regional health service delivering organization are actualizing these concepts in their work nationally and regionally in northern British Columbia, Canada.

AB  - Site preparation can improve lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson) survival and growth; however, we lack information regarding possible interactions between treatment effects and the impacts of western gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii (J.P. Moore) Y. Hirats.) and comandra blister rust (Cronartium comandrae Peck). Mechanical and burning techniques examined over 24 years at a sub-boreal British Columbia site did not significantly increase rust infection rates or characteristics relative to an untreated control. Most infection occurred before age 10 years and at heights <2 m. By age 24 years, 22% and 10% of pine had sustained at least one western gall rust or comandra blister rust stem infection, respectively, but only 4% of western gall rust infected trees were dead, compared with 60% of comandra blister rust infected trees.

AB  - Both birds and plants are major components of the world's biocultural diversity. Salient species of both are recognized and named in virtually every language and both feature in countless ways in people's systems of knowledge, practice, and belief, as sources of food, materials, and medicines, and as ceremonial and religious symbols. However, these two major biological groups are also linked together, and their ecological associations are likewise reflected in cultural knowledge systems. In northwestern North America, there are many examples of the intersection of botanical and ornithological knowledge, reflected in people's vocabulary, narratives, belief systems, and management practices. Here we provide diverse illustrations of this intersection in cultural knowledge of plant-bird associations. These examples link together observations of bird habits and habitats with particular plant species and show how this complex integrated knowledge and experience has helped promote cultural richness and well-being for First Peoples of the region. Bird species from swans (Cygnus spp.) to hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and plants from edible root vegetables to nectar-producing flowers are exemplified as major representatives of ethnoecological connections. These relationships remind us of the importance of interspecies ties to environmental and cultural integrity—a key to sustainable living into the future.

AB  - Fine sediment derived from catchment erosion can adversely impact aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies of lake sediment deposits in western Canada attributed increased sedimentation to land use; however, high catchment variability and short- and long-term climatic responses complicated the interpretation of those regional records. We compiled a large inventory of lake catchment data transecting the Canadian cordillera that comprised 210Pb-based profiles of deposition, GIS-based land use records, and interpolated climate change data. We used these data and mixed-effects modeling to relate sedimentation trends to land use and climate change since the mid-20th century. Although sedimentation was highly variable, increasing trends in accumulation corresponded with cumulative land use and, to a lesser degree, with climate change. Road density was the most important variable, but the inclusion of timber harvesting density further improved model fits significantly. Land use effects were more difficult to discern for the easternmost region of the Alberta Plateau where sedimentation appeared to be cumulatively associated with both timber and energy resource extraction. Stronger relations were obtained with whole catchment (0.50–273 km2) measures of land use, suggesting that fine sediment is efficiently transferred from hillslopes to the lake basins. While accounting for land use, a climate signal was also detected with improved model fits obtained with the inclusion of catchment warming. Further modeling results suggest that at least one critical control of reconstructed sedimentation remains undetermined. Interdecadal rates of lake sedimentation in western Canada have steadily increased during the late 20th century, following patterns of regional environmental change.

AB  - Community-based research (CBR) represents a particularly timely approach to rural research. Rural areas in industrialized nations are undergoing dramatic and rapid processes of economic, social and political restructuring. These forces, combined with a trend towards place-based development and territorial policy make CBR an appropriate rural method given its flexibility and sensitivity to local context. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the use and methods of CBR in the rural setting, drawn from our collective research experience in northern British Columbia. There has been increased attention paid to CBR, signalling a form of acceptance within the academy towards community-based and participatory methods. However, gaps exist in addressing the various approaches to conducting CBR and in considering the relevance of CBR in different contexts. Researchers also note the need for better training in the use of community-based methods. We reflect upon our rural CBR experience to offer insights and pragmatic lessons on effective methodological practices using a simplified framework of the key research process stages: preparing for community engagement, doing community-based research and after the fieldwork.

AB  - Throughout the 1800s and the 1900s, woodland caribou disappeared from much of the central and southern portions of British Columbia, Canada. Conversely, moose populations expanded during the 1900s and rapidly colonized forested areas formerly occupied by caribou. Although the general trend in range recession and expansion is documented, the processes, timing, and spatial extent of overlap between these two ungulates are uncertain. Such details have implications for our understanding of the ecology of these species and the conservation of woodland caribou. Using historical-ecological methods, we documented the distribution and abundance of caribou and moose over a 150-year period. Also, we evaluated three general sources of evidence for documenting long-term changes in the distribution of hunted or trapped fauna: (1) semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents; (2) journals of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC); and (3) primary written sources. The findings of this study suggested that caribou were relatively wide-spread throughout the study area until the late 1800s when their distribution began to decline. The first recorded sighting of moose in the study area was 1832, although consensus among sources suggested that moose expanded into the area at the end of the 1800s becoming abundant in the 1920s and 1930s. Proposed causes of decline of caribou included climatic change during the 1800s and habitat loss, hunting, and altered predator-prey dynamics through the early 1900s. Our analysis of three sources of historical information and knowledge confirmed the value of Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in documenting and explaining long-term historical distribution of hunted species. Alternatively, HBC journals and other written sources provided good temporal specificity, but few recorded locations of caribou or moose. Documenting changes in the long-term distribution of both species can enlighten conservation planning for woodland caribou.

AB  - This article describes the belief in reincarnation held by the contemporary Wet'suwet'en, or Bulkley River Carrier Indians, based on twenty-eight cases investigated using the methods of Ian Stevenson. The Wet'suwet'en cases are compared to the cases I have studied among two neighboring native groups in British Columbia, Canada: the Gitksan to the west and the Beaver to the northeast. The three groups have different beliefs in the possibility of cross-sex and multiple reincarnation which may relate to their differing attitudes towards succession to hereditary titles. However, the concept of reincarnation gives all three groups a similar perspective on personality formation which affects the way children are treated. While cultural patterning shapes the belief in reincarnation, further research is necessary to assess whether something like reincarnation may be actually taking place.

AB  - Using fisheries agency databases and files, we assembled a summary database on the status of anadromous salmon stocks (genus Oncorhynchus) from British Columbia and Yukon streams. We then collected supplementary information by circulating the database among fisheries professionals and interest groups throughout British Columbia and thus identified 9,662 anadromous salmon stocks. These stocks included 866 chinook, 1,625 chum, 2,594 coho, 2,169 pink, 917 sockeye, 867 steelhead and 612 sea-run cutthroat trout stocks. We assessed the status of anadromous stocks by employing a classification scheme similar to that of Nehlsen et al. (1991). Assessments were possible for 5,487 (57%) of all stocks and included all large, commercially important stocks. The assessments found 624 stocks were at high risk, 78 were at moderate risk, 230 were of special concern, and 142 were extirpated in this century. We were unable to classify 4,172 (43%) of the stocks because of an absence of reliable data. Due to their small size, these stocks are not of great commercial importance, although they are important to the maintenance of salmonid diversity. We also identified many potential threats to anadromous salmon stocks. The absence of systematic, high-quality assessments at the biological stock level precluded reliable assignment of the specific causes for many of the stocks apparently at risk. Nevertheless, habitat degradation associated with logging, urbanization, and hydropower development contributed to most of the 142 documented stock extinctions. Furthermore, there is little doubt that overutilization by commercial and recreational fisheries has in many cases resulted in severe stock depressions that, when added to other factors, has put many stocks at risk.

AB  - Aim We assess whether and how datasets collected by the general public, so-called citizen science programmes, can improve biogeographical studies and contribute to large-scale conservation target-setting. Location Worldwide. Methods We first set a general framework highlighting the prerequisites of a relevant dataset for conservation biogeography. We then illustrate how many different citizen science programmes currently running in different countries can be placed within this framework. Results We highlight that citizen science is particularly useful to address issues spanning large temporal and spatial extents. We then show how datasets based on citizen science can be used to investigate major aspects of global change impacts on biodiversity. We further highlight why these programmes are also particularly valuable in developing the preventative and educational component of conservation biogeography. Main conclusions Conservation biogeography requires considerable amounts of data collected over large spatial and/or temporal extents. Beyond increasing technical advances to collect and analyse these data, citizen science seems to be a highly valuable tool in many aspects. However, while citizen science programmes are now popular and increasingly used in several countries, they are lacking in many others. We argue that the development of citizen science programmes should be encouraged as they can both be highly valuable for conservation biogeography and promote the reconnection between people and nature and more generally between people and science.

AB  - Discussion about local decision making tends to overlook rural and remote youth engagement. Resource extractive industries are, however, fixtures in many rural, remote, northern, and Indigenous communities in settler colonial British Columbia, Canada. These industries shape youths' perceived options for social and economic ventures when they are looking towards their futures. By engaging literature on climate change, settler colonialism, and critical Indigenous studies, and drawing on empirics from workshops conducted with youth from northern British Columbia, this paper explores how rural and remote northern and Indigenous youth engagement and perspectives can transform discussions on climate change and resource extraction. The paper documents how rural and northern youth have been engaged in environmental decision making, particularly in light of resource extraction. The paper also suggests that environmental decision making has at times been extractive itself. The paper concludes that when engaged meaningfully, youth desire to work collectively against social and environmental injustices.

AB  - Most of the hydropower generated in Canada’s western province of British Columbia is generated by a small number of large storage or diversion projects that impound large rivers. All but one were built between 1950 and 1985; a period when environmental considerations for large projects were evolving to present-day social, political and regulatory standards. Large projects result in ecosystem transformations; river valleys are converted to reservoirs, and the release of water for power generation results in highly altered flow regimes downstream of dams. I describe the effects of three projects on aquatic ecosystems and measures that have been taken over the past 60 years to monitor and mitigate those effects, with an emphasis on downstream effects to fish populations. I briefly review methods that were used to predict effects, particularly on key fish species, and consider the role of adaptive management and its alternatives on resolving uncertainties about ecological effects of large hydroelectric projects.

AB  - Collaborative governance arrangements involving a diversity of groups (e.g., governments, civil society, industry) are increasingly being used to make decisions or give advice to decision-makers on water issues. Legitimacy is a critical factor for the effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and popular approval of collaborative efforts. However, as a concept, legitimacy remains contested with various meanings, theoretical backgrounds, and source norms. Clarity is particularly needed around the changing sources of legitimacy as collaborative efforts mature. Drawing on case-study research of five collaborations in British Columbia, Canada, we present a framework of legitimacy sources as collaborations evolve. Legitimacy during the establishment of a collaboration depends principally on community readiness to collaborate, a sense of need, and the perceived potential for goal achievement. As a collaboration continues to grow, its legitimacy forms mainly from normative processes—the perceived quality of factors such as accountability, transparency, consensus-building, and representation of relevant discourses. Once a collaboration reaches maturity and faces questions of its future existence, legitimacy is largely result-based—tangible and contextually meaningful outcomes must be easily identifiable and promoted. Increased understanding of the dynamics of legitimacy can help collaborative efforts strategically plan and work toward their goals as they evolve.

AB  - Evaporative flux is a key component of hydrological budgets. Water loss through evapotranspiration reduces volumes available for run-off. The transition from liquid to water vapour on open water surfaces requires heat. Consequently, evaporation act as a cooling mechanism during summer. Both river discharge and water temperature simulations are thus influenced by the methods used to model evaporation. In this paper, the impact of evapotranspiration estimation methods on simulated discharge is assessed using a semidistributed model on two Canadian watersheds. The impact of evaporation estimation methods on water temperature simulations is also evaluated. Finally, the validity of using the same formulation to simulate both of these processes is verified. Five well-known evapotranspiration models and five evaporation models with different wind functions were tested. Results show a large disparity (18–22% of mean annual total evapotranspiration) among the evapotranspiration methods, leading to important differences in simulated discharge (3–25% of observed discharge). Larger differences result from evaporation estimation methods with mean annual divergences of 34–48%. This translates into a difference in mean summer water temperature of 1–15%. Results also show that the choice of model parameter has less influence than the choice of evapotranspiration method in discharge simulations. However, the parameter values influence thermal simulations in the same order of magnitude as the choice of evaporation estimation method. Overall, the results of this study suggest that evapotranspiration and open water evaporation should be represented separately in a hydrological modelling framework, especially when water temperature simulations are required.

AB  - This article explores the resurgence of Indigenous/Palestine solidarity during the Wet'suwet'en land sovereignty struggle in Canada that took place around the same time Donald Trump's Middle East "peace plan" was released in early 2020. Historicizing this resurgence within a longer period of anti-colonial resistance, the article attends to the distinct historical, political-economic, and juridical formations that undergird settler colonialism in Canada and Israel/Palestine. It contends with the theoretical limits of the settler-colonial framework, pushing back against narratives of settler success, and shows how anti-colonial resistance accelerated economic crises that led both settler states to enter into "negotiations" with the colonized (reconciliation in one case, and peace talks in the other) as a strategy to maintain capitalist settler control over stolen lands. The analysis also sheds light on a praxis of solidarity that has implications for movement building and joint struggle.

AB  - Cities around the world are responding to aging populations and equity concerns for older people by developing age-friendly communities plans, following the World Health Organization's guidelines. Such plans, however, often fail to account for the wide diversity of older people in cities, with the result that some older people, including Indigenous older people, do not see their needs reflected in age-friendly planning and policies. This article reports on a study involving 10 older First Nations and Metis women in the city of Prince George, Canada, comparing the expressed needs of these women with two age-friendly action plans: that of the city of Prince George, and that of the Northern Health Authority. Four main categories were raised in a group discussion and interview with these women at the Prince George Native Friendship Centre: availability of health care services, accessibility and affordability of programs and services, special roles of Indigenous Elders, and experiences of racism and discrimination. There are many areas of synergy between the needs expressed by the women and the two action plans; however, certain key areas are missing from the action plans; in particular, specific strategies for attending to the needs of Indigenous and other older populations who often feel marginalized in health care and in age-friendly planning.

AB  - This article examines the Wet'suwet'en people's struggle for territorial control over their traditional homeland from the normative perspective of collective self-determination. I focus on two interlocking philosophical questions that arise in examination of the case: the justification for a group's right to control territory and the justification for the right of political institutions and officials within those institutions to make and enforce law for the occupants of the territory. I argue that, pursuant to the collective self-determination theory of territorial rights, the legitimate representatives of the Wet'suwet'en people must reflect the people's shared will. After describing the traditional governance system of the Wet'suwet'en people, I argue that there is nothing in principle preventing the hereditary chiefs from reflecting the shared will of the Wet'suwet'en people (as I argue electoral democracy is not always necessary for collective self-determination). I illustrate several reasons why hereditary leaders could reflect the shared will of Wet'suwet'en people better than alternative political authorities, while demonstrating that the political authority of any Wet'suwet'en governance system depends upon the actual endorsement of Wet'suwet'en people themselves.

AB  - Collaborative art is an important kind of "boundary work" in decolonizing relationships to self, others, and land in today's settler societies, or the multinational states that formed as a result of European settler colonialism. This article tells the story of a children's book co-produced by the Cheslatta Carrier Nation in British Columbia and two undergraduate students at the University of Missouri (MU) along with their faculty mentor and his son at the 2018 Cheslatta Camp Out. The Camp Out is a time when the Cheslatta Nation returns to Cheslatta Lake, the homeland from which they were forcibly evacuated in 1952. The process of doing art for the children's book together in place at the Camp Out facilitated the trust and rapport essential for the collaborative creative work, and ultimately helped the participants co-discover the storyline for the book. The co-produced artworks for the children's book (watercolors, photographs, illustrations, stories) became gifts that trace the circuits and complicities of entangled relations. As a gift, artwork brings disparate communities of practice fully into reckoning with place, understood in the Indigenous sense as the relationship of things to each other through land. This is the gift of art, the gift of place.

AB  - This paper describes the results of a non-computational sentiment analysis of the word 'change' on the subject of climate change, local climate innovation and development path change. Results were obtained from interviews conducted with local government officials in 11 communities across British Columbia: Victoria, Vancouver, Prince George, Dawson Creek, North Vancouver, Campbell River, Revelstoke, Surrey, T'Sou-ke First Nation, West Vancouver, and the Kootenay Regional Districts. The sentiment analysis was undertaken to address the lack of agreement among climate researchers and policy-makers over the meaning of change, and to determine whether changes were actually occurring in their development paths. As a result, several drivers and barriers to change were identified at the local government level. Staff quality and horizontal integration were linked to the most positive sentiments, whereas barriers to behavioral change and the limited pace and scale of change were associated with negative sentiments.

AB  - One of the leading features of colonialism is the imposition on a given territory and people a framework for what constitutes authority that renders pre-existing governing practices and legal orders unrecognizable as features of legitimate law and governance. Understood in this way, colonialism renders Indigenous law and governing practices invisible. As a result, decolonization requires changing how authority is apprehended and not only how it is distributed. This article compares two frameworks of authority in relation to the conflict on Wet'suwet'en territory: liberal postcolonial statism and relational pluralism. It shows how each framework provides a distinct lens through which to understand the pertinent features of political authority but argues that relational pluralism presents a better account of how to reconceive political authority in the context of real-world conflict.

AB  - There has been recent controversy over the discrimination between natural and anthropogenic loadings of mercury to lakes. Sediment core profiles have been interpreted as evidence that inputs to lakes have increased. Some investigators have argued, however, that mercury may be sufficiently mobile in sediments to generate profiles that are misinterpreted as historical records. This argument can be tested where the histories of inputs of mercury are known independently from other kinds of information. We have such cases in Canadian lakes and we have been able to assemble sediment core records for comparison with known source histories. Three cases are represented by Clay Lake in Ontario where the source was a chlor-alkali plant with a known history of mercury discharges, Giauque Lake in the Northwest Territories where mercury was used at a gold mine to extract gold from ore, and Stuart Lake in British Columbia where a mercury mine operated for a known period at Pinchi Lake, the lake immediately upstream from Stuart Lake. In these cases lake sediment cores were dated using lead-210 and cesium-137 and then slices were analysed for mercury. The histories of mercury deposition derived from the cores agreed well with the known histories of inputs.

AB  - To determine whether Hg from geologic/mining-related sources at Pinchi Lake (BC, Canada) was causing elevated Hg exposure and/or adversely affecting reproduction in fish-eating birds, breeding bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) on Pinchi Lake and four nearby reference lakes were sampled for blood and feather Hg concentrations and monitored for reproductive success during the summers of 2000, 2001, and 2002. Eggs of red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisgena) also were collected and analyzed. Mercury levels in species at various trophic levels from Pinchi Lake averaged approximately twice those in the same species from nearby lakes combined, even in the absence of substantial new inputs of Hg to Pinchi Lake over several decades. In Pinchi Lake, Hg concentrations in blood and feathers of eagles and eggs of grebes were significantly higher than those in corresponding samples from reference lakes. However, the mean Hg concentration (0.25 mu g/g wet wt) in grebe eggs from Pinchi Lake was substantially lower than accepted threshold levels for reproductive toxicity in most avian species (0.5-1.0 mu g/g wet wt). Mercury concentrations in the blood of adult eagles and their chicks were highly correlated (r = 0.91, p = 0.004). Despite elevated Hg exposure in adult eagles nesting on Pinchi Lake (blood Hg concentration, 4.3-9.4 mu g/ml), birds appeared to be in good body condition, did not differ significantly in terms of weight from eagles nesting on reference takes, and exhibited no evidence of obvious abnormal behavior or lack of coordination. Eagle reproductive success and productivity on Pinchi Lake were not significantly different from those on all reference lakes combined (p = 0.483).

AB  - A bedload movement detector of novel design was installed in a gravel-bed stream as a component of the ongoing research on sediment transport dynamics in the Stuart-Takla Experimental Watersheds in north-central British Columbia, Canada, The device is designed to collect information on the patterns and timing of bedload transport during a flood event. The device is based on a passive magnetic sensor that produces signals of 10(-2) to 10(-5) V as its magnetic field is disturbed by passing clasts. A series of 82 sensors is housed in an aluminum beam placed across the stream, inserted such that its surface is flush with the gravel bed. The device can be raised or lowered to compensate for bed aggradation and scour. A data acquisition system gathers voltage signals from the sensors at rates of 30 to 100 Hz. This device is sensitive enough to record the movement of most volcanic, metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic clasts larger than a few millimetres. O'Ne-ell Creek watershed is a 68 km(2) tributary basin of the Middle River drainage system in the northern headwaters of the Fraser River. Bedload transport generally occurs twice a year in the Stuart-Takla streams: once during spring floods and again during salmon spawning activity. Bedload moved only during two days in 1998, at the peak of the relatively small nival food in May. Nevertheless, the device detected at least 3 x 10(6) passing clasts. A continuous record of bedload transport was obtained, showing a pulsating pattern of activity seemingly independent of stage, lateral movement of the transport zone, and a sudden onset of bed movement with a tapered cessation. We anticipate that more sophisticated calibration of the sensors and accelerated sampling rates will provide detailed information on the size and/or velocity and magnetic permeability of particles moving over the device, and will contribute to a better understanding of bedload transport.

The factors contributing to the preservation and detection of these features are considered, along with their spatial arrangement, and it is argued they are the remains of wood fence and basket trap weirs used to harvest sockeye salmon. The early dates and the fact that these features have survived at all have significant implications for interpretations of the development of the ethnographically described salmon focused cultures of this area, and the network of relationships they developed to compensate for cycles in sockeye abundance. It is argued here that weirs are not a result of recent diffusions, and that there is potential for the remains of similar features to be found in other streams of the region, such that long-term cultural adaptations can be better defined.

AB  - Mean summer water temperatures in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) have increased by similar to 1.5 degrees C since the 1950s. In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture-recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival-temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961-1990) and future (2010-2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9-16% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies.

AB  - Sockeye salmon and kokanee, the anadromous and non-anadromous morphs of Oncorhynchus nerka, spawn in close physical proximity in tributaries to Takla Lake, British Columbia but are reproductively isolated and genetically distinct. Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Takla Lake with average densities ranging from 351–558 fish ha-1 in the north arm to 585–769 fish ha-1 in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71–75%) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species.

AB  - Anadromous and nonanadromous morphs of the Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn in close physical proximity in tributaries to Takla Lake, British Columbia, yet differ in morphology, gill raker number, allozyme allele frequencies, and reproductive traits. Both morphs are semelparous typically maturing at age four, the anadromous morph (sockeye) at fork lengths of 38–65 cm and the nonanadromous morph (kokanee) at 17–22 cm. When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1–0.8% between morphs, 1.7–3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3–5.6% among tributaries for sockeye. We conclude that divergence has occurred in sympatry and examine potential isolating mechanisms.

Les changements climatiques et les ressources en eau dans la Première nation Stellat'en, Colombie-Britannique, Canada : les connaissances issues de la science occidentale et des savoirs traditionnels Le recours aux connaissances issues de la science occidentale et des savoirs traditionnels a permis d'identifier, puis d'aborder les répercussions des changements climatiques sur les ressources en eau dans la Première nation Stellat'en, Colombie-Britannique, Canada. Les données qualitatives obtenues au moyen d'entrevues et d'enquêtes menées auprès de membres de la communauté Stellat'en ont été colligées et comparées à des données de température de l'air, de précipitations et d'hydrométrie recueillies de stations météorologiques et de rivières des environs. Les sages de la communauté ont observé des changements des niveaux d'eau de la rivière ainsi que des variations dans les populations de poissons. Les données quantitatives mettent en évidence une hausse de 2,3 °C de la température de l'air, une augmentation des précipitations de l'ordre de 5 pour cent, et une réduction des chutes de neige de l'ordre de 5 pour cent sur une période de 40 ans. Les résultats qui ressortent de ces analyses ont été présentés au cours de deux ateliers d’échanges sur les savoirs dans la Première nation Stellat'en. Les informations ont ainsi été partagées afin de rendre plus aisées la discussion et la sensibilisation entre les détenteurs de savoirs traditionnels et occidentaux, d'accroître les connaissances sur les opinions de la communauté au sujet des changements climatiques et les ressources en eau, et de fixer des stratégies d'action. L'amélioration des politiques et les actions à l’échelle communautaire et individuelle comptent parmi les recommandations formulées et mises en œuvre par la Première nation Stellat'en.

AB  - A means of determining air emission source regions adversely influencing the city of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada from potential burning of isolated piles of mountain pine beetle-killed lodge pole pine is presented. The analysis uses the CALPUFF atmospheric dispersion model to identify safe burning regions based on atmospheric stability and wind direction. Model results show that the location and extent of influence regions is sensitive to wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric stability and a threshold used to quantify excessive concentrations. A concentration threshold based on the Canada Wide PM2.5 Standard is used to delineate the influence regions while Environment Canada's (EC) daily ventilation index (VI) is used to quantify local atmospheric stability. Results from the analysis, to be used by air quality meteorologists in assessing daily requests for burning permits, are presented as a series of maps delineating acceptable burning locations for sources placed at various distances from the city center and under different ventilation conditions. The results show that no burning should be allowed within 10 km of the city center; under poor ventilation conditions, no burning should be allowed within 20 km of the city center; under good ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed within 10–15 km of the city center; under good to fair ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed beyond 15 km of the city center; and if the wind direction can be reliably forecast, burning can be allowed between 5 and 10 km downwind of the city center under good ventilation conditions.

One such initiative, the Northern Medical Program, has been operating since 2004 in the northern interior of British Columbia, Canada. The NMP’s curriculum relies heavily on the involvement of practicing physicians in its host community, Prince George. Drawing on Bourdieu’s conceptualization of capital in its different forms, the commitment of the local physician community is understood as social capital derived from cultural capital centred on a collective sense of professional identity forged by conditions of practice in an underserviced area. The findings of this study are discussed with respect to the long-term operation and success of community-integrated medical education programs.

AB  - Introduction and Aims.The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods.This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14–30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through χ2-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results.Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00–7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53–4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46–4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21–0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion.MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.[Yang J, Oviedo-Joekes E, Christian KWM, Li K, Louie M, Schechter M, Spittal P.

AB  - To address the critical problem of inadequate physician supply in rural British Columbia, The University of British Columbia (UBC) launched an innovative, expanded and distributed medical program in 2004–2005. Medical students engage in a common curriculum at three geographically distinct sites across B.C.: in Vancouver, Prince George and Victoria. The distribution of the core Histology course required a thorough revision of our instructional methodology. We here report our progress and address the question “How does one successfully distribute Histology teaching to remote sites while maintaining the highest of educational standards?” The experience at UBC points to three specific challenges in developing a distributed Histology curriculum: (i) ensuring equitable student access to high quality histological images, (ii) designing and implementing a reliable, state-of-the-art technological infrastructure that allows for real-time teaching and interactivity across geographically separate sites and (iii) ensuring continued student access to faculty content expertise. High quality images—available through any internet connection—are provided within a new virtual slide box library of 300 light microscopic and 190 electron microscopic images. Our technological needs are met through a robust and reliable videoconference system that allows for live, simultaneous communication of audio/visual materials across the three sites. This system also ensures student access to faculty content expertise during all didactic teaching sessions. Student examination results and surveys demonstrate that the distribution of our Histology curriculum has been successful. Anat Sci Ed 1:95–101, 2008. © 2008 American Association of Anatomists.

AB  - Medical Education 2010:44: 256–262 Context In August 2004, the Northern Medical Program (NMP), a distributed campus of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of British Columbia, Canada, admitted its first students. Situated at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, the NMP created new opportunities, challenges, stresses and changes for the approximately 180 local specialists and family doctors. This study examines the initial impacts of the NMP on doctors practising in its host community. Methods Qualitative interview methods were used. A purposive sample was drawn from: (i) doctors who had involvement with the NMP, and (ii) doctors who were not involved with the NMP. Data were collected from May to September 2007 using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and checked by participants. Analysis involved identifying, coding and categorising key emergent themes until saturation. Results Prior to the implementation of the NMP, doctors in Prince George had formed cohesive networks, in the face of adverse conditions, that functioned effectively as a form of social capital. The introduction of new doctors and resources through the NMP disrupted this sense of community cohesiveness. Over time, however, the NMP has created new mechanisms by which doctors interact and develop partnerships. Discussion The study confirms the value of a social capital framework for understanding a medical community’s adaptation to change. At this early point, it appears the NMP has created new mechanisms by which doctors can interact and develop the partnerships and relationships necessary to renew a sense of community cohesion.

AB  - In early 2019, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) intervened at the Gidimt'en Access Checkpoint in northern British Columbia (BC) and arrested 14 land defenders, garnering global media attention. To explore the ways that settler common sense (Rifkin 2013) is assembled and perpetuated in Canada, this paper examines how Wet'suwet'en mobilization is framed in news media coverage. Situating our work in relation to settler colonial studies and informed by the writings of Indigenous scholars, we use critical discourse analysis to assess mainstream news media framings of the Wet'suwet'en struggle. Drawing from literature on social movement suppression, we discern three main themes in these texts that work to validate the RCMP's excessive use of force against land defenders and delegitimize the Wet'suwet'en's claim to sovereignty. While this framing set the stage for sustained corporate incursions, police surveillance, and occupation across unceded Wet'suwet'en territory, we suggest negative framing as well as activist use of social media to visualize state repression may have created the conditions for what Hess and Martin (2006) call backfire.

AB  - Research has attributed the ‘silent suffering’ of men with depression to the inﬂuences of dominant masculine ideals such as strength and stoicism. Similarly, rural ideals – romanticized notions about rural places – have been shown to mute mental health issues and create barriers to help-seeking. This article examines the experiences of men with depression in Prince George, a northern resourcebased community in British Columbia, Canada. Findings reveal how depressed men and their female partners enacted strategies to positively reinforce men’s gendered sense of self, in a context that otherwise may render them ‘out of place’. While favouring men’s wellbeing, these strategies can also perpetuate an invisible geography of men’s depression.

AB  - Abstract Reconstructed recruitment was compared with the relatively limited set of anthropogenic alterations to the Nechako watercourse to identify and investigate potential causes of recruitment failure of Nechako River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus. Back-calculation of historic recruitment shows that recruitment was present but variable from 1946 until 1964. Subsequent to 1964 there was a rapid decline, principally in 1967, and recruitment failure has continued since that time. Flow regulation, which began in 1952 with the completion of Kenney Dam, preceded recruitment failure by 15 years and therefore flow regulation does not supply a simple unicausal explanation for recruitment failure. We propose that sediment input from an upstream channel avulsion in 1961, in combination with elevated flows in 1964 and 1967, led to alterations to riverbed substrates in critical white sturgeon habitat. Using air photos and specific gauge analysis, we identified a “sediment wave” in the upper Nechako River. The timing and location of avulsion sediments indicates that recruitment failure is most likely due to alteration of main channel substrates rather than the loss of off-channel habitat. Findings are discussed with reference to general hypotheses for recruitment failure in other white sturgeon populations.

AB  - This study investigates the development and application of a simple method to calculate annual and seasonal PM2.5 and PM10 background concentrations in small cities and rural areas. The Low Pollution Sectors and Conditions (LPSC) method is based on existing measured long-term data sets and is designed for locations where particulate matter (PM) monitors are only influenced by local anthropogenic emission sources from particular wind sectors. The LPSC method combines the analysis of measured hourly meteorological data, PM concentrations, and geographical emission source distributions. PM background levels emerge from measured data for specific wind conditions, where air parcel trajectories measured at a monitoring station are assumed to have passed over geographic sectors with negligible local emissions. Seasonal and annual background levels were estimated for two monitoring stations in Prince George, Canada, and the method was also applied to four other small cities (Burns Lake, Houston, Quesnel, Smithers) in northern British Columbia. The analysis showed reasonable background concentrations for both monitoring stations in Prince George, whereas annual PM10 background concentrations at two of the other locations and PM2.5 background concentrations at one other location were implausibly high. For those locations where the LPSC method was successful, annual background levels ranged between 1.8 ± 0.1 µg/m3 and 2.5 ± 0.1 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and between 6.3 ± 0.3 µg/m3 and 8.5 ± 0.3 µg/m3 for PM10. Precipitation effects and patterns of seasonal variability in the estimated background concentrations were detectable for all locations where the method was successful. Overall the method was dependent on the configuration of local geography and sources with respect to the monitoring location, and may fail at some locations and under some conditions. Where applicable, the LPSC method can provide a fast and cost-efficient way to estimate background PM concentrations for small cities in sparsely populated regions like northern British Columbia.

AB  - This study investigates the development and application of a simple method to calculate annual and seasonal PM2.5 and PM10 background concentrations in small cities and rural areas. The Low Pollution Sectors and Conditions (LPSC) method is based on existing measured long-term data sets and is designed for locations where particulate matter (PM) monitors are only influenced by local anthropogenic emission sources from particular wind sectors. The LPSC method combines the analysis of measured hourly meteorological data, PM concentrations, and geographical emission source distributions. PM background levels emerge from measured data for specific wind conditions, where air parcel trajectories measured at a monitoring station are assumed to have passed over geographic sectors with negligible local emissions. Seasonal and annual background levels were estimated for two monitoring stations in Prince George, Canada, and the method was also applied to four other small cities (Burns Lake, Houston, Quesnel, Smithers) in northern British Columbia. The analysis showed reasonable background concentrations for both monitoring stations in Prince George, whereas annual PM10 background concentrations at two of the other locations and PM2.5 background concentrations at one other location were implausibly high. For those locations where the LPSC method was successful, annual background levels ranged between 1.8 ± 0.1 µg/m3 and 2.5 ± 0.1 µg/m3 for PM2.5 and between 6.3 ± 0.3 µg/m3 and 8.5 ± 0.3 µg/m3 for PM10. Precipitation effects and patterns of seasonal variability in the estimated background concentrations were detectable for all locations where the method was successful. Overall the method was dependent on the configuration of local geography and sources with respect to the monitoring location, and may fail at some locations and under some conditions. Where applicable, the LPSC method can provide a fast and cost-efficient way to estimate background PM concentrations for small cities in sparsely populated regions like northern British Columbia.

AB  - Profundal lake sediments are effective sample media for geochemical surveys in the northern Interior Plateau of central British Columbia, where epithermal gold prospects are an important exploration target. The problems posed by sampling of surficial materials for Au analysis are well known, but no field investigations have been made into the most appropriate size of lake sediment samples to collect in this part of the Cordillera. Samples collected with the Hornbrook-type sampler typically weigh 50 to 100 g when dry, and doubling the size of the field samples might be expected to yield more representative and reliable Au concentrations. To test this hypothesis, a comparative study of two field sample sizes was conducted in Clisbako Lake, adjacent to the Clisbako epithermal gold prospect, to ascertain whether or not there are significant differences in Au concentrations with increasing sample size. Clisbako Lake is located about 100 km west of Quesnel in the Fraser Plateau, an area of low to moderate relief and extensive drift cover. Gold occurs in quartz stockwork and silicified breccia zones within a low-sulphidation adularia-sericite epithermal system hosted in Eocene continental volcanics. Two corresponding lake sediment samples were collected at each of 36 sites: a standard sample obtained from a single drop of the sampler, and a second, larger sample obtained by combining sediment from two drops of the sampler. Sediments were dried, disaggregated and pulverized in a ceramic ring mill prior to analysis for Au and additional elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Gold concentrations in the centre of the profundal basin (4–8 ppb) are considerably greater than the regional median of 1 ppb in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Elevated concentrations of Au, As (median: 25.5 ppm) and Sb (median: 3.1 ppm) in lake sediments reflect the geochemistry of adjacent zones of epithermal mineralization and alteration. Median concentrations of 9 ppb Au over the entire lake were obtained for both standard and large-size sample suites, and gold distribution patterns are similar for both sample sizes. Equivalency of population means were tested with a two-sample paired duplicate t-test and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) on 34 sample pairs. Results indicate that there is no significant difference between Au concentrations of the standard and large-size lake sediment samples. There is no evidence to suggest that use of larger, more costly, lake sediment samples are more effective or reliable indicators of epithermal Au mineralization in this region than standard-size samples. The standard samples are satisfactory media for regional and property-scale lake sediment geochemical surveys.

AB  - We have analyzed the methylmercury exposures of native women consuming fish from a reservoir and two lakes in British Columbia. Probability density functions representing methylmercury dose were generated using reasonable distributions for exposure parameters. Sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the impact of alternative parameter values on the exposure estimates. The effect of ignoring variability and uncertainty in exposure was also assessed. Calculated mean daily doses of methylmercury for the target populations were compared to the estimated average dose for the general population. We also determined the percentages of the native women populations with exposures exceeding current guidance values as well as published thresholds for neurological effects. The analysis demonstrates the importance of better characterizing the low dose effects of methylmercury, as the predicted doses fall in the range of recommended maximum daily doses but well below the higher estimates of the effect threshold.

AB  - A serological survey for Brucella abortus antibodies in mature cow moose (Alces alces) was made in an area of northcentral British Columbia which recently had been heavily infected with bovine brucellosis and in which there was considerable intermixing of moose and range cattle. No evidence of Brucella infection was found in the moose tested and it was concluded that they were probably not of great significance in the epidemiology of bovine brucellosis in the study area and were therefore unlikely to have hindered attempts to eradicate brucellosis from the cattle in that area.

AB  - Geographic access to emergency treatment remains an important public policy concern as rural emergency medical systems respond to various pressures to centralize services. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are effective tools to determine what proportion of a given population is adequately served by existing or proposed service distributions. METHODS: This study compares 2 GIS approaches to determining whether recent standards of emergency care access established by the British Columbia Ministry of Health Services are being met in Northern British Columbia. In particular, we compare results obtained using the more commonly used straight-line, or "as the crow flies," method with those obtained using a more sophisticated method that estimates travel time using digitally referenced road network data. RESULTS: Both methods reveal that provincial standards of emergency access are not being met in Northern British Columbia. CONCLUSION: In terms of comparing the 2 approaches, the network technique indicated a lower level of access and was more accurate in identifying populations residing inside and outside the "golden hour" of emergency care.

AB  - The damming of the Nechako River created a huge reservoir to provide hydro power to Alcan's aluminum smelter in Kitimat. Alcan hurriedly flooded the 65 000 ha valley without harvesting any of the 17 million cubic metres of the valley's timber.International Marine Logging recently bid on three tenures to harvest the submerged forest. During the late 1970s and through the 1980s IML salvaged logs from Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island. Since 1990 IML has invested in product testing, feasibility studies and securing financing to seek the Nechako reservoir timber salvaging rights and is now waiting for the government to make timber licence awards.Until recently, the logs and tree stems pulled from the bottom of lakes, reservoirs and waterways were assumed good only for pulp. The Nechako reservoir timber does not have enough fibre strength for the Council of Forest Industries to approve it for use as stress-grade lumber. But Nichols and IML have found a way to circumvent the problem. They extracted a sample of logs from the bottom of Nechako reservoir and shipped them to Oregon for testing. With the help of modern equipment it was discovered that the salvaged timber could be manufactured into veneers that can be used for producing plywood.Forest Renewal B.C. allocated funds to help develop the equipment for the underwater logging operations. Last year the Crown corporation, with an annual budget of $400 million, allocated$350,000 for underwater logging research and development.Bluewater Marine Services Ltd has designed an unmanned submersible which can be operated hydraulically from a barge like an underwater feller-buncher. It fastens itself to the tree while it cuts it down.Developed in Victoria and manufacturedin Vancouver the submersible deviceis expected to be sent to Kinbasket Lakefor testing later this month.The Kinbasket reservoir was flooded in1973. It contains primarily hemlock, cedar, and fir which was flooded by the building of the Mica Dam.

AB  - Damming of large rivers in the U.S. Pacific Northwest and Canada has divided the historical population of white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus into more than 36 fragmented populations, few of which are thriving. We now face the challenge of managing these populations to avoid extirpation. Two goals of this study were to identify extinction thresholds related to small size and inadequate habitat for this species. The minimum viable population size (MVP) is the threshold size above which populations support recruitment and grow and below which populations fail to support recruitment and decline. We estimated a single, cross-population MVP using data from multiple populations and quantile regression, which removed the effects of factors other than population size. Only two populations (those in the Bonneville and Dalles reservoirs on the Columbia River), both with significant increasing trends, were larger than our MVP estimate. We detected significant decreasing trends in two populations—those below Bonneville Dam and in the Kootenai River. To discover how site-specific differences in river habitat influence MVP, we used a population viability analysis (PVA) model that incorporated Allee mechanisms. The PVA model identified a river segment length below which extinction was certain regardless of initial population size. Above this threshold, simulated populations in river segments that were longer or that provided more frequent recruitment opportunities were able to persist with smaller initial sizes. Two priorities emerged for white sturgeon: monitoring age structure and understanding the circumstances preventing recruitment to age 1. Our results ultimately guided us toward thresholds in rearing habitat and age structure that promise to develop into more useful conservation tools than MVP for this and similar long-lived species.

AB  - ABSTRACT It is at the local/community level that the connections among ecosystem health, the health of human communities, and individual livelihoods are most apparent and critical. This paper reports a number of community initiatives aimed at improving or providing alternative livelihoods, while at the same time conserving or restoring the integrity of the ecosystem on which the community depends. It presents case studies of Zimbabwe’s CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) and Akwesasne in northeastern North America, as well as examples from northern Canada, of communities that have attempted to integrate economic development, community values/culture, and the restoration of ecosystem and community health. In both the north and the south these communities face ecological pressures such as climate change, industrial pollution, loss of diversity and productivity, deforestation, and resulting loss of traditional livelihood strategies. They are also victims of global economic forces, economic and institutional globalization, and are struggling to make adaptive responses. Common themes are identified across the case studies and we identify the need for indicators and programs that recognize and reinforce the interconnections and guide development programs that integrate community and ecosystem health and sustainability.

AB  - On first glance, there’s not much in common between 10-ply tires for a diesel-engine, 4 ×4 Super Duty Ford F-350 and a recently released national report entitled “First Peoples, Second Class Treatment.”1 Ask Dr John Pawlovich about the two, however, and you will receive an eloquent answer about transforming the way medicine is delivered to isolated northern First Nations communities, communities with some of the worst health conditions in our country. “I often feel horrified that there are people in this country living in the conditions we still see on reserves. It is shameful that in such a rich country, such disparities persist. Spend a week on a reserve. It will change the way you think.” According to Pawlovich, if there’s any hope for changing a medical system that evidence increasingly documents is neither meeting the needs of indigenous peoples nor substantially lessening the health disparities between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples, physicians have to radically rethink how and where medicine is delivered.....

AB  - The college of New Caledonia (CNC) in Prince George, British Columbia, believes in creating an environment where students can learn leadership skills from the beginning of their professional education. To that end, students, faculty members and administrators of CNC's health sciences and social services division worked together to engage in a campaign called "Expect a Leader." The intention of this campaign was to strengthen interdisciplinary awareness between programs and to introduce leadership qualities to future healthcare professionals. This article demonstrates how this initiative created change within six health science programs and across an entire division. The authors represent a cross-disciplinary team of health professionals: former CNC students, faculty members and the administrator. This team came together to discuss leadership strategies and activities that occurred within the educational setting and in the community during the Expect a Leader campaign. The authors anticipate that the campaign will foster students' involvement in interdisciplinary leadership activities within practice settings. Readers of this article will learn about the positive effects of promoting interdisciplinary leadership campaigns across healthcare disciplines, and will gain an understanding of reasons for nurturing leadership from the beginning of the students' education.

This analysis of documents produced and shared by organizers of Freedom Train 2012 maps modes of mobilizing participation across media spaces. Drawing upon alternative media literature, this article proposes a turn from analyzing how protest movements use media tools to how protest movements can be understood as forms of alternative media. The article concludes by advocating further study of alternative media practices to attend to how traditionally marginalized voices and cross-community communication networks contest industrial, governmental, and mainstream media power.

AB  - In the northern interior of BC, the town of Smithers' new garbage collection bylaw will make it illegal as of January 1, 2001, to put any product stewardship items, such as used beverage containers and old paint, into the local landfill. The bylaw also bans old corrugated cardboard, grass clippings, leaves and clean wood waste. The bylaw includes a new and visionary definition of garbage as "any material that has no economic value to a local enterprise."Farrow adds, though, that this strategy would be much more effective if the regional government would impose tipping fees at the landfill. Unlike many regional governments for rural Canadian communities, the regional district of Bulkley-Nechako doesn't charge fees to dump at its landfill. "Without the tipping fees we have no financial incentive to reduce waste, even though we recognize our social and environmental responsibility to do so. We could easily reduce our annual expenditure on waste disposal costs by one quarter if there were tipping fees ... and that would free up money for recycling and education initiatives."Our "take, make and waste" economy will pose challenges for R-CED. The prevailing wisdom remains to throw things "away" and many manufacturers are happy with the status quo, which dumps the responsibility for waste management on taxpayers.

AB  - This study quantifies the contribution of atmospheric rivers (ARs) to annual and extreme river runoff and evaluates the relationships between watershed characteristics and AR-related maximum river runoff across British Columbia and southeastern Alaska (BCSAK). Datasets used include gauged runoff from 168 unregulated watersheds, topographic characteristics of those watersheds, a regional AR catalog, and integrated vapor transport fields for water years (WYs) 1979–2016. ARs contribute ~22% of annual river runoff along the Coast and Insular Mountains watersheds, which decreases inland to ~11% in the watersheds of the Interior Mountains and Plateau. Average association between ARs and annual maximum river runoff attains >80%, >50%, and <50% along the watersheds of the western flanks of the Coast Mountains, the Interior Mountains, and Interior Plateau, respectively. There is no significant change in AR-related extreme annual maximum runoff across BCSAK during 1979–2016. AR conditions occur during 25 out of 32 of the flood-related natural disasters in British Columbia during WYs 1979–2016. AR-related annual maximum runoff magnitude is significantly higher than non-AR-related annual maximum runoff for 30% of the watersheds studied. Smaller and steeper watersheds closer to the coast are more susceptible to AR-related annual maximum runoff than their inland counterparts. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity as a major control for the distribution of peak runoff in BCSAK. This work provides insights on the hydrological response of watersheds of northwestern North America to landfalling ARs that may improve flood risk assessment and disaster management in this region.

AB  - Chlorophyll a (Chl a) seasonality was investigated in four shallow eutrophic lakes located in north-central British Columbia (western Canada). Chlorophyll a concentration maxima in all four lakes occurred during the late summer/early autumn when near-surface total phosphorus ([Tot-P]) and total dissolved P concentrations, pH, and water temperature were highest. Mass balance and inferential analyses showed that bloom-triggering P loads came mostly from within-lake sources, but that mechanisms controlling internal loading in Charlie and Tabor (lakes having hypolimnetic oxygen deficits during summer) were fundamentally different than those in Nulki and Tachick (isothermal, well oxygenated lakes). Although the timing and intensity of major blooms were associated with late summer/early autumn P loads, average summer [Chl a] were predicted well by previously developed models based solely on spring overturn [Tot-P]. Instantaneous within-lake [Chl a] were best predicted by models incorporating both surface [Tot-P] and temperature (r2 = 0.57–0.70). Moreover, [Tot-P] and temperature combined accounted for 57% of among-lake variations in instantaneous [Chl a]: log [Chl a] = 0.038 (°C) + 0.006 ([Tot-P]) + 0.203 (P < 0.001), where [Chl a] and [Tot-P] are in μg l−1. Positive associations between instantaneous [Chl a] and temperature support climate change models that forecast changes in phytoplankton productivity even if nutrient loading rates remain constant.

AB  - In central British Columbia, ice flow during the late Wisconsinan Fraser glaciation (ca. 25–10 ka) occurred in three phases. The ice expansion phase occurred during an extended period when glaciers flowed westward to the Pacific Ocean and east-southeastward onto the Nechako Plateau from ice centers in the Skeena, Hazelton, Coast, and Omineca Mountains. Initially, glacier flow was confined by topography along major valleys, but eventually piedmont and montane glaciers coalesced to form an integrated glacier system, the Cordilleran ice sheet. In the maximum phase, a Cordilleran ice divide developed over the Nechako Plateau to 300 km inland from the Pacific coast. At this time, the surface of the ice sheet extended well above 2500 m above sea level, and flowed westward over the Skeena, Hazelton, and Coast Mountains onto the continental shelf, and eastward across the Rocky Mountains into Alberta. In the late glacial phase, a rapid rise of the equilibrium line caused ice lobes to stagnate in valleys, and restricted accumulation centers to high mountains.Discordant directions in ice flow are attributed to fluctuations of the ice divide representing changes in the location of accumulation centers and ice thickness. Ice centers probably shifted in response to climate, irregular growth in the ice sheet, rapid calving, ice streaming, and drainage of proglacial and subglacial water bodies. Crosscutting ice-flow indicators and preservation of early (valley parallel) flow features in areas exposed to later (cross-valley) glacier erosion indicate that the ice expansion phase was the most erosive and protracted event.

AB  - New bedrock mapping completed as part of the Nechako NATMAP Project indicates that the area between Babine and Takla lakes in central British Columbia is underlain by rocks of the Early Permian Asitka, Late Triassic Takla, and Early to Middle Jurassic Hazelton volcanic-arc assemblages of the Stikine Terrane. These are cut by large composite stocks of quartz diorite, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite previously mapped as the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Topley intrusions. New U/Pb (n = 6) and laser 40Ar/39Ar (n = 10) isotopic age dates reported in this paper suggest there are two distinct ages of plutons: the Topley intrusive suite with isotopic ages between 218 and 193 Ma; and, east of Babine Lake, the new Spike Peak intrusive suite with isotopic ages ranging from 179 to 166 Ma. West of the main plutonic belt is a thick volcanic succession of subaerial, porphyritic andesite flows, volcanic breccias, and rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs that have isotopic ages between 185 and 174 Ma. These rocks are assigned t..., Une nouvelle cartographie effectuée dans le cadre du projet NATMAP Nechako indique que la région entre les lacs Babine et Takla au centre de la Colombie-Britannique est recouverte de roches des assemblages d'arcs volcaniques du terrane de Stikine, soit Asitka du Permien précoce, Takla du Trias tardif et Hazelton du Jurassique précoce à moyen. Ces assemblages sont recoupés par des petits massifs intrusifs composites de diorite quartzique, de granodiorite et de monzonite quartzique qui avaient auparavant été cartographiés en tant que les intrusions Topley, du Trias tardif au Jurassique précoce. De nouvelles datations U-Pb (n = 6) et isotopes laser 40Ar/39Ar (n = 10) présentées dans cet article suggèrent deux âges distincts de plutons, soit la suite intrusive de Topley avec des âges isotopiques entre 218 et 193 Ma et, à l'est du lac Babine, la nouvelle suite intrusive de Spike Peak dont les âges isotopiques varient de 179 à 166 Ma.

AB  - Background: Policing has profound health implications for people who use illicit drugs. Among Aboriginal communities, distrust of police is common, due partly to legacies of colonial policing. In response to the paucity of research among Aboriginal people who use drugs, this paper aims to: (1) Describe the policing experiences of young Aboriginal people who use drugs; (2) Identify policing activities associated with unsafe injection practices; and (3) Elucidate barriers to positive police relations.Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. This mixed-methods study (N = 372) used period prevalence from 2007 to 2010 to describe policing experiences, mixed effects regression models to identify correlates of policing activities, and thematic qualitative analysis to assess attitudes to police relations.Results: Many participants were stopped by police (73%), experienced physical force by police (28%), had drug equipment conﬁscated (31%), and changed location of drug use because of police (43%). Participants who reported dealing drugs (40%) were signiﬁcantly more likely to experience police engagement. Among participants in Prince George, 4% reported to have had non-consensual sex with members of the criminal justice system. Policing activity was signiﬁcantly associated with syringe sharing, rushed injection, and reused syringe. Due to personal experience, practical concerns, and intergenerational legacies of unfair policing practices, most participants did not want a positive relationship with police (57%). Desire for a positive relationship with police was directly associated with being helped by police, and inversely associated with being stopped by police and experiencing physical force by police.Conclusion: Policing activities may be impacting the well-being of Aboriginal people who use drugs. Due to focused prosecution of street-level drug dealing, some police may favor enforcement over harm reduction. Positive police engagement and less aggressive policing may enhance perceptions of police among young Aboriginal people who use drugs.

AB  - Erosion along the Nechako Reservoir and Cheslatta River Spillway has resulted in unusually well-exposed late Quaternary and Holocene stratigraphy. Surficial sediments in the study area are mostly products of Late Wisconsinan glaciation. However, evidence for pre-Late Wisconsinan sedimentation has been found along the shores of the Nechako Reservoir, including till of an older glaciation and organic-bearing, blue-grey, lacustrine sediments of probable Middle Wisconsinan age. Stratigraphic correlation of the lake sediments suggests that an extensive lake system occurred in the region during the Olympia Nonglacial Interval. Late Wisconsinan ice initially moved along major valleys, with glaciofluvial outwash deposited in front of the advancing ice. Advance-phase glaciolacustrine sediments are rare but significant, as slope failures are spatially associated with areas where they are preserved. The distribution of these sediments and associated deltaic deposits indicates that advance-phase glacial lakes occurre..., De l'érosion le long du réservoir Nechako et du déversoir de la rivière Cheslatta a produit de très beaux affleurements de la stratigraphie du Quaternaire tardif et de l'Holocène. Les sédiments de surface dans la région à l'étude sont surtout des produits de la glaciation du Wisconsinien tardif. Toutefois, des preuves de sédimentation au pré-Wisconsinien tardif ont été retrouvées le long des berges du réservoir Nechako; elles comprennent un till d'une glaciation plus ancienne et des sédiments lacustres gris-bleu contenant de la matière organique, datant probablement du Wisconsinien moyen. La corrélation stratigraphique des sédiments lacustres suggère qu'un système extensif de lacs était en place dans la région durant l'intervalle non glaciaire Olympia. La glace du Wisconsinien tardif a tout d'abord avancé le long des vallées majeures alors que du matériel stratifié fluvio-glaciaire était déposé en avant de la glace qui avançait. Des sédiments glacio-lacustres de phase avancée sont rares mais importants ca...

AB  - Approximately 50% of the Nechako River's flow was permanently diverted into another watershed in the early 1950s. Up to 50% of the remaining flow may be diverted in the future. To give insight as to how future and past flow reductions will/have affect(ed) macrophyte abundance, we first developed equations relating average summer channel speed to cross-sectional biomass and bottom cover from data collected at 26 sites. The average summer channel speed at each site was then estimated assuming flows (at Fort Fraser) of 408 m(3).s(-1) (natural), 165 m(3).s(-1) (1952-1990 average), and two future scenarios: 120 and 60 m(3).s(-1). We then used these estimates in our equations to compute abundance under the various flow regimes. Our models suggest that flow has Little influence on macrophyte abundance in two fast-flowing reaches, which together account for 50% of the river's length. In contrast, the diversion was predicted to have increased biomass and cover by, on average, 66 g.m(-2) and 15%, respectively, in a slow-flowing reach accounting for 20% of the river's length. Biomass and cover in this reach could increase by an additional 65 g.m(-2) (or 240 g.m(-2)) and 9% (or 29%) if flows are reduced to 120 m(3).s(-1) (or 60 m(3).s(-1)).

AB  - Background: COVID-19 was declared a global emergency in the first quarter of 2020. It is has resulted in and continues in over a million deaths worldwide and halted medical systems and particularly elective surgeries worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the initial COVID-19 pandemic months on orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia. Methods: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. Results: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of > 15% (range 0–100%). Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancellation of surgeries has created an increased backlog of 32,400 orthopaedic surgeries in British Columbia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the implementation of telemedicine, which will be a long-lasting benefit in providing healthcare. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Quaternary stratigraphy of the Babine Lake region is characterized by a Late Wisconsinan succession of advance-phase glaciolacustrine sediments, glaciofluvial deposits, and till. Pollen data from a rare new interglacial site suggest a colder than present Middle Wisconsinan climate. Ice flow during the last glaciation was dominantly southeasterly, but in the Babine Range a regional, westerly ice-flow event occurred. Evidence for westerly flow diminishes eastward of Babine Lake, suggesting that the valley was near the eastward limit of an interior ice divide. Deglacial sediments include ice-marginal debris-flow, glaciofluvial, and glaciolacustrine sediments. Raised-delta elevations indicate that Glacial Lake Babine extended nearly 150 m above present lake level to 850 m asl, and higher, earlier phases may have existed locally. A variety of Holocene deposits cap the Quaternary succession. Glaciation has important implications for exploration in this copper-producing area. Southeasterly glacial dispersal patterns dominate, despite a regionally complex ice-flow history. Highly anomalous concentrations of copper occur in tills down-ice of most known bedrock copper occurrences, and a number of similarly anomalous till sites with no known copper sources have been identified in drift-covered areas. Exploration problems due to the thick and complex surficial cover can be overcome by selective sampling of basal tills, the composition of which clearly reflects the presence of buried mineral deposits. The effectiveness of till geochemistry as a method for locating buried mineralization in the region will be enhanced by careful selection of sample media and by a clear understanding of the glacial history.

AB  - The Wet'suwet'en are currently struggling to affirm their Aboriginal and territorial rights through the British Columbia treaty process. While this process continues, resource extraction activities remove large volumes of culturally important resources. At present, very few areas of the their territory have not been impacted by logging or mining development. Understandably, the Wet'suwet'en feel a sense of urgency regarding the conservation and protection of their natural and cultural resources. This paper examines how the Wet'suwet'en adapted the existing archaeological process within the resource management industry to better reflect their vision and cultural values. The creation of non-legislated policy and protocol agreements with various industry and government entities, combined with the Wet'suwet'en Territorial Stewardship Plan (WTSP), has allowed this First Nation to centrally position themselves in the archaeological process, which did not adequately address their needs. The primary result has been greater Wet'suwet'en involvement in decisions made regarding the management of their cultural resources.

AB  - While stakeholder involvement in environmental management is now common, we suggest that stakeholders can contribute to a pluralistic civic science that incorporates local knowledge directly into environmental decision making and research. We consider how insights from feminist scholarship might help us to understand the influence of power relations among our subjects of study and in determining how scientific knowledge is defined and used. We pay particular attention to how knowledge is produced, how participation is constrained, and to what extent community participants and researchers would benefit from critical reflection in their work. We apply these elements to an assessment of a community forestry pilot project in Burns Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Our findings suggest that while local participants have considered community forestry effective, practices have not met the ideals of a pluralistic civic science. We identify some of the reasons for this discrepancy and provide suggestions for future practice.

AB  - Guided by feminist and community-based participatory methodologies and by efforts to decolonize health research practices, and undertaken with qualitative research methods (interviews, open-ended questionnaires, and analysis of arts-based expressions like storytelling, joumaling, and picture-making), this research identified challenges and barriers that (predominantly Aboriginal) women in northern British Columbia faced when trying to access sexual health care services related to HPV and cervical cancer screening. The research also examined the possible effectiveness of creative or arts-based strategies to promote cervical health and screening awareness among young and/or traditionally underserved or marginalized women. We review findings from data gathered over six months during multiple interactions with 22 women from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Results confirm that ethnicity, finances, and formal education are determinants in women's awareness about, access to, and use of cervical screening services, and that experiences of gendered victimization, feelings of disempowerment, and life circumstances all influenced women's comfort levels with, access to, and use of cervical cancer screening services.

AB  - The Yinka Dene Alliance is a coalition of six First Nations in British Columbia. This Alliance has engaged a form of resistance to the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline articulated in such manifestos as the Save the Fraser Declaration. This Declaration (endorsed by over 130 First Nations in western Canada) brings to the fore the authority of the nations of the Yinka Dene Alliance, authority possessed as Indigenous nations and expressed in the form of pronouncements about what they consider to be against their Indigenous laws. The middle sections of this paper contain an exploration into how the Indigenous authority grounding these expressions of Indigenous law would likely be treated by Canadian law. The intent is to show just how antagonistic the Canadian legal apparatus is to such forms of resistance. Illustration of the depth and nature of the hostility leads into questions about why this might be so. Reflections on what seems to fuel an absolute denial of Indigenous authority show not only how challenging it will be to make headway but also the great promise held out by resistance founded on such authority. This promise is not only for Aboriginal peoples in Canada (as they struggle to protect their lands and cultures), but for citizens of the world in search of grounds of authority that might stand up in the face of powerful forces seemingly intent on short-term wealth maximization based on unsustainable resource exploitation.

AB  - While environmental rights have largely been situated within the public law arena of statutes and constitutions, tort law is an important complementary tool for protecting environmental entitlements. Aboriginal peoples face systemic barriers to accessing the environmental protection provided by tort law, in particular the law of nuisance. This Article argues for an application of tort law that is sensitive to the formal and substantive equality rights of Aboriginal peoples in the area of environmental protection. Through an examination of Thomas v. Rio Tinto as a case study in Aboriginal environmental rights in tort, the authors demonstrate that tort law can and should be responsive to the unique property interests and legal perspectives of Aboriginal peoples.

AB  - White sturgeon ( Acipenser transmontanus) in the Fraser River are listed as imperiled ( the second highest possible rating) by the British Columbia Conservation Data Centre. A difficulty in trying to protect this species in the Fraser River and elsewhere is the lack of knowledge regarding their population biology. Variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region and at four microsatellite loci was examined in order to characterize white sturgeon samples from throughout the Fraser River mainstem and from a major tributary, the Nechako River. Samples from the adjacent Columbia River were analyzed for comparison. In contrast to previous work, present data indicate that white sturgeon population structure in this region reflects post-glacial dispersal more than it does recent anthropogenic effects. The data divided the Fraser into four biogeographic regions: ( i) the lower Fraser, below Hell's Gate; ( ii) the middle Fraser, between Hell's Gate and river km 553; (iii) the upper Fraser, above the Nechako confluence; and ( iv) the Nechako River. These four groups are concordant with those suggested by tag and recapture and catch per unit effort data, and are separated by what have been identified as barriers to white sturgeon migration. Based on concordance between these different types of data, it is argued that the four groups identified here merit evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) status.

AB  - David Douglas was the first to specialize in the botany of the North-west, and systematically comb the territory for specimens. Making his headquarters at Fort Vancouver, in the State of Washington, he travelled up and down the Columbia by canoe or on foot, sometimes with an Indian guide, sometimes with the Hudson’s Bay Company’s men, but often alone with his dog. Difficult and exhausting as were his journeys, he was happy in the rich harvest of plants which he obtained. His expectations were fully realized. During the six months following his arrival in the country he collected about 500 different specimens (499 to be exact), obtaining as far as possible from 12 to 24 samples of each specimen. Little escaped the keen observation of the young student of natural history. His attention was not confined to vegetation; specimens of birds, insects, and animals were also obtained. After two years’ painstaking labour in the Columbia River region from 1825 to 1827, and a very hard journey south towards California to find the sugar pine he returned to England. After a two years’ sojourn in England, during which he was feted and lionized for his botanical discoveries, he came back to Western America in 1830. This time he came trained and equipped for doing work quite different from that formerly undertaken, having added the taking of geographical and astronomical observations to his former pursuits. Leaving Fort Vancouver March 20, 1833, he travelled with the express as far as Fort Okanagan. Douglas also undertook the making of field-sketches along the route and did a continuous series of the country travelled from Fort Okanagan to the Quesnel River, showing the natural configuration, with notes on trees, vegetation, and soil. Leaving Fort Kamloops the brigade went on to Fort Alexandria, where the horses were changed for boats. The journey was also up-stream on the Nechako and Stuart rivers. Douglas went up the Nechako to Fort Fraser, on Fraser Lake, and probably went overland from there to Fort St. James. After a very brief stay at Fort St. James, during which he took some observations, he and Johnson embarked in a small birch-bark canoe and descended the Stuart and Nechako rivers. At Fort George they stayed a day or two with George Linton, clerk in charge there, and then began descending the Fraser. And now disaster was added to disappointment. On June 13, at the “Stony Islands,” as he called them, they were wrecked in the rapids; the canoe was smashed to pieces. Douglas was carried down the rapids and into the whirlpool below, and he was swept about in the turbulent waters for an hour and forty minutes, before being washed on to the rocky shore. He lost everything he had except his instruments, his astronomical journal, notes and charts, and his barometrical observations. The last months of Douglas’s life were spent in the Sandwich Islands. He arrived in Honolulu in December, 1833, and spent the next few months in exploring the island of Hawaii. He collected a large number of ferns. The two great volcanic peaks attracted him and he climbed both, being the first white man to do so. As usual, he endured terrible hardships. In August, 1834, while crossing the island alone with his dog he fell into a pit used for trapping wild cattle, and was gored to death. Some say he was pushed in, and in this way murdered for his money. Whichever it was, it was a horrible death, and an untimely one, for he was only 34 years old. As the pioneer botanist of North-west America and California, Douglas made their flora known to the world. The number of plants which he introduced to England in the form of root, seed, or cutting is remarkable. Other collectors have contributed more to botanical knowledge or made more extensive collections, but none has contributed more to our stock of beautiful and hardy plants than he.

AB  - This study of family practitioners as anesthetists is based on data extracted from records of the Medical Services Plan of British Columbia. During the period from 1976 to 1986, the proportion of anesthetics that were administered by non-certified anesthetists declined from 28.3% to 22.1% of the total number. Small and medium-sized hospitals continue to depend on family-physician anesthetists. Family practitioners make up 96.9% of all anesthetists practising in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds and 88.2% of anesthetists in hospitals with 50-99 beds. Rural areas are served almost exclusively by family-practice anesthetists, since 16 of 29 B.C. regional districts have one or no certified anesthetists. The author discusses the implications of this situation for the future of family-practice anesthesia.

AB  - One of the board's key deliverables in its five-year mandate was a strategic plan for sustainability of the Fraser Basin. This plan, named the Charter for Sustainability of the Fraser Basin, was published on 27 February 1997 (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). The Charter is a prescription developed by, and for, the people who live, work, and play in the Fraser Basin. The Charter was developed based on the work of government and nongovernment agencies, committees, and individuals working together throughout the Fraser Basin. Here are some of the key elements of the Charter. The operational arm of the Fraser Basin Council Society is its Council. The Council is the custodian of the basin Charter for Sustainability (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). The Council is unique. Normally, organizations are constructed on adversarial lines. However, the Fraser Basin Council is not, and represents a new approach to doing business which cuts across adversarial lines and other differences in an effort to promote the common social good. It is a nongovernmental organization informed by governments. Governments are part of the council's management structure but it is "arm's length" from governments. It is a not-for-profit, fee-for-service, entity that can, for the first time, legally meld public sector funding with private sector participation. Although the Council is presently funded through equal contributions from the federal, provincial, and local governments, it is empowered to raise funds in many forms: bequests, legacies, property, or other in-kind gifts to augment Council operations. The Fraser Basin Charter for Sustainability is one of the final documents developed by the Fraser Basin Management Board (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). It is a broadly worded document which lays out a vision, principles, goals, and broad strategies for achieving sustainability of the Fraser Basin. Individuals, businesses, community and environmental groups, and governments are invited to promote the Charter and work together to support its implementation. The Fraser Basin Council will be responsible for updating the Charter and encouraging the application of its values and principles.

AB  - The Nechako River originally drained a network of spectacular wilderness streams and lakes. Few knew this area, other than the Cheslatta T'en First Nations community and some tourists, farmers and ranchers. Alcan arrived in 1950, lured by the promise of cheap electricity (required in vast quantities for aluminum smelting) and provincial subsidies. In return for Alcan's investment in a dam, power plant and smelter, the Industrial Development Act of 1949 provided tax exemptions, considerable autonomy, and control over much of the forests and waters of the region. In 1979 Alcan announced plans to expand electrical production at Kemano. A 1987 agreement, negotiated secretly with the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, gave it permission to divert more of the Nechako, reducing its flow to about 12 percent of the pre - 1950 amount. The agreement also contained conditions intended to ensure protection of salmon stocks. But even as Alcan began construction in 1988, opposition was increasing among residents of the Nechako Valley, led by the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and the Rivers Defense Coalition. Eventually, this opposition spread throughout the province, and captured considerable media attention. The controversy culminated in a public review by the BC Utilities Commission, and subsequently, [Mike Harcourt]'s announcement in January 1995.

AB  - The recent global commodities price boom prompted a significant growth in mineral exploration projects in British Columbia (BC). These now face the impacts of the recession in the global economy. The forests in BC where many of these projects are underway is also facing a massive, climate-change related, pine beetle infestation which along with the housing slowdown in North America is causing a collapse of the region’s forestry industry. Mining development could create new jobs through economic development, reducing the exodus of skilled workers and nurturing the already fragile state of many rural communities, including First Nations. Recent issues over new BC mining projects and their impacts on surrounding communities prompt consideration of an approach to project planning that goes beyond simply aiming to mitigate environmental and social impacts. The opportunity exists to involve the participation of communities early in the planning process and to place greater consideration on the contribution of a project to building social capital in these mining communities. There is also the possibility to consider the role of a particular project in a more strategic sense, as part of regional development planning that deals with wider issues, time spans and synergies relating to socio-economic development in mining communities. This article stems from early research into the characterisa- tion of social capital and the use of community-indicators to forecast specific social and economic outcomes for new mining projects. The overall objective is to evaluate an approach to mine planning that potentially takes greater account of opportunities to enhance community health and resilience. Reference is made to a current mining project in north-central BC, characteristic of the complex socio- economic setting of contemporary mining developments in BC.

AB  - Since the mid-19th century Carrier Sekani nations have been undergoing changes that have weakened, but not destroyed, the basis for self-government. This paper examines the historical origins of traditional Carrier Sekani self-government and the events through which traditional self-government was undermined. It also examines landscape changes that have occurred in Carrier Sekani territory since the arrival of non-aborigi- nal settlers, and the impacts of these changes on Carrier Sekani communities. It is asserted that the roots of tradi- tional self-government have remained intact, though on an informal level. The basis for re-asserting control by Carrier Sekani nations over their lands and resources is a shared concern over traditional territories and resources. This is reflected in the priorities of Carrier Sekani communities in the treaty-making process.

AB  - Pine cambium is a food resource that was regularly utilized by foraging populations of the interior of British Columbia from at least AD 1790 to 1950. The scars left on living pine trees (Culturally Modified Trees, or CMTs) by cambium stripping are directly datable evidence for this subsistence activity by utilizing forestry increment borers to extract cores. Further, pine cambium is generally regarded as a marginal, or supplementary resource, with changes in the frequency of cambium collection being related to natural cycles in the abundance of staple resources. This paper discusses the dating of these subsistence features, and in comparing two areas of the Nechako River drainage of British Columbia, suggests that pine cambium was more intensively utilized in areas lacking salmon, the staple of the greater region.

AB  - This study examines the 1911–2010 variability and trends in annual streamflow at 139 sites across the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada. The Fraser River is the largest Canadian waterway flowing to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the world’s greatest salmon rivers. Our analyses reveal high runoff rates and low interannual variability in alpine and coastal rivers, and low runoff rates and high interannual variability in most streams in BC’s interior. The interannual variability in streamflow is also low in rivers such as the Adams, Chilko, Quesnel and Stuart where the principal salmon runs of the Fraser River occur. A trend analysis shows a spatially coherent signal with increasing interannual variability in streamflow across the FRB in recent decades, most notably in spring and summer. The upward trend in the coefficient of variation in annual runoff coincides with a period of near-normal annual runoff for the Fraser River at Hope. The interannual variability in streamflow is greater in regulated rather than natural systems; however, it is unclear whether it is predominantly flow regulation that leads to these observed differences. Environmental changes such as rising air temperatures, more frequent polarity changes in large-scale climate teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and retreating glaciers may be contributing to the greater range in annual runoff fluctuations across the FRB. This has implications for ecological processes throughout the basin, for example affecting migrating and spawning salmon, a keystone species vital to First Nations communities as well as to commercial and recreational fisheries. To exemplify this linkage between variable flows and biological responses, the unusual FRB runoff anomalies observed in 2010 are discussed in the context of that year’s sockeye salmon run. As the climate continues to warm, greater variability in annual streamflow, and hence in hydrological extremes, may influence ecological processes and human usage throughout the FRB in the 21st century.

AB  - Hydroelectric development, forest exploitation, agricultural land use and related human population numbers have increased rapidly during the last 40 years, in the basin of the Nechako River, a major tributary system of the Fraser River. The Kemano project of the Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd. begun in 1950, was the largest industrial scheme in the area. A key feature of the first stage of it was a dam which diverted about 40% of flow of the south branch of the Nechako River, through a tunnel in the mountains, to the Pacific Ocean. In 1987 an agreement for the Kemano Completion Project (KCP), which would have diverted 87% of the flow, was signed. This final phase of the project would have put important fisheries resources of the upper Fraser River at high risk. Mitigation for fisheries protection were inadequate or untested in the system at the time. Potential cumulative impacts of water abstraction, elevated pollution levels, increased water temperature and natural sediment were not addressed. In January 1995 KCP was cancelled but there remain at present no adequate measures to protect the fish and the river ecosystem. These measures are to be negotiated in the future. Future management of the whole Kemano development must provide biologically realistic flow and temperature regimes in the Nechako River, and must deal with cumulative impacts of population and industrial growth. To achieve ‘sustainability’ of fisheries in the Nechako River and upper Fraser watershed the present approach to the Kemano development must be changed fundamentally. The future of the Kemano development must be set in the context of the whole future of the upper Fraser system. Continued growth and development, as has occurred in the upper Fraser and total basin, can not go on without inimical changes to ecosystem conditions and loss of fisheries resources.

AB  - Concerns about living conditions on First Nations1 reserves are attracting a great deal of attention from public health practitioners and researchers looking to design and implement measures to improve and promote health. Issues related to geographic isolation, low socioeconomic status, and threats to traditional practices are known to contribute to poor health outcomes, especially amongst Aboriginal youth. Research and educational programs are needed to address these challenges yet even the most state-of-the art initiatives are destined to fail if they are perceived to be disrespectful of, and insensitive to, local First Nations' culture and ways of knowing. Inspired by Smith's call for decolonized methodologies, we develop the concept of appropriate engagement as a framework for working with First Nations. A case study of research and a nutrition program conducted in Takla Landing, British Columbia are presented to offer an outline of appropriate engagement and how it can be used to better inform public health initiatives aimed at improving the dietary practices of First Nations populations.

AB  - The susceptibility of the Prince George airshed to incidence of high concentrations of particulate matter < 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) has raised considerable concern because of potentia I health hazards. This study examined the utility of chemical and morphological characteristics of PM10 collected and archived by the BC Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks from three monitoring stations to determine the possible sources of PM10 during selected episodic and non-episodic events. Samples from three episodic events (24 h PM10 levels > 50 mug m(-3)) and three non-episodic events (24 h PM10 levels < 50 mug m(-3)) in 1995-1996 were examined using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive system. Results show that rounded. spherical and oval shaped particulate were diagnostic for combustion sources, while irregular-shaped particulate were dominant in all samples including road dust. The particulate size distributions indicated that combustion sources contributed more to < 2.5 mum fraction while geologic material is responsible for particulate with diameter between 3 and 4 mum. Principal component analysis of in situ chemical composition suggests that high concentrations of aluminum, silicon and magnesium are indicative of geologic material while carbon. sodium and sulphur are indicative or combustion and industrial sources. Our study suggests that in Prince George. episodic events were influenced by geologic material while the non-episodic events are impacted by industrial, combustion and to some extent by geologic materials. We also found that the combined use of particulate morphology and elemental composition has a good potential to distinguish between geologic material and industrial, combustion sources of PM10 in the Prince George airshed.

AB  - A large number of groups in British Columbia and Canada as a whole have expended considerable effort to define sustainable development goals and, to a lesser extent, select sustainable development indicators. Many hope that collection and monitoring of such indicators will provide important policy guidance to decision-makers and provide a means for tracking sustainable development. This project was designed with the following goals: (i) to select indicators that could be linked to an operational definition for sustainable development within the Fraser River Basin (British Columbia); (ii) to assess the accessibility, quality and relevance of the best available data for developing such indicators; (iii) to apply modeling techniques for discerning the linkages among indicators; and (iv) to provide recommendations for further indicator selection and modeling research. The major methodological conclusions reached were: (i) it is important to link sustainable development goals to movements of a small slate of individual indicators as single indicators can rarely be linked to any specific sustainable development goal; (ii) the poor quality, inaccessibility and irrelevance of existing data are pervasive constraints to reliable indicator modeling; (iii) modeling is most appropriate at aggregated spatial scales such as provinces or large watersheds, while modeling at smaller ecosystem-based spatial levels is feasible but unreliable; and (iv) linking the use of deterministic and qualitative modeling approaches is a useful means for projecting indicators and discerning important policy linkages, while conventional statistical modeling approaches are frequently inappropriate because of unreliable or non-commensurable data. This has profound implications for indicator selection and modeling. In contrast to much of the current indicator work, which relies on selecting a large number of detailed specific indicators, it would be more fruitful and less costly to focus attention on a small number of indicators within selected indicator classes (such as economic, social, environmental or human health indicators). The precise specification of the indicator within each of these classes is of less consequence. Indicator modeling work should focus on larger scale systems, as opposed to smaller ecosystem units. Such work is most suited to identifying qualitative policy trade-offs and implications, rather than to forecasting specific indicators. Data gathering efforts can be scaled down substantially and should be informed, but not unduly constrained, by available model frameworks. Greater focus is required on modeling frameworks that can use incomplete data sets or qualitative information, and linking existing quantitative model structures to external qualitative models.

AB  - Osprey(Pandion haliaetus) eggs were collected during 1995 and 1996 at seven sites along the Fraser and Columbia River systems of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, USA. Fifty-four eggs were placed into a laboratory incubator. Thirty-eight of the hatched chicks were sacrificed within 24 h. Hatching success did not differ among sites and therefore between treatment and reference areas. Residual yolk sacs of eggs collected downstream of the large bleached-kraft pulp mill at Castlegar contained greater mean concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, 2,930 ng/kg lipid) compared with reference sites such as the Nechako River, an upper tributary of the Fraser system (33.7 ng/kg). Total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in yolk sacs were also higher at Castlegar and in samples from the Columbia River downstream of Portland, Oregon, compared with those from the Nechako River. Concentrations of measured chemicals, including TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs), total PCBs, p, p′-dichlorodiphenylethylene (p, p′-DDE), and other organochlorines were not different in eggs that failed to hatch compared with calculated whole-egg values for hatched eggs. There were significant biochemical responses; a hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) cross-reactive protein was detected in all samples tested and correlated positively with ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD) activity and yolk sac concentrations of TEQs and total PCBs. Tissue concentrations of vitamin A compounds varied among sites and correlated positively with yolk sac concentrations of TEQs and PCBs. Morphological, histological, and other physiological parameters, including chick growth, edema, deformities, and hepatic and renal porphyrin concentrations, neither varied among sites nor showed concentration-related effects.

AB  - Changes made to municipal boundaries are an important part of the process of urban growth. Boundary adjustments usually involve responding to urban sprawl occurring outside the municipal limits and to development trends occurring within the city as boundaries are altered to 'make room' for urban development. There has been little research within the Canadian context on the frequency of boundary adjustments undertaken by Canadian municipalities through time and by province. Existing studies tend to focus on individual case studies, included as part of a broader urban history, or they focus on general policy implications. This paper examines the broad sweep of annexation frequencies, temporal and spatial patterns through the post-war years, 1941 to 1991, for the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Descriptive statistical tests, such as analysis of variance, are used to examine comparisons of key variables within each province. The paper presents and analyzes statistics on annexation to answer three questions: (i) How important is annexation? One approach to this question is to assess how much annexation has taken place. The answer to this question can be taken as a partial measure of urban growth through annexation. (ii) How has annexation activity been distributed through time? Is annexation of only historical importance or are there significant contemporary events? (iii) How has annexation activity varied by province? The findings reveal that annexation is a pervasive form of local government reorganization. The frequency of annexation is shown to be related to municipal class, growth rate and population size. Annexation is also found to be unevenly distributed over time and space.

Six antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains belonging to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas were used as inocula. For controlled environment assays, surface sterilized seeds were inoculated with log 6 Bacillus or log 8 Pseudomonas colony-forming units (cfu) under gnotobiotic conditions for assessment of rhizosphere and internal root and stem tissue colonization. In the field trial, one-year-old, container-grown hybrid spruce seedlings were inoculated with each of the Bacillus or Pseudomonas strains 1–2 days before planting at nine field sites in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. All six strains colonized the rhizosphere with log 5.6−7.6 cfu g−1 root tissue under controlled environmental conditions. Two strains, Bacillus Pw-2R and Pseudomonas Sm3-RN, were also recovered from internal root and stem tissues with population sizes ranging from log 3.9 to log 5.0 cfu g−1 plant tissue. In the field trial, PGPR survived the winter in the rhizosphere with populations of log 2 to log 5 cfu g−1 root tissue 17 months after inoculation. In addition, spruce growth was significantly enhanced by bacterial inoculation at certain sites. The most effective growth-promoting strains were the endophytes, Sm3-RN and Pw2-R, and the external root colonizing strain, Ss2-RN. These three strains increased seedling dry weight up to 57% above noninoculated controls at five of the nine outplanting sites. Pseudomonas strain Sw1 and the other two Bacillus strains produced mean spruce dry weight increases at four of the sites. Seedling growth inhibition due to bacterial inoculation was detected at some sites. Our results confirm the short-term, site specific effectiveness of PGPR for reforestation of conifer seedlings, and indicate that benefits of a single inoculation at planting can extend through the second year in the field. In addition, bacteria capable of colonizing the seedling interior may be more effective PGPR for spruce than those restricted to the rhizosphere and the root surface. However, site specific seedling growth promotion may necessitate matching PGPR strains to outplanting sites for effective growth promotion.

AB  - The main findings of the current study were that exposing adult sockeye salmon Onchorhynchus nerka to a warm temperature that they regularly encounter during their river migration induced a heat shock response at an mRNA level, and this response was exacerbated with forced swimming. Similar to the heat shock response, increased immune defence-related responses were also observed after warm temperature treatment and with a swimming challenge in two different populations (Chilko and Nechako), but with some important differences. Microarray analyses revealed that 347 genes were differentially expressed between the cold (12–13° C) and warm (18–19° C) treated fish, with stress response (GO:0006950) and response to fungus (GO:0009620) elevated with warm treatment, while expression for genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0006119) and electron transport chain (GO:0022900) elevated for cold-treated fish. Analysis of single genes with real-time quantitative PCR revealed that temperature had the most significant effect on mRNA expression levels, with swimming and population having secondary influences. Warm temperature treatment for the Chilko population induced expression of heat shock protein (hsp) 90α, hsp90β and hsp30 as well as interferon-inducible protein. The Nechako population, which is known to have a narrower thermal tolerance window than the Chilko population, showed even more pronounced stress responses to the warm treatment and there was significant interaction between population and temperature treatment for hsp90β expression. Moreover, significant interactions were noted between temperature treatment and swimming challenge for hsp90α and hsp30, and while swimming challenge alone increased expression of these hsps, the expression levels were significantly elevated in warm-treated fish swum to exhaustion. In conclusion, it seems that adult O. nerka currently encounter conditions that induce several cellular defence mechanisms during their once-in-the-lifetime migration. As river temperatures continue to increase, it remains to be seen whether or not these cellular defences provide sufficient protection for all O. nerka populations.

AB  - In July, the Cheslatta sought an injunction from the BC Supreme Court to halt work on an access road. The presiding judge, Justice Robert Hutchison, known as the "one-day judge", abruptly ended the hearing claiming that Cheslatta's lawyer, Karen Wristen, had "just run out of time." She was unable to finish her closing arguments. After months of delays, the BC Supreme Court will finally hear the legal arguments from both sides in mid February 1997. The Huckleberry Project Committee, composed of representatives from Environment Canada, the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, the BC Mines Branch, as well as the Cheslatta and Wet'suwet'en First Nations, reviewed the mine proposal. However, Cheslatta critics say the committee's deliberations were based on incomplete information concerning metal concentration, toxin leachate, water quality and other hydrological factors. When more information was provided, specifically about the chemical characterization of the ore and design of the mine, it was not properly referred back to the project committee for full reassessment. The committee also lacked adequate information regarding the habitat and migratory patterns of fish, birds and wildlife that will be affected by the mine. A major claim of the mining lobby has been that BC will gain substantial economic benefits from the Huckleberry project. In 1995, Alan Savage, president of New Canamin Resources Ltd., sent a letter to then employment and investment minister Glen Clark, stating that "with export sales value in excess of $100 million per year at today's metal prices, this project can provide a significant contribution not only to the people of the Bulkley Valley, but, indeed, the province as a whole." Mine opponents say the Huckleberry mine will only employ approximately 200 people while all the ore will be shipped to Japan for processing.

AB  - Large areas of bedrock in Canada, such as in the interior plateau of British Columbia, are covered by a thick glacial overburden. Lateral variations in overburden thickness can create spurious anomalies in gravity data. These anomalies can be of a size and amplitude similar to those associated with mineral bodies and can be mistaken for them. A methodology is introduced that corrects gravity data for changes in overburden thickness through the use of a bedrock topography map created by integrating information from a helicopter transient electromagnetic survey with geological survey data, well water data, and gravel pit locations. The approach is tested for a 68 km x 38 kin area in the prospective Nechako interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. The methodology extends the traditional Bouguer corrections by taking into account the gravitational contribution of the overburden. Results show that the capability of an airborne survey to detect a change in overburden thickness depends primarily on survey line spacing and to a lesser extent on the level of random noise in the gravity data. The bedrock topography correction has the capability of removing the gravitational attraction of overburden for the purpose of revealing, through interpretation, geological structures in the gravity data that originate from the bedrock and are otherwise concealed.

AB  - Wildlife incidents with aircraft cost airports and operators worldwide an average of US$1.28bn annually. In Canada, Airport Wildlife Management Plans (AWMPs) are designed to provide an outline of specific wildlife hazards at airports and recommend countermeasures to minimise strike risk. Wildlife incident reports are a key component in the development of such plans. Here, wildlife incident reports were compiled and compared to data collected using newly-installed digital wildlife camera trap technology at the Prince George International Airport. Seven camera traps were monitored for a total of 2,426 sampling days (9,228 camera days) between 2009 and 2016 and recorded a total of 3,046 animals within 16 different animal species/groups. Airport personnel recorded 4,640 animals and 23 different species/ groups during the same period. Camera traps recorded almost five times as many animals (n = 2,525) on days when no wildlife incident reports were filed than days when wildlife incident reports were filed (n = 521) and camera traps recorded no images. Z-test for proportions analyses indicated that birds (ie flocks) were more commonly observed and reported by airport personnel than were captured by camera traps, while mammals such as moose (Alces alces), black bears (Ursus americanus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were more commonly recorded by camera traps. These findings suggest that data from camera traps can help in the development of more informed AWMPs.

AB  - Wildlife strikes are a significant issue in the aviation industry, especially strikes with medium- to large-sized mammals, which pose a high risk of damage to aircraft and human safety. Despite the identified threat that mammals can pose to aircraft, few works have been published on ways to rank and predict the risk of mammalian species to aircraft. This study used remote camera trap data collected from an array of wildlife camera traps at the Prince George International Airport (YXS), Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, to calculate strike risk for various species of mammals involved in runway incidents between January 2012 and December 2018. Carnivores such as red foxes and coyotes were found to be the highest risk mammal species at YXS, but foxes were found airside infrequently compared to coyotes. Binary logistic regression modelling was used in an attempt to predict variables leading to runway incidents with coyotes at YXS. The highest supported logistic regression model predicting coyote incidents included the variables ‘weekday’, ‘month’ and ‘season’. Although data from camera traps did not help to predict incidents, trend data collected from camera traps mirrored coyote incident data, suggesting that camera traps are useful for capturing times of the day and seasons of the year in which coyotes are active at the airport. Suggestions are provided as to how cameras might be used to track the movement of animals more accurately and what other data could be useful in helping to build risk assessments and models to predict aircraft incidents with mammals of interest.

AB  - To address concerns about regional physician shortages within British Columbia, the University of British Columbia began distributing its undergraduate medical curriculum across multiple campuses (ie, urban Vancouver, small urban Victoria, and rural Prince George) in 2005. The distribution of the pathology curriculum required meeting 3 specific challenges: (i) implementation of high-quality technologies to facilitate distribution; (ii) recruitment of pathologists to teach; and (iii) creation of an electronic pathology learning center. Technological needs were met by a state-of-the-art audiovisual system allowing simultaneous interactive didactic sessions across all 3 sites, and by the use of a digital "virtual slide" system. Recruitment of pathologist educators proved challenging owing to comparatively limited staffing levels at the rural site. A physical and virtual pathology learning center was developed to assist students in self-directed study. Student performance on pathology examinations has proven to be essentially identical pre- and post-distribution, and is equivalent across all 3 sites. Quantitative and qualitative student survey data show that distributed pathology instruction is overwhelmingly well received by medical students at all sites, that pathologists' expertise is very important to students, and that pathology is one of the most popular components of the distributed curriculum. Pathology education continues to be a vital part of a distributed undergraduate medical program, and student grades and feedback demonstrate the value of the teaching and the technologies we have used. To be implemented successfully, the distribution of pathology education requires considerable financial and infrastructure investment, and ongoing commitment from pathologists and university administrators.

AB  - Health care system partners in BC are shifting toward delivering primary care approaches that are socially accountable and reflect the needs of all health partners. A partnership development and strategies workshop that was held on the Gidimt'en territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation was designed to support health care system transformation in Northern BC. Indigenous female health leaders led the workshop planning processes and facilitation to ensure that gender and racial power imbalances were addressed and the planning work was grounded in appreciation and respect for Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Workshop participants included partners from Northern Health, the First Nations Health Authority, northern divisions of family practice, medical staff associations, the Ministry of Health, academia, First Nations communities, and the community at large.Together, they used the"breathing and weaving" approach, an adaptation of the appreciative inquiry method, to discuss health care priorities. The outcomes of the workshop included the development of relationships among participants that were built on trust, mutual understanding, and respect; an increased appreciation of participatory, decolonized workshop design that included traditional healing; and a commitment to ongoing collaboration and health care system transformation to improve health and wellness service access and outcomes.

AB  - In 2015, an infrared camera installation was configured to monitor the shell temperature of the lime kiln at Canfor's Prince George Pulp & Paper mill in Prince George, British Columbia. The camera installation produced a 22-point temperature profile along the length of the kiln. Preliminary data analysis was performed to assess the capability of the thermal cameras to predict product residual carbonate compared to conventional measurements. The cameras were also used for early detection of ring formation, brick loss, and other undesirable conditions. This paper provides a detailed review of the set-up and key findings from this project, which showed that the camera-based set-up improved residual carbonate predictability by up to 67% versus conventional measurements. The paper will also demonstrate the significant benefit of providing quick and easy detection of harmful operating conditions from thermal image analysis, leading to decreased shell damage, repair costs, and downtime.

AB  - Water, surface sediments, and <40 cm rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and northern pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus oregonensis) were collected from Pinchi Lake, British Columbia, and from several nearby reference lakes. Hg concentrations in sediment samples from Pinchi L. were highly elevated compared to sediments from reference lakes, especially in sites adjacent to and downstream of a former Hg mine. In both fish species examined, Hg concentration was positively related to age and/or fork length. In northern pikeminnow, Hg concentrations were also positively related to trophic level (deltaN). Hg concentrations in both fish species were highest in Pinchi L., and were higher in pikeminnow than in rainbow trout of similar size. Average Hg concentrations in small rainbow trout from all lakes, including Pinchi L., were lower than dietary levels reported to cause reproductive impairment in common loons (Gavia immer); however, Hg levels in small pikeminnow from Pinchi L. were sufficiently high to be of concern. The risk for Hg toxicity in the study area is greatest for animals that consume larger piscivorous fish such as larger northern pikeminnow or lake trout, which are known from previous studies to contain higher Hg concentrations.

AB  - This paper addresses the 'immigrant-Aboriginal parallax gap' whereby material connections between immigration and Indigenous dispossession are rarely examined in tandem by considering ways in which the Canadian media frames Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers. Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism.

AB  - Impact of lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe was determined in six sub-areas of Forest Inventory Zone H, near Prince George, British Columbia, using a roadside survey and measurements of mature infected trees. Mistletoe effects on DBH were evident only in two of the sub-areas surveyed (Westlake and Nechako). After correcting DBH measurements for competition (stand density), dbh of 100–120 year old and 121–150 year old trees was reduced 10% and 17% respectively, in the highest mistletoe rating (DMR) category (4.5–6.0). Height/DBH relationships were affected by dwarf mistletoe only in the Nechako area. Mistletoe effects in the Nechako and Westlake areas, in stands older than 120 years with mistletoe ratings of 4.5–6.0, resulted in volume reductions of 28–42%, depending on the effects of mistletoe on height. Further losses might accrue in lodgepole pine stands if clear-cut harvesting were restricted by the BC Forest Practices Code, unless infected stems are selectively removed. Key words: roadside survey, dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR), Forest Practices Code

AB  - ABSTRACT. This article examines contemporary political movements among Dakelh First Nations in British Columbia that have challenged Western modernity's fixation with a future achieved through industrial progress. Aboriginal people have been especially assertive in politicizing the connections between time and place through the display and performance of memory in forms as diverse as life history narratives, the cultural landscape, media and grass-roots development projects. Such constructions suggest that future developments in traditional lands must come through an engagement with the past - its meanings, practices, and significance in the particular places of cultural and economic production. I explore how Dakelh territories serve as sites for imagining and enacting alternative political and development agendas. I argue that these territories have increasingly become spaces forged in the margins of modernity's binary oppositions of self-other, nature-culture and future-past. This finding is not meant to marginalize indigenous territories conceptually or politically, but rather to recognize their centrality to contemporary provincial politics where margins - both geographic and discursive - have become central locations for pursuing sovereignty over land and nation.

AB  - This article discusses collaborative research with the Office of the Wet'suwet'en Nation on their traditional territories in north-central British Columbia, Canada, a forest-dependent region where contemporary and traditional forest resources management regimes overlap. In-depth personal interviews with the hereditary chiefs and concept mapping were used to identify social-ecological linkages in Wet'suwet'en culture to inform the development of culturally sensitive social criteria and indicators of sustainable forest management (SFM) in this region. The preliminary results demonstrate how the CatPac II software tool can be applied to identify key component concepts and linkages in local definitions of SFM, and translate large volumes of (oral) qualitative data into manageable information resources for forest managers and decision-makers. Key words: social criteria and indicators, sustainable forest management, qualitative research, Wet'suwet'en

AB  - Few studies to date examine the cumulative effects of climate change and resource development on social-ecological systems, such as watersheds. In partnership with a watershed alliance we endeavoured to understand the interplay of climate change and resource exploitation impacts in the Nechako River Basin, which drains an area of 52,000 km2 in northwestern Canada as part of the Fraser River Basin. Existing regional climatic studies show a clear warming trend over the last century and a projected mean temperature increase of ∼2°C for the 2050s. Watershed stakeholders determined that hydroelectric development and forestry activities interrelate particularly closely with climate impacts related to ecosystem function, water supply, and (resultantly) community well-being. Mining and oil and gas development do not currently represent a high level of concern, but will become problematic with future resource exploitation or climatic changes. The process was effective in grounding specific, day-to-day realities of climate change. The results illustrate the importance and challenge of considering both impact sources in tandem, and should inform ongoing regional planning and monitoring efforts. A major barrier to performing this type of assessment with regional stakeholders is communicating, cross-referencing, and visualizing the interrelationships between climate change and resource development, which are independently highly complex.

AB  - Working within the sub-discipline of the Geographies of “(dis)Ability,” this article employs a mixed-method approach—using go-along interviews and barrier identification to explore disablement in the City of Prince George, a resource-centred city in British Columbia's northern interior. We shed light on how various habituations of ableism (e.g., inattention to accessibility planning, inadequate and weakly enforced building codes) are implicated in the disablement of individuals. In particular, we focus on ways in which the production of Prince George as a resource-centred, “winter city” reproduces inaccessibility in the landscape, as revealed in the experiences and impressions of residents living with impairment. The approach presented in this article offers unique insights into disablement as it has taken place in and through this remote, northern city. La condition permanente de l'invalidité : vivre au quotidien avec le capacitisme à Prince George, Colombie-Britannique Partant de la sous-discipline des géographies de l'incapacité, cet article repose sur une approche méthodologique mixte qui comprend des entretiens en situation et une démarche d'identification d'obstacles, en vue de réaliser une étude sur l'invalidité à Prince George, une ville d'extraction de ressources située dans la partie continentale nord de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces travaux visent à élucider les diverses insensibilisations face au capacitisme (par exemple, le manque d'intérêt pour l'aménagement de l'accessibilité, les codes de construction inadéquats et peu appliqués) et comment celles-ci ont des conséquences directes sur l'invalidité des individus. Il est question plus particulièrement des moyens par lesquels la production de Prince George en tant que « ville hivernale » d'extraction de ressources confère au milieu un caractère d'inaccessibilité, tel que manifesté à travers l'expérience et les impressions de résidents vivant avec un handicap. De nouvelles perspectives sur l'invalidité vécue au quotidien dans cette ville nordique éloignée se dégagent de l'approche proposée dans cet article.

AB  - Societies produce the space in which they operate through social practices that visualize, administer, and use lands and resources. Because Native peoples have held relatively little political power, their ability to influence the production of space has received little attention. Yet the superimposition of Euro-Canadian social practices onto Native spaces rarely erased native spatiality, but rather created a territory made up of shared and hybrid spaces which resulted from the interaction of Native and Euro-Canadian societies. This paper suggests that the social processes involved in the production of space are perhaps most visible when two parties are negotiating the allocation and management of lands and resources. In the 1970s the Tl'azt'en engaged in negotiations over the construction of a railway through their territory. Through the negotiations Tl'azt'en social and economic goals were inscribed to a significant degree in the spatial organization of the territory. Like current treaty negotiations, the 1970s negotiations involved compromises by both parties, and resulted in the creation of new hybrid social spaces which reflected the goals and strategies of both groups. Les sociétés produisent l'espace dans lequel elles opèrent à travers des pratiques sociales qui visualisent, administrent et utilisent les terres et les ressources. Parceque les peuple Natifs ont eu relativement peu de pouvoir politique, leur capacitéà influencer la production de l'espace a reçu peu d'attention. Cependant, l'imposition de pratiques sociales Euro-Canadiennes sur les espaces Natfs a rarement effacé la spatialité indigené, mais a plutôt crée un territoire composé d'espaces partagés et hybrides, résultat de l'intéraction des sociétés indigènes et Euro-Canadiennes. Cet exposé suggère que les procédés sociaux impliqués dans lá production de l'espace sont peut-être plus visibles quand deux partis négocient l'allocation et la gestion des terres et des ressources. Dans les années 70, le peuple Tl'azt'en s'est engagé dans des négociations au sujet de la construction d'un chemin de fer à travers leur territoire. Dans ces négociations, les buts sociaux et économiques du Tl'azt'en furent inscrits à un degré significatif dans l'organisation spatiale du territoire. Comme les présentes négociations de traité, les négociations des années 1970 ont impliqué des compromis par les deux partis, et ont résultéà la création de nouveaux espaces sociaux hybrides qui reflétaient les buts et stratégies des deux groupes.

AB  - At the Joint Review Panel (JRP) for Enbridge’s proposed Northern Gateway pipeline across northern British Columbia, many participants presenting oral statements situated themselves as decidedly ‘ordinary’ people, with rich connections to the land and landscape. Without speaking of ownership, they nevertheless made claims to the area as their home through highly detailed articulations of knowledge and experience of its natural features. For some, it was also connected to a collective, indigenous territorial claim. In all cases, we argue that it is an articulation of ‘home,’ and that this formed the basis for the political subjectivity that led to their participation in the JRP hearings. Linking the scholarly literature on home with that of political ecology, in this paper we explore the significance of the assertion of experience and knowledge of the physical environment as the basis to claim it as ‘home’ and to assert a political right to defend it from perceived intrusion.

AB  - Little research has examined individual variation in migration speeds of Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.) in natural river systems or attempted to link migratory behavior with physiological and energetic status on a large spatial scale in the wild. As a model, we used three stocks of summer-run sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, to test the hypothesis that individual variation in migration speed is determined by a combination of environmental factors (i.e., water temperature), intrinsic biological differences (sex and population), and physiological and energetic condition. Before the freshwater portion of the migration, sockeye salmon (Quesnel, Chilcotin, and Nechako stock complexes) were captured in Johnstone Strait (similar to 215 km from river entry), gastrically implanted with radio transmitters, and sampled for blood, gill tissue, and energetic status before release. Analyses focused solely on individuals that successfully reached natal subwatersheds. Migration speeds were assessed by an extensive radiotelemetry array. Individuals from the stock complex that migrated the longest distance (Nechako) traveled at speeds slower than those of other stock complexes. Females traveled slower than males. An elevated energetic status of fish in the ocean was negatively correlated with migration speed in most river segments. During the transition from the ocean to the river, migration speed was negatively correlated with mean maximum water temperature; however, for the majority of river segments, it was positively correlated with migration speed. Physiological status measured in the ocean did not explain among-individual variability in river migration speeds. Collectively, these findings suggest that there could be extensive variation in migration behavior among individuals, sexes, and populations and that physiological condition in the ocean explained little of this variation relative to in-river environmental conditions and energetic status. Interestingly, individual fish generally retained their rank in swimming speed across different segments, except when transiting a challenging canyon midway during the migration.

Plant foods were important in the traditional diet of the Wet'suwet'en people, although the bulk of calories, protein, minerals and B vitamins were derived from animal foods. Plant foods were consumed throughout most or all of the year. Large quantities of plant foods, notably berries and fern rhizomes, were collected and stored for winter consumption. Critical contributions from plant foods included vitamin C, fibre, and carbohydrate to balance the consumption of protein in meat. Plant foods also made significant contributions to other nutrients, including iron, calcium and magnesium. The role of plant foods in folate nutrition is still unclear. Medicinal teas, green vegetables and rice root bulbs (Fritillaria camschatcensis) contributed to vitamin C in late winter and spring.

AB  - Although not fully conceptualized as such by geographers, children and concepts of childhood were focal points of colonialism. Well into the twentieth century, Aboriginal peoples in Canada were discursively constructed by colonists as child-like subjects in need of colonial intervention in order that they ‘grow up’ into de-Indigenized Canadian citizens. Further, an important aspect of the colonial project entailed confining Aboriginal children in institutions known as Indian Residential Schools wherein, through material and curricular means, efforts were made to transform the children and dispossess them of socio-cultural identities. Much of the literature on children's geographies contemplates the socially constructed nature of childhood and critiques the pervasive (yet under-evaluated) understanding that childhood is a clear and demarcatable state of being prior to adulthood. Little attention, though, has been paid to historic or social discourses that relegated groups of people to a perpetual state of truncated childhood while simultaneously removing their children in order that those children mature into adults who embodied radically different cultural traits than their ancestors. This paper explores how Aboriginal peoples were doubly confined; firstly, by colonial constructions about children, childhood, and Othered (Aboriginal) peoples and then, secondly, within the material geographies of colonial residential schools.

AB  - This paper is anchored in two recent and concurrent openings, openings that offer opportunities for geographers to consider new modes of engaging colonial violence. The first opening is the release, in Canada, of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report and calls to action. By demanding new types of settler-subject attention to Indigenous peoples and places, it opens new spaces for extending reflection about anti-Indigenous racism and colonial violence in Canadian consciousness. The second opening is geography's growing uptake of creative and humanities-informed theories and practices. These manifest in new knowledges and practices with consequent possibilities for addressing colonial violence. I consider these two openings first by proposing changes to conversations about settler-normalized violences lived by Indigenous peoples, and, second by engaging poets working to radically re/configure language and written expression. Specifically, the paper ends with a call for geographers—particularly non-Indigenous settler geographers—to rethink ways (and forms) by which we produce knowledge, especially about colonialism and Indigenous geographies and especially in and through writing practices. The paper is experimental in form, meant to disrupt easy uptake or digestion of ideas that must remain—for settler subjects—fundamentally ragged, upsetting, and always beyond conclusion, coherence, or closure.

AB  - Indicators of wildlife health are important elements of a comprehensive approach for assessing and monitoring trends of methyl mercury (MeHg) contamination in the environment. River otters (Lontra canadensis) have been used as a model species for toxicological studies on the effects of MeHg bioaccumulation due to their position as an apex predator in aquatic systems and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Although laboratory studies suggest that sublethal MeHg exposure may have detrimental effects on wildlife, they are limited in their ability to reflect real world exposure and forecast population level effects. Few studies have identified the threshold at which MeHg exposure results in a population-level effect for wild populations of river otters in marine or freshwater systems. We used a series of data sets collected over a 7-year period for river otter populations in central British Columbia, Canada, to assess mercury concentrations (river otter fur) and measurements of population status and health relative to a lake with an inactive and reclamated mercury mine along its shoreline (Pinchi Lake). We used a combination of remote cameras, marked individuals, hair snares, and scat counts/inventories to collect measurements of population status and health including: activity levels, population estimates, sex ratios, group sizes, litter sizes, behaviour, stress hormones, diet, and habitat quality. We found that mercury concentrations in river otter inhabiting Pinchi Lake were significantly higher than all other lakes in the study, and were also high relative to other areas in Canada and the United States. We did not, however, detect significant differences between the two lakes in many of the population parameters measured. We discuss the knowledge gaps and challenges of identifying the effects of MeHg for wild populations of mammals, determining sensitive and appropriate methods for measuring these effects, and the implications of our results for monitoring the impacts of natural resources activities. Detailed studies on population effects across a range of exposure and background conditions are required to address these data deficiencies. Typically, river otters are not included as monitoring species in environmental assessments even though their value as an indicator of anthropogenic contaminants has clearly been documented. We encourage inclusion of river otters in environmental assessments pre-, during-, and post-industrial activities as a measure of pollutant exposure and bioavailability as well as a critical first step in addressing knowledge gaps associated with contaminants and its effects on populations.

AB  - Stream temperature impacts resulting from forest harvesting in riparian areas have been documented in a number of locations in North America. As part of the Stuart-Takla Fisheries-Forestry Interaction Project, we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota. However, even modest temperature changes could alter insect production, egg incubation, fish rearing, migration timing, and susceptibility to disease, and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood.

AB  - There is a need to explicitly consider metapopulation dynamics in the development of conservation strategies for spatially structured populations. We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identiﬁed a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied >90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently, other streams make only small contributions to population abundance; however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.

Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently, other streams make only small contributions to population abundance; however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.

AB  - Four white sturgeon were collected from the upper Fraser River near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, in the fall of 1991 and 1992. Two additional fish were taken from the Fraser River near Williams Lake, some 250 km downstream of Prince George. Samples of white muscle, red muscle, liver, and roe were analyzed for metals, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorophenols to determine whether the tissues of this species were acceptable for human consumption. The concentrations of mercury in the white muscle and liver of several fish from the upper Fraser River exceeded the provincial tissue residue criteria for people who consumed low quantities of fish (i.e., 210 g wet weight/week). The concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs (expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents) in red muscle and liver of these fish exceeded the Health Canada working guidelines for the protection of human health. By comparison, white sturgeon collected in the lower Fraser River had much lower concentrations of metals and organic contaminants. The differences in contaminant burdens in fish from the two widely separated reaches of the river reflect their proximity to or distance from known contaminant sources.

AB  - The ability of paleolimnology to reconstruct historical sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) abundance was assessed at Fraser Lake, an important nursery lake in the interior of British Columbia (BC), Canada. Multiple sediment proxies of lake production, as well as nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, all portray relatively complacent stratigraphies, despite well-monitored changes in salmon returns over the most recent 60 years. The separation of autochthonous from total sediment organic matter did not clarify the identification of the nitrogen isotopic fingerprint of marine-derived nutrients (MDN). Slight shifts in diatom assemblages are better interpreted as responses to either early human activities in the catchment or post-Little Ice Age climate warming. The low proportion of MDN in the lake's annual budget (3% N and 7% P) is the probable reason their influence is not expressed in lake sediments. Thus, paleolimnology is incapable of providing unequivocal inferences concerning historical salmon abundances in Fraser Lake, in contrast to lakes from southern Alaska, where the same techniques have yielded unambiguous results. Sediment MDN proxies, together with catchment characteristics and escapement data, were collated for an additional nine sockeye nursery lakes spanning southern Alaska to southern BC. Primary production and biogeochemical cycling in Alaskan nursery lakes appears largely driven by MDN from sockeye returns, whereas BC lakes are more strongly influenced by allochthonous organic matter and lake-water residence times. Alaskan lakes possess the limnological features that are prerequisite for meaningful salmon reconstructions using paleolimnology, while lakes from southern BC do not. This does not suggest that MDN are unimportant in southern BC lakes but rather that they are not readily disentangled from other factors that shape the paleolimnological record.

AB  - Objectives: To explore experiences of fatigue among people with spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and factors perceived to contribute to fatigue. Setting: Kelowna, Prince George, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Study design: Collaborative, qualitative methodology.Methods: Four focus groups were undertaken simultaneously with a total of 29 participants, comprising a purposive sample of men and women: 21 people with complete and incomplete SCI of high and low tetraplegia and paraplegia, 2 family members, 2 assistants and 4 occupational therapists. Interpretive analysis was grounded in the themes identified in the data.Results: Fatigue was perceived to have cognitive, emotional and physical dimensions and to exert a profound effect on the lives of many people with SCI, such that pleasurable activities were often eschewed to enable the accomplishment of more mundane tasks. Factors most consistently associated with fatigue were pain, depression and hopelessness, side effects of medications, poor quality sleep, spasticity, poor posture, diet, and the effort required to accomplish routine and self-care tasks.Conclusions: Fatigue is a complex phenomenon, interlinked with pain, depression and hopelessness that significantly diminishes the quality of life following SCI. Further research is required to provide greater understanding of this issue and to determine appropriate and comprehensive forms of intervention.

Results demonstrated no change in the trend of sexual assault over time; however, odds of sexual assault were significantly higher for women who had at least one parent who attended residential school, had experienced childhood sexual abuse, were involved in sex work, had been offered money to not use condoms, had used injection drugs, had injected cocaine and opiates daily, had binged with injection drugs, and had difficulty accessing clean syringes. Findings highlight the urgency of interventions addressing the complexity of risk and opportunities for healing.

AB  - Rose Prince was a young Indigenous woman who lived during the first half of the twentieth century, spending most of her short life in a Catholic residential school near Fraser Lake, British Columbia, Canada. Shy and retiring in life, Rose's venerators believe that her understated devotion was rewarded by a postmortem miracle generally reserved only for God's greatest saints: incorruption. The Catholic hierarchy and Rose's Carrier people, though at odds on much else, are unanimous that the Lejac Indian Residential School unwittingly hosted a saint between its opening in 1922 and Prince's death in 1949, and the two groups seek together to honor her with an annual pilgrimage to her gravesite. But this fragile unanimity exists in dynamic tension with the two groups’ divergent interpretations of Prince's holiness, particularly as it pertains to the legacy of residential schools. For some within the Catholic hierarchy, Rose's sanctity provides a powerful justification for the much-critiqued assimilative educational system. For many Carrier, however, Prince is its starkest repudiation. For them, Rose was—and is—the heart of a heartless world, incarnating gentle compassion in a system that, while it trumpeted these Christian virtues, itself was notably lacking in them.

AB  - Isolating barriers that drive speciation are commonly studied in the context of two-species hybrid zones. There is, however, evidence that more complex introgressive relationships are common in nature. Here, we use field observations and genomic analysis, including the sequencing and assembly of a novel reference genome, to study an emergent hybrid zone involving two colliding hybrid zones of three woodpecker species: red-breasted, red-naped, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, S. nuchalis, and S. varius). Surveys of the area surrounding Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, show that all three species are sympatric, and Genotyping-by-Sequencing identifies hybrids from each species pair and birds with ancestry from all three species. Observations of phenotypes and genotypes of mated pairs provide evidence for assortative mating, though there is some heterospecific pairing. Hybridization is more extensive in this tri-species hybrid zone than in two di-species hybrid zones. However, there is no evidence of a hybrid swarm and admixture is constrained to contact zones, so we classify this region as a tension zone and invoke selection against hybrids as a likely mechanism maintaining species boundaries. Analysis of sapsucker age classes does not show disadvantages in hybrid survival to adulthood, so we speculate the selection upholding the tension zone may involve hybrid fecundity. Gene flow among all sapsuckers in di-species hybrid zones suggests introgression probably occurred before the formation of this tri-species hybrid zone, and might result from bridge hybridization, vagrancies, or other three-species interactions.

AB  - Regionalization, or the grouping of objects in space, is a useful tool for organizing, visualizing, and synthesizing the information contained in multivariate spatial data. Landscape pattern indices can be used to quantify the spatial pattern (composition and configuration) of land cover features. Observable patterns can be linked to underlying processes affecting the generation of landscape patterns (e.g., forest harvesting). The objective of this research is to develop an approach for investigating the spatial distribution of forest pattern across a study area where forest harvesting, other anthropogenic activities, and topography, are all influencing forest pattern. We generate spatial pattern regions (SPR) that describe forest pattern with a regionalization approach. Analysis is performed using a 2006 land cover dataset covering the Prince George and Quesnel Forest Districts, 5.5 million ha of primarily forested land base situated within the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. Multivariate cluster analysis (with the CLARA algorithm) is used to group landscape objects containing forest pattern information into SPR. Of the six generated SPR, the second cluster (SPR2) is the most prevalent covering 22% of the study area. On average, landscapes in SPR2 are comprised of 55.5% forest cover, and contain the highest number of patches, and forest/non-forest joins, indicating highly fragmented landscapes. Regionalization of landscape pattern metrics provides a useful approach for examining the spatial distribution of forest pattern. Where forest patterns are associated with positive or negative environmental conditions, SPR can be used to identify similar regions for conservation or management activities.

AB  - Background:There is growing evidence demonstrating the benefits of intradialytic cycling. However, there are relatively few centers where this practice has been adopted with no reports from hemodialysis units in rural, remote, and northern locations. Maintaining mobility and quality of life for patients on kidney replacement therapy living in remote northern communities is inhibited by inclement weather and lack of access to resources and infrastructure that support physical activity. The integration of intradialytic cycling during hemodialysis offers patients a form of safe physical activity year-round.Objective:This study focuses on better understanding the feasibility and acceptability of implementing intradialytic cycling in a remote northern geographical context.Design:A feasibility study using a mixed-methods explanatory design was adopted for this study.Setting:The research is conducted in Prince George, British Columbia.Participants:The participants are patients attending a community-based dialysis unit in remote northern British Columbia and health professionals working in the same facility.Methods:Quantitative measures were captured through cycling logbooks and quality of life measure, and qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis.Results:Six (43%) eligible patients used leg ergometers more than once for a median of 2.5 (interquartile range: 1-4) months and 87% of hemodialysis sessions. Participants cycled for a median of 65 (interquartile range: 39-76) minutes per session, with frequent variability noted between participants and different hemodialysis sessions for the same participant. Nine patients completed the European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire prestudy, with 5 (56%) also completing it poststudy. Interviews with 9 patients, 4 nurses, and 1 physiotherapist led to the identification of themes instrumental to implementation: a supportive community dialysis unit, shared responsibility, knowledge of patients/providers, and benefits associated with engagement. Themes that were identified as being key to acceptability in this remote dialysis unit were trust, connection, and engagement through common values.Limitations:Due to dialysis unit size, we had a small number of participants.Conclusions:This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing best practice in a remote community and provides insight into the elements of context and participation that contribute to acceptability in the implementation of intradialytic cycling.

AB  - Despite widespread calls to action from the scientific community and beyond, a concerning climate action gap exists. This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the role of connectedness to nature in promoting individual-level climate action in a unique setting where climate research and action are lacking: Canada’s Provincial North. To begin to understand possible pathways, we also examined whether climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and climate action. We used data collected via postal surveys in two Provincial North communities, Thunder Bay (Ontario), and Prince George (British Columbia) (n = 628). Results show that connectedness to nature has a direct positive association with individual-level climate action, controlling for gender and education. Results of parallel mediation analyses further show that connectedness to nature is indirectly associated with individual-level climate action, mediated by both climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends. Finally, results suggest that climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends serially mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and with individual-level climate action. These findings are relevant for climate change engagement and action, especially across Canada’s Provincial North, but also in similar settings characterized by marginalization, heightened vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. Drawing on these findings, we argue that cultivating stronger connections with nature in the places where people live, learn, work, and play is an important and currently underutilized leverage point for promoting individual-level climate action. This study therefore adds to the current and increasingly relevant calls for (re-)connecting with nature that have been made by others across a range of disciplinary and sectoral divides.

AB  - Plants cut at different times produce resprouts that vary in their nutritional value relative to when they are cut. To determine how vegetation management in transportation (road and rail) corridors at different times of the year could influence browse quality in the years following cutting, and how this could potentially influence encounters between herbivores and vehicles, we undertook a 3-year study. In 2001, at a wildlife viewing area near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, we established a control area and treatment areas where shrubs and trees that are used as food by moose (Alces alces) were cut at the beginning of June, July, August, September, and October. In the fall, moose were most often observed browsing the resprouts of plants cut in August (years 1 and 2 post-treatment) and September (year 3). Cumulative winter track counts were highest in the uncut control area in the years following cutting. Spring pellet counts revealed that most pellets were deposited in the uncut (years 1 and 2) and August-cut (year 3) areas during winter. With the exception of the first year after cutting, browse removal by moose was highest for plants cut later in the growing season. Overall, our findings suggest that following cutting, plants cut later in the year are selected more often by moose relative to those cut earlier. To reduce browse use of corridor vegetation in areas where concerns for moose-vehicle collisions exist, we recommend that vegetation maintenance activities be conducted in the early summer months of June and July.

AB  - The Gitksan and Wet’suwet’en of Northwestern British Columbia formerly used landscape burning to manage patches of black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), the most important plant resource of their seasonal round. In view of its significance one might postulate that managed sites would conform to a biophysical or ecological type to maximize return for effort. However, a survey of a number of traditionally managed sites indicated that managed sites are characterized by wide variation in biophysical attributes including elevation, aspect and moisture regime, while proximity to fishing sites, village sites, or sites for harvest of alpine resources proved to be a common factor in known historic berry patch sites. We conclude that characterization of the ideal site type for aboriginal V. membranaceum management must include the economy and social institutions of the local First Nations and requires an enhanced appreciation for the sophistication of the strategies and techniques employed in their management and utilization of the species.

AB  - The mental and emotional dimensions of climate change are increasingly concerning as extreme events become more frequent and severe, ecosystem destruction advances, and people become more aware of climate impacts and injustices. Research on climate emotions has rapidly advanced over the last decade with growing evidence illustrating that climate emotions can impact health, shape climate action, and ought to be considered in climate change communication, education, and engagement. This paper explores, describes, and discusses climate emotions in the context of Canada’s Provincial North: a vast region characterized by a vulnerability to climate change, remoteness, political marginalization, diverse Indigenous populations, and economies/livelihoods tied to resource extraction. Using postal survey data collected in two Provincial North communities (Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Prince George, British Columbia; N = 627), we aim to (1) describe climate emotions experienced in the context of Canada’s Provincial North, including relationships among specific emotions; and (2) examine if socio-demographic variables (gender, age, and parenthood) show a relationship with climate emotions. Results show high levels of emotional response to climate change overall, with worry and frustration as those emotions reported by the highest percentage of participants. We also find significant difference in climate emotions between men and women. A methodological result was noted in the usefulness of the Climate Emotion Scale (CES), which showed high reliability and high inter-item correlation. A notable limitation of our data is its’ underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples. The findings contribute to a greater understanding of climate emotions with relevance to similar settings characterized by marginalization, vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. We discuss our findings in relation to the literature and outline future research directions and implications.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss an innovative course offered as a partnership between the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) (Canada), the Prince George Chamber of Commerce (Canada) and local businesses: UNBC’s third-year undergraduate/graduate course, carbon and energy management. Design/methodology/approach The authors have all participated in the development, design and/or delivery of the course and have provided their reflections on the experience. In addition, they sought insights from students and other interested people on the impact and significance of this course. Findings Carbon and energy management is an action learning-based co-created course initiated by the Chamber to address an interest in mitigating climate change amongst local businesses. Among businesses, the carbon economy is under considerable discussion. The increased awareness of climate change, and the need to better manage carbon, has led to local businesses eager to reduce greenhouse gases but lacking the expertise necessary. UNBC students (undergraduate and graduate) learn innovative and practical skills through creating carbon footprint analyses for small- to medium-sized business/non-profit clients, providing recommendations on reducing reliance on fossil fuels and formally presenting their findings to their clients. After five years, 46 businesses and non-profit organizations have participated in the course along with over 30 students and 5 separately hired student interns. The Chamber is now rolling out the program for Canadian Chamber of Commerce interested in similar community–university partnerships. Originality/value This paper describes a course that is a novel approach to university–community partnerships, both in approach and focus area. The linking, through the course, of small- to medium-sized businesses with the provision of plans for carbon reduction developed by university students is an unusual approach. However, there is significant value to all partners in the approach. Allowing the main community partner to serve as the lead in the project also offers an unusual experience and perspective for the university partner, as often such partnerships are largely driven by the post-secondary institution’s interests and needs, which can create a challenging power dynamic. Instead, the course offers a lesson in how a university can be clearly in service to the community at the community’s invitation. Finally, this paper offers reflections on the value of this type of project for creating sustainability initiatives from the perspective of all participants, students, faculty, university administration, city government, participating businesses and the Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating the critical need for understanding a project as an intersection of all participating actors.

AB  - Background.Mental health and wellbeing, including addressing impacts of historical trauma and substance use among young people, has been identified as a key priority by Indigenous communities and leaders across Canada and globally. Yet, research to understand mental health among young Indigenous people who have used drugs is limited. Aims.To examine longitudinal risk and strengths-based factors associated with psychological distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs. Method.The Cedar Project is an ongoing cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver, Prince George, and Chase, British Columbia, Canada. This study included participants who completed the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, returned for follow-up between 2010 and 2012, and completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Adjusted linear mixed-effects models estimated effects of study variables on changes in area T-scores of psychological distress. Results.Of 202 eligible participants, 53% were women and the mean age was 28 years. Among men, childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect), any drug use, blackouts from drinking, and sex work were associated with increased distress. Among women, childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect), blackouts from drinking, and sexual assault were associated with increased distress, while having attempted to quit using drugs was associated with reduced distress. Marginal associations were observed between speaking their traditional language and living by traditional culture with lower distress among men. Conclusion.Culturally safe mental wellness interventions are urgently needed to address childhood trauma and harmful coping strategies that exacerbate distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs.

AB  - There is a paucity of research that evaluates climate change adaptation actions. Academics partnered with the City of Prince George, in Northern British Columbia, Canada, for over five years to explore and address adaptation. After an adaptation strategy was created, eight initiatives oriented towards implementation were pursued. These initiatives focused on incorporating adaptation into local plans, and in-depth explorations of impacts related to forests, river flooding and effects to transportation infrastructure. This article summarizes the initiatives pursued and assesses their effectiveness through semi-structured interviews with local planners, engineers, managers, community champions and politicians. The initiatives deemed to be most successful—and most likely to continue after the project has ended—focus on topics that: are of high public concern; have clear cost implications; incorporate adaptation into policy; and/or promote tangible outcomes. Results highlight both benefits and drawbacks associated with ‘mainstreaming’ adaptation into existing plans and strategies, and the importance of building and maintaining internal capacity.

AB  - Spawner escapements for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are frequently estimated by using a variety of methods over time. To evaluate temporal patterns in escapements, the data must be standardized. In our study, we standardized escapement data from 1980 to 1998 for the chinook salmon O. tshawytscha of the Nechako River in British Columbia. This particular stock and period were chosen because (1) escapement had been estimated by several methods that could be standardized and (2) escapement estimation methods and data had previously been summarized in detail and were readily available. The area-under-the-curve method of estimating escapement had been used since 1987, and after minor adjustments in 1989, methods had remained constant. To evaluate whether differences in methods for earlier years affected analysis of trends in escapement over time, we converted the data for years 1980–1988 to area-under-the-curve equivalents. The mean of reported escapements for the 1980–1988 period increased from 18% to 22% after standardization. The increase demonstrates the importance of standardizing data when analyzing trends in Pacific salmon escapement data.

AB  - Background:Incarceration and homelessness are closely related yet studied rarely. This article aimed to study the incarcerated homeless and identify specific vulnerabilities, which rendered them different from the nonincarcerated homeless. It also aimed to describe the homeless population and its significant involvement with the criminal justice and enforcement system.Methods:Data were derived from the British Columbia Health of the Homeless Study (BCHOHS), carried out in three cities in British Columbia, Canada: the large urban center Vancouver (n = 250), Victoria (n = 150) and Prince George (n = 100). Measures included socio-demographic information, the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus.Results:Incarcerated homeless were more often male (66.6%), were in foster care (56.4%) and had greater substance use especially of crack cocaine (69.6%) and crystal methamphetamine (78.7%). They also had greater scores on emotional and sexual abuse domains of CTQ, indicating greater abuse. A higher prevalence of depression (57%) and psychotic disorders (55.3%) was also observed. Risk factors identified which had a positive predictor value were male gender (p < .001; odds ratio (OR) = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7?4.4), a diagnosis of depression (p = .02; 95% CI: 1.1?4.4) and severe emotional neglect (p = .02; 95% CI: 1.1?3.2) in the childhood.Conclusion:Homeless individuals may be traumatized at an early age, put into foster care, rendered homeless, initiated into substance use and re-traumatized on repeated occasions in adult life, rendering them vulnerable to incarceration and mental illness.

AB  - The objective of this study is to analyze relationships between the variability of MODIS derived snow covered area (SCA) and flood dynamics for the management of reservoirs. The study was conducted in the Nechako River Basin in British Columbia (Canada). Relationships were analyzed between daily SCA calculated from filtered MODIS images and the fraction of the flood volume that had already entered the reservoir during the snowmelt period. Results indicate a robust (R2 = 0.87) and significant (p < 0.001) correlation over a 14-years (2000-2013) period. A similar analysis was conducted for each sub-basin, producing an even more robust relationship (R2 = 0.90) for the Tahtsa Lake sub-basin. Two distinct relationships corresponding to years with either large or small spring runoff were identified by classifying years according to their maximum snow water equivalents (SWE), peak inflows and flood volume, thus improving the correlations. These empirical relationships are a simple forecasting tool that does not require any additional data other than MODIS SCA and SWE measurements. This straightforward approach can be applied to other mountainous watersheds dominated by snow accumulation and melt.

AB  - The water resources of Canada are today, and have always been, of major importance to the welfare of Canadians. Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply–management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of ‘megaprojects’, often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, ‘First Nations’ peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects – especially dam construction – on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T’En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan).

AB  - The management of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and/or exurban settings is of growing concern as these mammals, along with coyotes, cougars and others, begin to re-colonize areas from which they had been extirpated. Urban and exurban landscapes can offer much needed habitat to these space-demanding creatures, thereby buffering habitat losses in other areas and protecting populations of these species, but only if conflicts between these animals and humans can be managed and minimized. In the case of urban black bears, they can become quickly labled as a “problem” bear if they become too reliant on human garbage or other food sources such as fruit trees. A “problem” bear usually becomes a dead bear. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, UNBC researchers undertook two surveys of Prince George over a 3 year period and a companion survey in the city of Coquitlam, BC to examine attitudes towards urban bears. The research found that residents of both cities, in spite of regular and close encounters with black bears, strongly supported the presence and preservation of bears within an urban setting, largely due to conservation concerns. Both communities were supportive of non-lethal control of “problem bears” and supported the use of warnings and fines to discourage human behaviors that created human-bear conflicts over lethal controls. These findings offer support for municipal governments to reconsider approaches to urban bear management.

AB  - Across rural North America, aboriginal and nonaboriginal people have formed strategic alliances to defend what are perceived to be common resources and attachments to place. Thus far, little is known about how these partnerships have factored into indigenous pursuits of territorial autonomy. This article describes how the Cheslatta T'en, a Dakelh (Carrier) community in north-central British Columbia, established a measure of control over their homeland after forming an alliance with local nonnative residents. Cheslatta leaders used cultural exchanges and social networks generated by the alliance to fashion territorial initiatives that, when taken together, channel popular environmentalism, provincial forestry policies, and ancestral ethnoecology into collective identity, action, and authority. As a result, the band has attained political influence over its traditional lands without participating in the province's treaty settlement process. Interethnic partnerships in rural areas are particularly relevant to political ecology because they reveal how the common experience of powerlessness can generate new forms of resource management that synthesize diverse constructions of nature. In this way, the paper contributes to the growing empirical work on such alliances and to emerging frameworks for a political ecology of social movements. It also adds to the ethnographic literature on the colonial encounter in British Columbia by highlighting the role of interethnic collaboration in contemporary rural resource management projects.

AB  - BACKGROUND:Young Indigenous people, particularly those involved in the child welfare system, those entrenched in substance use and those living with HIV or hepatitis C, are dying prematurely. We report mortality rates among young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia and explore predictors of mortality over time. METHODS:We analyzed data collected every 6 months between 2003 and 2014 by the Cedar Project, a prospective cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios using Indigenous and Canadian reference populations. We identified predictors of mortality using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS:Among 610 participants, 40 died between 2003 and 2014, yielding a mortality rate of 670 per 100 000 person-years. Young Indigenous people who used drugs were 12.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.2–17.5) times more likely to die than all Canadians the same age and were 7.8 (95% CI 5.6–10.6) times more likely to die than Indigenous people with Status in BC. Young women and those using drugs by injection were most affected. The leading causes of death were overdose (n = 15 [38%]), illness (n = 11 [28%]) and suicide (n = 5 [12%]). Predictors of mortality included having hepatitis C at baseline (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.47–5.16), previous attempted suicide (adjusted HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.01–3.50) and recent overdose (adjusted HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.00–8.09). INTERPRETATION:Young Indigenous people using drugs in BC are dying at an alarming rate, particularly young women and those using injection drugs. These deaths likely reflect complex intersections of historical and present-day injustices, substance use and barriers to care.

AB  - Drawing on ongoing patterns of learning and relationship, this paper offers a reflection and acknowledgement on the notable influence of two rivers and their role as respected and highly valued “eco-social elders”: The Taieri River in Otago, New Zealand, and the Nechako River in northern British Columbia, Canada. The paper is motivated by the question: “If a river has ‘voice’, what can be learned from the emergence arising from rivers ‘in conversation’?”. At the heart of the reflection are the themes of confluence and emergence—ways in which we grasp the coming together of things, especially when that combination is more than the sum of their parts. The paper aims to explore a “conversation” between the river teachings of the Taieri River and the Nechako River, identifying examples of patterns and connections between distinct river “voices,” and how these may contribute to emergence and ongoing conversations among different rivers and their teachings. The paper commences with an introduction to both rivers, identifying points of direct comparison and contrast, then moving to explore themes of confluence, weaving and emergence, combining ecological, metaphorical, and personal perspectives. The conversation then progresses downstream to river–ocean relationships, reflecting on rivers as eco-social elders that inspire conversations, provide a sense of home, and offer a point of reference to consider the wider influence on rivers and waterways on the health of diverse species within catchments and across the planet.

AB  - Many studies have defined the interrelationships between climate, forest disturbance, and runoff at small scales (500 km(2)). In this study, we explore the relationship between climate, extreme forest fire seasons, mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks, and runoff in eight large watersheds within the Fraser and Peace drainage basins in British Columbia (BC), Canada from 1981-2019. Using a climate index based on precipitation and air temperature anomalies, we find extreme forest fire seasons (those that burned >5% of a watershed's area) are most likely to occur when a warm/dry summer is preceded by multiple seasons of cool/wet conditions. Using the climate suitability class (CSC) model to explore the relationship between climate and MPB outbreaks, we validate previous findings that lower-than-average precipitation, warm growing season temperatures, and lack of extremely cold temperatures during winter are connected to MPB outbreaks within central BC. However, the CSC model needs improvements to accurately assess MPB suitability in northern watersheds that are located outside the model's calibration region, either through weighted variables or lower degree day thresholds. Minimal runoff response occurs from these forest disturbances, with the most prominent runoff change being related to the 2014 fire season in the Osilinka and Mesilinka watersheds. The limited effects of forest disturbance on annual runoff are likely related to large watershed sizes, low percentages of disturbed area in some study watersheds and post-MPB forest dynamics. These results provide valuable insight into the interrelationships of climate, forest disturbance and runoff in large Canadian boreal forested watersheds.

AB  - Watersheds are settings for health and well-being that have a great deal to offer the public health community due to the correspondence between the spatial form of the watershed unit and the importance to health and well-being of water. However, managing watersheds for human health and well-being requires the ability to move beyond typical reductionist approaches toward more holistic methods. Health and well-being are emergent properties of inter-related social and biophysical processes. This paper characterizes points of connection and integration between watershed management and public health and tests a new conceptual model, the Watershed Governance Prism, to determine the prevalence in peer-reviewed literature of different perspectives relating to watersheds and public health. We conducted an initial search of academic databases for papers that addressed the interface between watershed management (or governance) and public health themes. We then generated a sample of these papers and undertook a collaborative analysis informed by the Watershed Governance Prism. Our analysis found that although these manuscripts dealt with a range of biophysical and social determinants of health, there was a tendency for social factors and health outcomes to be framed as context only for these studies, rather than form the core of the relationships being investigated. At least one cluster of papers emerged from this analysis that represented a cohesive perspective on watershed governance and health; “Perspective B” on the Watershed Governance Prism, “water governance for ecosystems and well-being,” was dominant. Overall, the integration of watershed management/governance and public health is in its infancy.

AB  - Local governments can encourage proactive action on climate change by incorporating adaptation measures into long-term planning documents. The authors undertook action-oriented, case study research by participating (as adaptation experts) in the process to create a sustainability and land use policy plan for the City of Prince George, Canada. A range of adaptation measures was incorporated into both documents. Factors enabling the incorporation of adaptation included a high level of local awareness, an existing adaptation strategy to draw upon and the flexible process used to create the plans. Challenges such as a lack of priority, limited policy direction and perceptions of climate change as solely an environmental challenge persist as barriers to incorporating adaptation into local plans, particularly in smaller centres.

AB  - Field data and a forced, modal-based, two-layer, variable-cross-section model (TLVC) were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in a large multibasin reservoir, Nechako Reservoir (British Columbia, Canada). The TLVC showed that most of the thermocline deflections at the dam could be accounted for by considering the first two basins upstream of the dam, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and that the thermocline deflections were dominated by the first (H1) and second (H2) horizontal baroclinic modes of the combined basins. Calibration of the TLVC against the field data showed that the H1 and H2 modes were strongly damped, with effectively no free thermocline oscillations. This strong damping had two effects: high coherence between the wind and thermocline deflections and phase lags between thermocline deflections at different locations. The damping in Nechako Reservoir is stronger than in many lakes, and results from both high velocities within the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes and drag due to submerged trees, which cover 30% of the bed. Our study provides a picture of overdamped baroclinic response and shows how useful information about the baroclinic response in complex bathymetries can be obtained using relatively simple tools such as the TLVC.

AB  - The Aluminum Company of Canada, Limited (Alcan) has proposed completion of its hydroelectric developments to increase aluminum smelting capacity in north-central B.C. The project was started in 1950 and included the Kenney Dam on the Nechako River in the Fraser catchment area, the creation of the Nechako Reservoir, and the construction of facilities for generating power at the Kemano River on the west coast. Completion of development (Kemano Completion Proposal), at a cost of over $2 billion, would divert 84 percent of the initial mean annual discharge of the Nechako River, and 62 percent of the mean annual discharge of the Nanika River in the Skeena catchment area, to the Kemano River. The proposal offers discharges that are intended to protect Pacific salmon stocks, or, where this is not possible, mitigation of losses. This paper identifies the more obvious effects of abstraction and regulation on salmon populations and their habitat. These include interference with migration of adults, changes in the quality of spawning gravel, imposition of stress on all stages of the fish from high total gas pressures and from alterations in ambient temperature, changes in the composition of the total fish community, changes in the production and availability of food, stranding of fish, weakening or loss of cues for homing, and increased exposure to predation from fish and birds. A major difficulty in trying to relate effects to salmon populations lies in distinguishing fish numbers as determined by habitat effects, from numbers determined by the level of recruitment to the rivers as a result of exploitation by the fishery. Three approaches to the problem are: experimental design of impact assessment, modelling changes of discharge and salmon habitat, and analysis of case histories of regulated discharge. The last seems to be the most instructive per unit of effort required. As an approximation to obtaining replication of treatment effects, and to judge the reliability of prediction of effects of flow regulation, case histories of regulated salmonid rivers were examined. It was found that negative effects outnumbered positive ones, that prediction was usually incorrect, and that, even where flow regulation was implemented with the express intention of increasing numbers of salmonids the results fell short of expectations. On this evidence it appears that the outcome of a development as demanding of water as Kemano Completion is difficult to predict in precise quantitative terms and carries some risk for natural populations.

AB  - The Aluminum Company of Canada, Limited (Alcan) has proposed completion of its hydroelectric deveiopments to increase aluminum smelting capacity in northcentral B.C. The project was started in 1 950 and included the Kenney Dam on the Nechako River in the Fraser catchment area, the creation of the Nechako Reservoir, and the construction of facilities for generating power at the Kemano River on the west coast. Completion of development (Kemano Completion Proposal), at a cost of over $2 billion, would divert 84 percent of the initial mean annual discharge of the N echako R iver, and 62 percent of the mean annual d ischarge of the N anika River in the Skeena catchment area, to the Kemano River. The proposal offers discharges that are intended to protect Pacific salmon stocks, or, where this is not possible, mitigation of losses. Tiris paper identifies the more obvious effects of abstraction and regulation on salmon populations and their habitat. These include interference with migration of adults, changes in the quality of spawning gravel, imposition of stress on all stages of the f ish f rom high total gas pressures and from alterations in ambient temperature, changes in the composition of the total fish community, changes in the production and availability of food, stranding of fish, weakening or loss of cues for homing, and increased exposure to predation from fish and birds. A major diff iculty in trying to relate effects to salmon populations lies in distinguishing fish numbers as determined by habitat effects, from numbers determined by the level of recruitment to the rivers as a result of exploitation by the fishery.

On this evidence it appears that the outcome of a development as demanding of wateras Kemano Completion is difficult to predict in precise quantitative terms and carries some risk for natural ooDUlations.

AB  - Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93% and 99%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.

AB  - A mixed-stock fishery occurs when multiple populations of a fish species are exploited together in a common area where they aggregate outside the breeding season (e.g. for feeding or overwintering), and the aggregation is known as a mixture. Recreational fishing often exploits such mixtures, and estimating the proportional contributions of populations to fisheries promotes more sustainable resource use. Ten DNA microsatellites were assayed in a mixture of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus Suckley overwintering in the Nechako River, upper Fraser River, British Columbia, and in baseline population samples from 14 tributaries putatively contributing to the overwintering mixture. A DNA microsatellite-based mixed-stock fishery analysis suggested that five populations together contributed 0.80 to the mixture. Most of the errors associated with the mixture estimates were attributable to uncertainty in baseline allele frequencies. Radiotracking data confirmed that tributary populations contributing to the mixture estimated by genetic analysis also contained individuals that moved between spawning tributaries and overwintering sites. The results better resolve habitat use by potadromous bull trout in the upper Fraser River and, in combination with assessments of baseline population-specific spawning abundances and productivity, will better inform a decision of whether or not allowing some harvest within the current catch-and-release fishery is biologically sustainable.

AB  - You Are On Indian Land, a Challenge for Change documentary shot during a border-crossing blockade on Akwesasne territory (near Cornwall, Ontario) in 1969, helped interrupt the colonial legacy of Canadian cinema. Since then, activism in defense of Wet'suwet'en struggles to protect unceded territory, including remarkable uses of video and social media, carry on the transformative spark of this and other Indigenous films. Until recently, Indigenous filmmaking in Canada has mostly been relegated to informational and documentary programming because this is the genre sanctioned by colonial institutions. The commercial success of Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner (2001), disrupted this gatekeeping, and the release of Mi'kmaq filmmaker Jeff Barnaby's Rhymes for Young Ghouls (2013) and Blood Quantum (2019) completely shattered the imposed barrier. Barnaby's films are about the crimes of colonialism inflected through the zombie-horror and revenge-fantasy genres. This article weaves together these formative moments of Canadian documentary and fiction filmmaking with respect to issues of justice, land claims, and visual sovereignty, raising the question of what it means to represent Indigenous social struggles in popular film genres and what they say about the concept of Canadian identity.

AB  - The political-legal discourse of Indigenous rights continues to be separated from discussions of health care services in geographic scholarship, due to the ways in which political-legal, settler-colonial definitions of rights fail to take Indigenous understandings into account, as well as a distrust on the part of scholars of the limited and contingent notion of "rights." While Indigenous rights, inherently tied in Canada to recognition by the settler colonial state, have limited application in achieving social justice or decolonization for Indigenous peoples, we argue that Indigenous rights can be used as a complementary discourse to Indigenous resurgence, within broader discourses of Indigenous justice, to lend legal and political weight to arguments for cultural safety and human rights in health care. We draw on a study conducted with 50 Indigenous community members and 15 health services professionals in the northern city of Prince George, Canada, to elucidate how Indigenous peoples' experiences in health care settings may be improved by giving attention to rights discourse and removing the geographic and identity-based limitations of Indigenous rights to health care in Canada.

AB  - On 1 December 2016, British Columbia's (BC) provincial drug insurance program changed which medications in certain classes would benefit under the insurance program in an attempt to reduce expenditure. As part of the modernization, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins), Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) were affected. Prescribers and pharmacists had six months to discuss the changes with patients, and change medications if deemed necessary. Purpose: To quantify the changes made to prescriptions and to adjust to the Modernized Reference Drug Program. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two clinics in Prince George, BC. Charts for patients that were prescribed any drugs in the affected classes were reviewed to determine if, and when, they had been changed, and by which health care professional. In December 2016, a clinical pharmacist, integrated within the study clinics, informed prescribers of the changes, and made patient-specific clinical notes within the charts. The notes described the changes and recommended alternative agents and appropriate dosing in order to assist the prescriber to have a conversation with the patient regarding the switch. Results: Out of 429 unique patients, 233 patients were prescribed a Statin, 229 patients an ACEI, 110 an ARB and, 83 a CCB. Sixty-five drug changes were indicated to reflect the modernization, and with guidance from a clinical pharmacist, nurse practitioners (NPs), and family physicians (FPs), 65% of these identified drugs were switched to reflect the modernization. Community pharmacists made no drug changes in the study sample, despite the prescriptive authority and compensation available to do so. Province-wide, approximately 21% to 33% of affected drugs were switched during the same time-frame. Direct collaboration between a clinical pharmacist, working alongside NPs and FPs, was more successful in optimizing these medications when compared to standard practice, or community pharmacists alone.

AB  - The telling of birth stories (i.e. stories that describe women's experiences of giving birth) is a common and important social practice. Whereas most research on birth narratives reflects the stories of middle-class, adult' women, we examine how the birth stories told by early-age mothers interconnect with broader narratives regarding social stigma and childbearing at too early' an age. Drawing on narrative theory, we analyse in-depth interviews with 81 mothers (ages 15-24years) conducted in Greater Vancouver and Prince George, Canada, in 2014-15. Their accounts of giving birth reveal the central importance of birth narratives in their identity formation as young mothers. Participants' narratives illuminated the complex interactions among identity formation, social expectations, and negotiations of social and physical spaces as they narrated their experiences of labour and birth. Through the use of narrative inquiry, we examine the ways in which re-telling the experience of giving birth serves to situate young mothers in relation to their past and future selves. These personal stories are also told in relation to a meta-narrative regarding social stigma faced by teenage' mothers, as well as the public's gaze' on motherhood in general - even within the labour and delivery room.

AB  - Unusual channel-amphitheatre landforms are present in Late Pleistocene-early Holocene, subaqueous fan and delta deposits in the glacial Lake Fraser basin, central British Columbia. The lake formed during the decay of the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet and drained-11,500 years ago during a large outburst flood. The fronts of a delta and two subaqueous fans consisting of silt to fine sand are marked by branching networks of wide, nearly flat channels that terminate upstream in digitate, steep-walled amphitheatres. We propose that these channel amphitheatre landforms formed by liquefaction flowslides that were induced by the rapid drawdown of glacial Lake Fraser during the outburst flood. Similar geomorphic forms, which we believe also to be associated with rapid drawdowns of large Late Pleistocene-early Holocene lakes, occur elsewhere in North America. A recent tailings dam failure and an intentional breaching of a 100-year-old hydroelectric dam provide insights into the processes responsible for the landforms. By using geomechanical analysis, we show how rapid lake drawdown can trigger liquefaction flowslides in deposits of silt to fine sand. The novelty of our approach lies in combining geomechanical reasoning with geomorphic analogues to understand histories of ancient glacier-dammed lakes and of the glacial lake outburst floods that are sourced from them.

AB  - Background:Studies suggest that Aboriginal people in Canada are over-represented among people using injection drugs. The factors associated with transitioning to the use of injection drugs among young Aboriginal people in Canada are not well understood. Methods:The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study (2003–2007) involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants’ venous blood samples were tested for antibodies to HIV and the hepatitis C virus, and drug use was confirmed using saliva screens. The primary outcomes were use of injection drugs at baseline and tranisition to injection drug use in the six months before each follow-up interview. Results:Of 605 participants, 335 (55.4%) reported using injection drugs at baseline. Young people who used injection drugs tended to be older than those who did not, female and in a relationship. Participants who injected drugs were also more likely than those who did not to have been denied shelter because of their drug use, to have been incarcerated, to have a mental illness and to have been involved in sex work. Transition to injection drug use occurred among 39 (14.4%) participants, yielding a crude incidence rate of 19.8% and an incidence density of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years. In unadjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use was associated with being female (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06–3.72), involved in sex work (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.75–6.40), having a history of sexually transmitted infection (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.07–3.78) and using drugs with sex-work clients (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.19–5.32). In adjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use remained associated with involvement in sex work (adjusted OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.45–10.71). Interpretation:The initiation rate for injection drug use of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years among participants in the Cedar Project is distressing. Young Aboriginal women in our study were twice as likely to inject drugs as men, and participants who injected drugs at baseline were more than twice as likely as those who did not to be involved in sex work.

AB  - Many current tree improvement programs are incorporating assisted gene flow strategies to match reforestation efforts with future climates. This is the case for the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), the most extensively planted tree in western Canada. Knowledge of the structure and origin of pathogen populations associated with this tree would help improve the breeding effort. Recent outbreaks of the Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) pathogen Dothistroma septosporum on lodgepole pine in British Columbia and its discovery in Alberta plantations raised questions about the diversity and population structure of this pathogen in western Canada. Using genotyping-by-sequencing on 119 D. septosporum isolates from 16 natural pine populations and plantations from this area, we identified four genetic lineages, all distinct from the other DNB lineages from outside of North America. Modeling of the population history indicated that these lineages diverged between 31.4 and 7.2 thousand years ago, coinciding with the last glacial maximum and the postglacial recolonization of lodgepole pine in western North America. The lineage found in the Kispiox Valley from British Columbia, where an unprecedented DNB epidemic occurred in the 1990s, was close to demographic equilibrium and displayed a high level of haplotypic diversity. Two lineages found in Alberta and Prince George (British Columbia) showed departure from random mating and contemporary gene flow, likely resulting from pine breeding activities and material exchanges in these areas. The increased movement of planting material could have some major consequences by facilitating secondary contact between genetically isolated DNB lineages, possibly resulting in new epidemics.

AB  - The theoretical premise of this paper is that place is an unbounded material, social and cultural agent within and through which practices of colonialism were enacted in British Columbia. Specifically, the places of British Columbia's ‘Indian’ residential schools, and the subjects who occupied them, are conceptualized as intimate sites nested within Canadian colonial and nation-building agendas that were predicated on policies of assimilation, enculturation or annihilation of indigenous people. Such conceptualizations allow for an understanding of both how colonialism was actualized against First Nations' peoples and how First Nations' peoples actively navigated and resisted that colonial project. In order to access experiences of residential school places, the article draws from published First Nations' testimonial literatures. It also draws from creative materials produced by students within the schools in order to understand how First Nations' students articulated against assimilative educational processes. The article concludes with a consideration of how nested place, First Nations' resistances, and Euro-colonial concepts of gender are circulating today with reference to a Dakelh woman (and former residential school student) under consideration for beatification in northern British Columbia.

AB  - Unlike the historic settlement of the rest of Canada, treaties with the First Nations originally occupying most of present-day British Columbia have never been finalized. Since 1993, the federal government of Canada, the provincial government of British Columbia, and approximately two-thirds of the First Nations in British Columbia have been engaged in treaty and land claim negotiations under a unique British Columbia treaty process. To date the process has produced only five agreements, three of which are fully ratified, one of which is in the ratification process, and one of which was rejected by the First Nations membership. This article reviews the history of treaties in British Columbia and uses exploratory illustrative case studies to examine two of these recent treaty negotiations—the Lheidli T'enneh First Nations and the Tsawwassen First Nations. These case studies demonstrate that treaty negotiations are very complex processes and do not always achieve mutual agreement, yet features of governance and land ownership included in these agreements have implications for land use policy and planning that affect all First Nations people in British Columbia, in Canada, and around the world.

TI  - “Show-Stopper” — Effectively Managing Project Social Risks: Improved Approaches to Aboriginal Engagement and Consultation
TY  - journalArticle
AU  - Mathewson, Andrew
AB  - A number of proposed pipelines in western and northern Canada have highlighted critical path social risks associated with effectively engaging and consulting with impacted Aboriginal rightsholders along pipeline rights-of-way. Opening up new markets for Canada’s oil sands, shale and off-shore gas resources will require an expansion of the pipeline system in northern British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. While navigating the regulatory approval process can be a formidable hurdle, a far greater challenge is how proponents manage the process of building relationships and consulting with affected Aboriginal communities. Failing to earn Aboriginal support for proposed projects can be a “show-stopper”.Exploration of new basins in Canada, driven by increased demand for energy in Asia, may compete with other land uses and constitutionally-protected rights and practices of indigenous peoples. Public, media and environmental response to new pipelines is often lead by the reaction of impacted communities. The task of identifying the social risks to a project, understanding the engagement process, fulfilling the regulatory consultation requirements of different jurisdictions, balancing impacts with benefits, managing issues and resolving disputes, communicating with the public and media effectively all require improved skills and approaches.The paper surveys the stakeholder engagement experience and differences in approaches for recently proposed major arctic gas and western oil pipeline projects, as well as pipelines to service Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities on the Pacific north coast, providing practical insights with possibly international application. Utilizing decision and risk analysis and scenario planning methodologies, applied to development of an Aboriginal engagement and consultation strategy, the paper examines how multi-billion dollar investments in new pipelines can be better secured by integrating stakeholder engagement into a project’s risk management design. With greater precision and improved approaches proponents can effectively manage social risks, reduce stakeholder conflict and associate project uncertainties.

AB  - Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh First Nation communities have traditionally used smoking, drying, and salting of fish and game as preservation methods to enhance food security. Our results showed that levels of 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were significantly higher in smoked salmon samples compared to moose meats, and further, that PAH contents were also dependent on the duration of smoke processing. Benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) was not detected in fresh or partially smoked foods, but was present in both fully smoked moose (1.4 μg/kg) and fully smoked salmon (3.6 μg/kg) meats, respectively. The total concentrations of PAH present in fully smoked meats using traditional smoke processing methods employed by Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh nations indicate that a risk assessment is required to determine the safety of these smoke-processed foods.

AB  - Objectives: Decreased quality of life in diabetes is associated with poor health outcomes. Far-infrared sauna treatments improve the quality of life for those with chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and congestive heart failure. The objective of this study is to determine whether far-infrared saunas have a beneficial effect on quality of life in those with type II diabetes. Design: This was a sequential, longitudinal, interrupted time series design study. Setting/location: The setting was Fraser Lake BC, a rural village in central British Columbia, Canada. Subjects: All patients of the Fraser Lake Community Health Center with type II diabetes were invited to participate in this study. Interventions: The study consisted of 20-minute, 3 times weekly infrared sauna sessions, over a period of 3 months. Outcome measures: To assess quality of life, subjects completed the 36-item Short-form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) questionnaire as well as "Zero-to-Ten'' Visual Analogue Scales. Baseline study parameters were measured within 1 week prior to commencing sauna sessions. Postintervention measurements were collected between 1 and 3 days after the last sauna session. Results: Physical health, general health, and social functioning indices of the SF-36v2 improved. Visual Analogue Scales for stress and fatigue improved. Conclusions: Far-infrared sauna use maybe associated with improved quality of life in people with type II diabetes mellitus. Uptake of infrared saunas use is greater than the uptake of other lifestyle interventions.

AB  - It is a common practice to employ hydrologic models for assessing present and future states of watersheds and assess the degree of alterations for a range of hydrologic indicators. Previous studies indicate that the hydrologic model may not be able to replicate some of the indicators of interest, which raises questions on the reliability of model simulated changes. Hence, we initiated a study to evaluate the replicability of the streamflow changes by employing the widely used variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model for sub-basins and mainstem of the Fraser River Basin, Canada. Given that the hydrologic regime of the region is known to be influenced by teleconnections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we used hydrologic responses to the PDO and ENSO states as analogues for evaluating the model's ability to simulate climate-induced changes. The results revealed that the qualitative patterns of response, such as lower flows for the warm PDO state compared to the cool state, and progressively higher flows for the warm, neutral and cool ENSO states, were generally well reproduced for most hydrologic indicators. Additionally, while the directions of change between the different PDO and ENSO states were mostly well replicated, the magnitude of change for some of the indicators showed considerable differences. Hence, replicability of both magnitude and direction of change need to be carefully examined before using the simulated indicators for assessing future hydrologic changes, and a reliable replication increases the confidence of projected changes.

AB  - This article is a response to Kassam, Avery, and Ruelle’s insights as presented in this forum on rural science education. Topics considered include troubling the urban/rural divide in the context of Indigenous knowledge and expanding to include the common Canadian notion of the “remote”, a designation rooted in our national colonial narrative for the mythic, typically northern, wilderness sparsely inhabited by primarily Indigenous peoples. These concepts are further considered through exploration of Indigenous and allied ecological activism in Canada and the United States related to the proposed Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines. This discussion concludes with an argument for the inherent pedagogical opportunity presented by such cases for contemporary educators to engage students in consideration of wicked problems, geographically rooted cognitive diversity, and the legal, economic, ecological, and cultural underpinnings and ramifications of the current events prominent in their home communities and abroad.

Organic-rich lake sediment samples were collected towards the centre of approximately 500 lakes on a helicopter-assisted survey covering some 16,000 km2. Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region.

AB  - At Pinchi Lake, the Pinchi Fault Zone separates the early Mesozoic Takla Group to the east from the late Paleozoic Cache Creek Group to the west. Between these regions a complex fault system involves a series of elongate fault-bounded blocks of contrasting lithology and metamorphic grade. These blocks consist of: (a) highly deformed aragonite–dolomite limestone and blueschist, (b) pumpellyite–aragonite greenstone, (c) a harzburgite–gabbro–diabase–basalt ophiolite sequence, (d) serpentinized alpine ultramafite, and (e) Cretaceous (?) conglomerate. The blueschist probably formed at 8–12 kbar (8 × 105–12 × 105 kPa) and 225–325 °C during a penetrative early deformation which was closely followed by a later deformation associated with a Late Triassic uplift and cooling event.

Comme on le redéfinit ici, il comprend trois formations dans la région de McConnell Creek. A la base on retrouve la formation de Dewar, composée d'argillite, de grès volcaniques qui sont à peu près l'équivalent distal des coulées basiques et des roches volcaniclastiques grenues de la formation de Savage Mountain. Ces formations sont recouvertes par les roches volcaniclastiques basiques et intermédiaires de la formation de Moosevale. Ces roches datent du Triassupérieur (Karnien supérieur et Norien inférieur). Elles sont finalement recouvertes en discordance par les roches du groupe de Hazelton datant du Jurassique inférieur. [Traduit par le journal]

AB  - After many years of colonisation and oppressive policies, Indigenous cultures in Canada are reviving elements of their cultural heritage. As such, numerous Indigenous communities are working with higher learning institutions to safeguard elements of their heritage, specifically, knowledge and land-based practices. In this article, we discuss one case study of Dakelh [Indigenous) knowledge-holders that merged the practice of traditional moose-hide tanning with academic components surrounding issues in cultural heritage. With the intention of transmitting information about the field of ICH as well as safeguarding one Dakelh intangible cultural heritage element, we developed an experiential-learning university course that grounded theoretical issues in Indigenous cultural heritage. In discussing our methodology of merging the two ways of learning and teaching, including the benefits and challenges of such a course, the article elaborates how the combination of traditional and academic methodologies in a university setting can help Indigenous communities transmit their intangible cultural heritage to younger generations.

AB  - Objectives: This study sought to document the trends in drug use among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in northern British Columbia, and to discuss the public health implications. Method: We conducted a 7-year medical-chart review of all IDU-related admissions (n= 2072) to an inpatient alcohol and drug detoxification centre in Prince George, British Columbia. Primary detoxification diagnosis was modeled onto year of admission using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: Our study demonstrated an increasing prevalence of cocaine as the primary detoxification diagnosis in IDU-related admissions in northern from 32% of all IDU admissions in 1999 to 64% in 2001, and then a relatively steady elevated rate of approximately 60% between 2001-2005. Conclusions: Given that needle exchange programs and other harm reduction services for IDUs in British Columbia are not readily available in many northern and rural areas, the risks associated with intravenous cocaine use among northern IDUs represent a serious public health challenge. Tailored harm reduction strategies should take into account the prominence of intravenous cocaine use as an HIV risk factor. In areas without wellestablished intravenous drug use monitoring programs, such as rural and remote areas, detoxification treatment records may serve as important sentinels for changing drug use patterns among IDUs. Objectifs : Notre étude visait à documenter les tendances de la consommation de drogue chez les utilisateurs de drogue injectable (UDI) dans le Nord de la Colombie-Britannique et à examiner leurs conséquences pour la santé publique. Méthode : Nous avons examiné les fiches médicales sur 7 ans de toutes les hospitalisations d'UDI (n=2 072) dans un centre de désintoxication de Prince George (Colombie-Britannique). Le principal diagnostic de désintoxication a été modélisé sur l'année d'hospitalisation à l'aide d'équations d'estimation généralisées (EEG). Résultats : L'étude a montré une prévalence croissante de l'abus de cocaïne comme principal diagnostic de désintoxication dans les hospitalisations liées à l'utilisation de drogues injectables du Nord de la Colombie-Britannique; ce diagnostic est passé de 32 % des hospitalisations d'UDI en 1999 à 64 % en 2001, puis il s'est stabilisé à un niveau relativement élevé (environ 60 %) entre 2001 et 2005. Conclusion : Étant donné que les programmes d'échange de seringues et autres services de réduction des méfaits destinés aux UDI en Colombie-Britannique ne sont pas aisément accessibles dans de nombreuses régions nordiques et rurales, les risques associés à l'injection de cocaïne chez les UDI du Nord présentent un défi de taille pour la santé publique. Les stratégies de réduction des méfaits adaptées doivent tenir compte de la prédominance de la consommation de cocaïne par voie intraveineuse comme facteur de risque du VIH. Dans les secteurs qui n'ont pas de programmes établis pour la surveillance de l'utilisation de drogues injectables, les régions rurales et éloignées par exemple, les dossiers des centres de désintoxication peuvent être d'importantes sentinelles des changements dans les habitudes de consommation de drogue des UDI.

TY  - thesis
AU  - Diana Kutzner
AB  - Many Aboriginal communities in British Columbia, Canada and worldwide, are on the search for new development opportunities and industries to diversify their economies. Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with tourists.

AB  - The people of the Nechako region are not unfamiliar with hardship, environmental devastation and protecting what they hold dear. June Wood chronicles the history of the Nechako River and its region, covering the construction of the Kenney Dam, which changed forever the flow of the river and its tributaries; the controversial Kemano Completion Project, which threatened to doom the river further still; and the subsequent battles to protect the river and the communities affected by its altered flow. She also delves into the aftermath of the devastating mountain pine beetle epidemic that severely harmed the economy of the region. An active participant in many of the fights to protect the Nechako River, Wood is one of the most qualified people to speak on behalf of the land she calls home. She passionately introduces a river whose once forceful flow has been weakened to a mere trickle and sympathetically relays the harsh realities of environmental ruin—both to the river and the forest through unnatural and natural causes—while weaving in her personal narrative of the land that holds her heart.

AB  - "The purpose of this research was to critically engage a contemporary means by which impacts to Indigenous health are gauged during federal and/or provincial environmental assessments (EAs). Specifically, I was interested in the utility of health impact assessments (HIAs) conducted during environmental assessments, which concern the effects of mining on First Nations communities. For this research, I dialogued with participants from the Tl’azt’en nation in order to learn their opinions and concerns about the impact of industrial development on health from an Indigenous world-view perspective. An Indigenous methodological research design was followed and participants were recruited to share their perspectives on health impact assessments in a focus group setting. From stories and narratives gathered during these focus group sessions, themes emerged that I argue must form a foundation for future health impact assessments. If rooted within the context of the Indigenous nation, the health impact assessment might accurately and justly represent Indigenous health realities in terms of the negative changes(s) that industrial development may create on unceded Indigenous lands."

TY  - book
SN  - 978-0-88922-354-7
AB  - On January 23, 1995, British Columbia’s then premier announced that he was cancelling Alcan’s Kemano Completion Project. But is such a simple political announcement all it will take to cancel this $1.4 billion hydro megaproject? Many tough questions remain: about who will pay for the cost of cancelling this megaproject, already half-completed at the time of Mike Harcourt’s announcement; about whether or not binding legal contracts dating from 1950 and 1987, between Alcan and the governments of Canada and British Columbia can be broken by a simple political decision; and about why Alcan has fought so hard to preserve a project which makes absolutely no sense, either economically or environmentally.This book outlines the 45-year history of Alcan’s industrial activities in British Columbia, uncovers the back-room political deals that have made those activities possible, and discusses the roles Canada’s federal and provincial governments must play in their attempts to reverse the dangerous precedents that the Alcan deals have set.It also examines the consequences for Canada and North America if these governments fail to address responsibly the mess that they themselves have created.This book is a must-read for those who wish to remain informed on the question of who is to control North America’s vital water and power resources in the twenty-first century.

TY  - generic
AU  - International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission
AB  - This report has been prepared by the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission to review and summarize efforts made in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries of Canada to protect the sockeye salmon of the Nechako River System. Sockeye salmon produced by separate runs or races spawning in various tributaries of the Nechako River will be adversely affected in varying degree by reduction of flow due to construction of the Kenney dam on the Nechako River. The dam is owned by the Aluminum Company of Canada. All flow from above the damsite was stopped on October 8, 1952. There will be no spill whatsoever from the reservoir until approximately June, 1957. Less than normal inflow to the reservoir or installation of any generating units in addition to the three now being installed will further delay the spill. Eventual installation of 16 generating units (full capacity) would result in spillage of excess water only during years of above-normal inflow and perhaps not then if the reservoir had been drawn down in previous years by drafts exceeding inflow. During the period of migration the sockeye enroute to the Stuart watershed will have to swim 55 miles up the Nechako in an average of 40% less flow than was formerly available. Sockeye migrating to the Nautley River watershed must swim an additional 58 miles in the Nechako River reduced an average of 82% in flow during the migration period. Sockeye runs to the Nechako watershed include the followning separate and distinct races: The Early Stuart, Driftwood, and Lake Stuart races all migrate up the Stuart River, tributary to the Nechako, and spawn in various streams above Stuart Lake. The Stellako, Nadina, and certain minor races migrate up the Nechako to the Nautley confluence and spawn in Nautley system tributaries after which they are named.Protection of the salmon resource requires that flow in the residual river be of such depth and velocity that sockeye can swim up the stream successfully and without undue delays. In addition it has been considered necessary for the mean temperature of the river to be below 68 degrees Farenheit if sockeye are to find tolerable conditions. Calculations based on temperatures data collected in 1950 and 1951 show that reduced depth and velocity of flow would have resulted in river temperatures high enough to be intolerable to sockeye during portions of July and August, if the dam had been closed in those years. Races of sockeye which may be affected by the expected high temperatures include the Nadina River stock, portions of the early Stuart run and of the Stellako run. The race of sockeye spawning in the Nadina River is undergoing rapid rehabilitation, with large returns expected in 1953 from a spawning stock of 21,600 fish in 1949. Available area of spawning beds, size of the rearing area in Francois Lake, and historical records establish that the Nadina run can exceed in value that produced by the Stellako River, now worth $1,344,000 annually. It is estimated that the Nadina sockeye run is worth $2,000,000 annually. In addition, high river temperatures may have lethal effects upon portions of the rapidly improving early run to the Stuart River watershed, already worth $778,000 annually. Gaps in the temperature data make a more precise prediction impossible. The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission is charged under a treaty between Canada and the United States with the duties of protection, preservation and extension of the sockeye salmon fisheries of the Fraser River system. The Commission is empowered only to make recommendations to the governments of Canada and the United States for the removing or otherwise overcoming of obstructions to the ascent of sockeye salmon. The Commission has made recommendations to the two governments concerning the obstruction to sockeye created by the Alcan-Nechako project in reports data January, 1951 and Febrary, 1952. The former report was prepared jointly with the Fisheries Research Board of Canada and the Department of Fisheries of Canada. The latter was prepared jointly with the Department of Fisheries of Canada.The joint recommendations made in these reports called for damming of the Cheslatta tributary system to provide water for aiding upstream migration of sockeye and spring salmon and to provide cover water for spring salmon, which are main river spawners. The Company has done this, although a disagreement over the type of outlet works is still unresolved. The reports asked that channel modifications be made to aid migration. It has been mutually agreed that joint examination of the river channel in June,1953 will disclose final requirements for such modifications. The reports also recommended that cold water be released from the Nechako reservoir at or near the damsite at a depth of 200 feet or more to relieve the temperature problem as it occurs. There is no other solution to the temperature problem. The Company has refused to make any provision for the release of water for temperature control. The Commission's estimate of $500,000 as the cost of providing the required outlet works no longer applies. The estimate was based on construction before sealing of the diversion tunnel and commencement of filling of the reservoir. No estimate has been made of cost of any scheme for release of cold water under present conditions. Time would not permit construction of such an outlet works before its possible need in 1953, even if all other obstables were overcome.Federal Fisheries legislation applicable to the situation appears to be Clause 10, Section 20 of the Fisheries Act, as follows:"(10) The owner or occupier of any slide, dam or other obstruction shall permit to escape into the river bed below the said slide, dam or other obstruction, such quantity of water, at all times, as will, in the opinion of the Minister, be sufficient for the safety of fish and for the flooding of the spawning grounds to such depths as will, in the opinion of the Minister, be necessary for the safety of the ova deposited thereon."The above clause relates to quantity of water rather than to quality, i.e. cold water, although it may be contended that the entire flow could be required, however impractical the suggestion may be. Negotiations have been conducted continuously by the Minister of Fisheries and Aluminum Company officials. The Minister has reserved the right to require the Company to release cold water if observations made after closure warrant the need. The Commission has at all times made its data and conclusions available to the Department and the Company to aid in finding a successful solution to the problem. The Commission at this time is presenting a review of progress to date together with its reiterated conclusion that cooling water is required for full protection of the Nechako sockeye.

AB  - The structure and stratigraphy of the southeast Nechako Basin, which are poorly understood primarily because of substantial volcanic cover, are investigated in an analysis of seismic reflection, well, and potential field data. Formation and development of the SE Nechako Basin resulted in sub-basins containing Cretaceous and Eocene rocks. Interpretation reveals that dextral transtension in the Early to Middle Eocene created NNW-trending, en echelon, strike-slip faults linked by pull-apart basins, which locally contain a thickness of Eocene volcaniclastic rocks of >3 km. This structural pattern is consistent with regional observations that suggest the transfer of slip from the Yalakom fault to the north via a series of en echelon strike-slip faults. In the Middle to Late Eocene, faults associated with a change in the direction of stress, echoed by the north-trending right-lateral Fraser fault, reactivated and cut earlier structures. A simple model agrees with local observations, that northeast-directed compression was subparallel to the relic Cretaceous grain. Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous throughout the basin and may be remnants of a broader basin, or a number of contemporaneous basins, formed in a regional transpressional tectonic setting that caused northeast-directed thrusting along the eastern side of the Coast Plutonic Complex. Results suggest that thrusting affected most of the SE Nechako Basin, as observed across the Intermontane Belt to the northwest and southeast. The pattern of deposition of Neogene volcanic rocks of the Chilcotin Group was in part controlled by the Eocene structural grain, but we find no evidence of Neogene deformation.

AB  - Geological investigation of the near-surface in the southeastern Nechako Basin is difficult. Shallow seismic reflection imaging is poor due in part to an extensive cover of Eocene and Neogene volcanic rocks. Outcrops of these volcanic rocks, and the primarily Cretaceous bedrock, are commonly obscured by Quaternary deposits and vegetation. Estimates of near-surface P-wave velocity are derived from the tomographic inversion of seismic first-arrivals, an effective tool when seismic imaging is poor. Tomographic model velocities are in agreement with sonic logs and laboratory samples, except for those from the Neogene Chilcotin Group. Cretaceous sedimentary rocks have velocities of ~2800-4200 ms.... The Eocene Endako and Ootsa Lake groups, which have velocities of ~3000-4200 ms..., are not distinguishable based on velocity. The velocity, the character (density, focus, and penetration depth) of rays, and ties with well and surface geology constrain the subsurface extent of the Endako Group adjacent to well b-82-C. The Chilcotin Group typically exhibits velocities (~2400-3000 ms...) lower than corresponding velocities from sonic logs (4500-5200 ms...) and laboratory measurements (5000-5200 ms...). These low model velocities may be due to the presence of high porosity, brecciated rocks near to the surface, in comparison with the other measurements that have focussed on lower porosity massive lavas. The lowest mean velocities, located to the southeast, are related to anomalously thick, high porosity, breccia-rich deposits of Chilcotin Group. This conclusion is consistent with the interpretation that the Chilcotin Group is thicker in paleo river valleys. (ProQuest: ... denotes formulae/symbols omitted.)

AB  - Onset and termination of Eocene felsic volcanism in the Chilcotin Plateau of central British Columbia is constrained between 54.6 and 46.6 Ma by 33 new U-Pb and ...Ar/...Ar isotopic age determinations. Dates were obtained from representative felsic coherent and fragmental volcanic rocks that comprise the Ootsa Lake Group. The resulting chronostratigraphy shows that magma compositions evolved from felsic to intermediate, with no spatial migration of the volcanic activity. Rhyolitic compositions are oldest; and are overlain by dacitic rocks with varied phenocrysts assemblages. In many parts of the Chilcotin Plateau, the Eocene stratigraphy is capped by distinctive vitreous black dacite lavas, which are contemporaneous with andesitic lavas of the Endako Group in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Crystallization ages from Ootsa Lake Group rocks of the Chilcotin Plateau overlap age determinations from correlative rocks of the Nechako Plateau and southern BC. Collectively, this geochronological dataset supports previous suggestions of a voluminous Early Eocene-aged (55-46 Ma) period of volcanism in the Intermontane Belt. The abrupt initiation of volcanism, as well as the wide extent, thickness, and compositions that characterize Eocene volcanic rocks may be explained by cessation of subduction and formation of a slab gap beneath British Columbia in the Early Eocene.

AB  - Following growth of the Canadian Cordillera during the Mesozoic, the southern Cordillera was subject to extension during the Paleocene and Eocene that correlated with widespread volcanic activity in south- central British Columbia, including across much of the Nechako- Chilcotin plateau. In 2008, Geoscience BC acquired 330 km of deep vibroseis reflection profiles on the plateau, mostly over the Stikinia arc terrane, but also over its eastern contact with the oceanic Cache Creek terrane. All seven seismic reflection lines reveal a strongly reflective lower crust that extends from 7 to 9 s down to the Moho, which is defined by the downward termination of reflectivity at 11- 12 s. In the uppermost crust, extension occurred by block faulting with faults soling into subhorizontal to shallowly dipping detachments above 10 km depth. Extension in the deeper upper and middle crust, which was partly controlled by antiforms likely related to earlier shortening, was accommodated on a network of anastomosing shear zones that sole out into the top of the reflective lower crust. The lower crustal reflections correlate with seismic P- wave velocities of 6.45- 6.98 km/ s, indicating that the reflective lower crust has a more mafic composition than the middle crust. As in other extensional settings, we suggest that this pervasive fabric of reflectors arises from the intrusion of mantle- derived basaltic magma into zones of ductile shearing, and that differentiation of these melts resulted in the widespread Paleocene to Eocene volcanism. Reflector dips indicate that extension was approximately east- west, consistent with north- northwest- trending horsts separated by basins filled with Paleocene to Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.

AB  - While radiation therapy for breast cancer can be omitted in some settings, in others it is now being recommended more often. Radiation is usually recommended for patients with invasive breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. Internationally, there is general agreement that regional nodal radiation is beneficial when four or more nodes are positive, and in BC adjuvant regional nodal radiation also tends to be offered to all patients with any number of positive nodes after both breast conserving surgery and mastectomy. Most patients who are found to be node-negative after mastectomy do not require adjuvant radiation therapy. However, patients at risk because of their young age or the size and biology of their tumors may be candidates for radiation therapy. Because adjuvant radiation therapy is based on pretreatment staging, it is important to accurately determine both the primary and nodal stage, especially in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Typically, radiation therapy sessions last 15 to 20 minutes and can be given over 16 to 20 sessions. Patients are monitored regularly during treatment for management of side effects, which can include fatigue, dermatitis, and breast/chest wall tenderness. In the long term there can be permanent cosmetic changes, and rare risks of lung, rib, and heart damage, as well as second malignancies. Before 2012 any patient choosing breast conserving surgery in Northern BC needed to travel to a regional cancer centre in Southern BC for adjuvant radiation therapy. Since the opening of BC Cancer Centre for the North in Prince George on 1 November 2012, patients undergoing breast conserving surgery in Northern BC have been able to receive radiation therapy closer to home, and this appears to be why an increasing number of patients in one surgeon's practice have opted for partial mastectomy and adjuvant radiation rather than mastectomy.

AB  - While ministering across the immediate area, Wright was pastor of the Presbyterian Church in Fort George - a structure financed by and built on land donated by the Northern Resources Security Company (NRSC), the sole land agent in the neighbouring (and competing) townsite of Fort George.7 His concern for the state of local morals was not without selfinterest. [...]reports of immorality and vice at the Georges - South Fort George, Fort George, and, in time, Prince George - were journalistic staples. Here we see the play of anthropologist Clifford Geertz's maxim that culture is comprised of the stories that people tell themselves, about themselves, intersecting with the scholarship on boosterism in western Canada.11 Yet rather than emphasize the outward expression of the booster mindset as it has been examined on the Canadian Prairies, this treatment touches on how these depictions tinted the settler population's self-perception.12 In this, the approach also reflects on how the language of race informed and distorted local identity in the Georges.13 Ultimately, for the Interior's white settlers, the provincial government's eventual response to the Georges' competing demands satisfied few and contributed to a gnawing fear that opinion leaders and policy-makers in southern and urban British Columbia neither heard nor cared about concerns born beyond their own communities. After years of negotiation and manoeuvre, the confirmation in 1902 that the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTP) would be built through northern British Columbia sparked the enthusiastic search for prime locations along the anticipated line.15 An immediate point of interest was the region near the junction of the Nechako and Fraser Rivers, where commentators believed the line would cross on route from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific coast (see Figures 1 and 2).16 While the railway, the federal government, and the provincial governments argued, pushed, and prodded each other into concessions and agreements, settlers and adventurers ventured into the northern Interior, and South Fort George emerged as an unincorporated cluster of homes, roads, and businesses huddled alongside the paddlewheel landing established on the Fraser River in early June 1909.17 Founded by Alexander G. Hamilton in 1906 when he opened a store at the site, the community owed its name to the fact that it lay south of Fort George, the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) post sited by fur trader Simon Fraser in 1807.18 That post rested on a separate parcel of land south of Fort George Reserve

AB  - In some hydrological systems, mitigation strategies are applied based on short-range water temperature forecasts to reduce stress caused to aquatic organisms. While various uncertainty sources are known to affect thermal modeling, their impact on water temperature forecasts remain poorly understood. The objective of this paper is to characterize uncertainty induced to water temperature forecasts by meteorological inputs in two hydrological contexts. Daily ensemble water temperature forecasts were produced using the CEQUEAU model for the Nechako (regulated) and Southwest Miramichi (natural) Rivers for 1-5-day horizons. The results demonstrate that a larger uncertainty is propagated to the thermal forecast in the unregulated river (0.92-3.14 degrees C) than on the regulated river (0.73-2.29 degrees C). Better performances were observed on the Nechako with a mean continuous ranked probability score (MCRPS) <0.85 degrees C for all horizons compared to the Southwest Miramichi (MCRPS approximate to 1 degrees C). While informing the end-user on future thermal conditions, the ensemble forecasts provide an assessment of the associated uncertainty and offer an additional tool to river managers for decision-making.

AB  - MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in VV polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the − 3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 91.5% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow-free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

AB  - A new method for regression analysis of longitudinal counts is applied to data from Prince George, British Columbia, previously analysed by Knight et al. The data consist of daily recordings of the number of emergency room visits for each of four categories of respiratory diseases, along with measurements of meteorological variables and air pollution. We use a state-space model assuming conditionally independent Poisson counts for the four categories given a latent morbidity process, the latent process being a gamma Markov process. The main objective of the investigation was to examine the relationship between air pollution and respiratory morbidity, taking into account seasonality and meteorological conditions. We found that total reduced sulphur significantly influences the expected number of emergency room visits for the four disease categories, in agreement with the conclusion by Knight et al. However, our final model is simpler than theirs; in particular we found no evidence of seasonal variation beyond that explained by the meteorological variables.

AB  - Alcan Smelters & Chemicals Ltd. initiated construction of the final phase of the Kemano Completion Project in north-central British Columbia to divert additional water from the Nechako Reservoir to the existing powerhouse. The Nechako Reservoir was created by the construction of the Kenney Dam in Nechako Canyon, a natural barrier to salmon migration. The Nechako River downstream of Nechako Canyon supports important runs of sockeye and chinook salmon. This additional diversion of Nechako River flow creates the potential of high water temperatures and increased thermal stress to migrating sockeye salmon enroute to their spawning grounds in Nechako River tributaries. To achieve specific downstream water temperature objectives during sockeye salmon migration each summer, a two-level outlet facility adjacent to Kenney Dam is to be constructed to release cooling water at 10°C to the Nechako River. Results of mathematical modelling of Nechako River water temperatures show that, based on specified design criteria, a maximum Kenney Dam release of 167 m 3 /s at 10°C would be required to meet the downstream water temperature objectives.

TI  - Locally defined measures of successful forest co-management : a case study of Tl'azt'en Nation and the John Prince Research Forest
TY  - thesis
AU  - Sarah Quinn
AB  - In Canada, First Nations rights and title to lands and resources have been recognized; however, reconciliation of land use conflicts has proven difficult. Co-management is emerging as a potential process for sharing authority between First Nations and others, though evaluative tools are required. This thesis builds on research by UNBC and Tl'azt'en Nation on adaptive forest co-management of the John Prince Research Forest. Through a case study, it presents a method for working with local First Nations to develop measures of co-management success. The method engages 'local experts' through a modified Nominal Group Technique, with an iterative, participatory approach. Results include a set of locally-defined measures on cultural revitalization, characteristics of effective Tl'azt'en measures, and a method evaluation. The method successfully engaged participants in generating effective measures, and constructive participant feedback was received. Implementation of a monitoring program by the John Prince Research Forest is required prior to complete evaluation.

TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Salmon Extracts Derived from Traditional First Nations Smoke Processing
TY  - web
AB  - Freshly caught salmon were hot smoked with the traditional smoke processing methods of the Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh First Nations communities, producing both half-smoked and fully smoked food products. To ascertain the nature of antimicrobial effects related to the smoking process, the residue content of 16 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and total PAHs of smoked products were determined and correlated with smoking process duration. When compared with fully smoked samples, partially smoked fish had significantly less total PAHs and were composed solely of low-molecular-weight components, with phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, and napthlalene, respectively, being the most abundant. In contrast, fully smoked products possessed significantly higher levels of low- and high-molecular-weight PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene. Sequential extractions of water, ethyl acetate, and hexane were performed to identify antimicrobial activity imparted by the traditional smoking process. No activity was observed in water or ethyl acetate extractions, whereas hexane extracts were inhibitory to Staphylococcus aureus, with more inhibition observed in fully smoked samples when compared with partially smoked samples. This study provides evidence that traditional smoke processing methods used by First Nations communities can provide value toward producing food products that have extended shelf lives, and protect against a prevalent common pathogen easily transmitted by humans to processed food through direct contact.

AB  - A 1987 Settlement Agreement between Alcan Aluminum Ltd., the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia, established a program (Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program) of ''measures'' to conserve salmon stocks in the Nechako River, Large-scale applications of several habitat measures are planned to offset the risks to chinook salmon caused by reductions in habitat quality associated with reduced flows and mid-summer temperatures. Experimental placement of debris refugia and introduction of inorganic nutrients were conducted from 1988 to 1991 in the upper river. Juvenile chinook salmon highly colonized stream-side debris structures, including rootwad-tree sweepers, floating cribs, pseudo-beaver lodges and debris catchers. Fry density was similar to that in natural woody debris cover, which is sparse in the river. Durability of the structures was low to moderate, except for debris catchers which readily withstood peak flows of 250-270 m(3).s(-1). Debris catchers were also more extensively utilized by young chinook during the rearing and migratory period in June. Mean numbers of chinook fry per structure during May, June and July (1991) were: debris catchers; 277, 522 and 40; debris bundles; 209, 85 and 17, respectively. By 1991 during June to July, most chinook fry counted along the margins of the 20-km study reach, inhabited the added debris structures. Adult rainbow trout also more extensively colonized debris structures than nonstructure sites along the river margins. An in-situ nutrient bioassay in the upper river demonstrated marked nitrogen deficiency and phosphorus co-limitation, with oligotrophic background levels at detection limits. Subsequent whole-river additions of 5-fold increases in inorganic N and P from May to July in 1989 (flow, 52 m(3).s(-1)) indicated that peak periphyton accrual, dominated by diatoms, increased an order of magnitude, and nutrient additions elevated periphyton accrual over large distances (50 km). High emigration of chinook fry confounded detection of a growth response. Debris structure placements were effective as salmonid cover, but it was unconfirmed if fertilization will augment the growth of young chinook in the upper Nechako River, as was confirmed earlier for juvenile coho salmon and steelhead trout at an oligotrophic coastal river.

AB  - BackgroundFactors associated with HCV incidence among young Aboriginal people in Canada are still not well understood. We sought to estimate time to HCV infection and the relative hazard of risk factors associated HCV infection among young Aboriginal people who use injection drugs in two Canadian cities. MethodsThe Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants’ venous blood samples were drawn and tested for HCV antibodies. Analysis was restricted to participants who use used injection drugs at enrolment or any of follow up visit. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of time to HCV seroconversion. ResultsIn total, 45 out of 148 participants seroconverted over the study period. Incidence of HCV infection was 26.3 per 100 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 16.3, 46.1) among participants who reported using injection drugs for two years or less, 14.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 7.7, 28.9) among participants who had been using injection drugs for between two and five years, and 5.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.6,10.9) among participants who had been using injection drugs for over five years. Independent associations with HCV seroconversion were involvement in sex work in the last six months (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 1.59; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.42) compared to no involvement, having been using injection drugs for less than two years (AHR: 4.14; 95% CI: 1.91, 8.94) and for between two and five years (AHR: 2.12; 95%CI: 0.94, 4.77) compared to over five years, daily cocaine injection in the last six months (AHR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.51, 4.05) compared to less than daily, and sharing intravenous needles in the last six months (AHR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.47, 4.49) compared to not sharing. ConclusionsThis study contributes to the limited body of research addressing HCV infection among Aboriginal people in Canada. The HCV incidence rate among Cedar Project participants who were new initiates of injection drug use underscores an urgent need for HCV and injection prevention and safety strategies aimed at supporting young people surviving injection drug use and sex work in both cities. Young people must be afforded the opportunity to provide leadership and input in the development of prevention programming.

AB  - Objective To measure the effectiveness of implementing the chronic care model (CCM) in improving HIV clinical outcomes. Design Multisite, prospective, interventional cohort study. Setting Two urban community health centres in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Participants Two hundred sixty-nine HIV-positive patients (18 years of age or older) who received primary care at either of the study sites. Intervention Systematic implementation of the CCM during an 18-month period. Main outcome measures Documented pneumococcal vaccination, documented syphilis screening, documented tuberculosis screening, antiretroviral treatment (ART) status, ART status with undetectable viral load, CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL, and CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL while not taking ART compared during a 36-month period. Results Overall, 35% of participants were women and 59% were aboriginal persons. The mean age was 45 years and most participants had a history of injection drug use that was the presumed route of HIV transmission. During the study follow-up period, 39 people died, and 11 transferred to alternate care providers. Compared with their baseline clinical status, study participants showed statistically significant (P<.001 for all) increases in pneumococcal immunization (54% vs 84%), syphilis screening (56% vs 91%), tuberculosis screening (23% vs 38%), and antiretroviral uptake (47% vs 77%), as well as increased viral load suppression rates among those receiving ART (72% vs 90%). Stable housing at baseline was associated with a 4-fold increased probability of survival. Aboriginal ethnicity was not associated with better or worse outcomes at baseline or at follow-up. Conclusion Application of the CCM approach to HIV care in a marginalized, largely aboriginal patient population led to improved disease screening, immunization, ART uptake, and virologic suppression rates. In addition to addressing underlying social determinants of health, a paradigm shift away from an "infectious disease" approach to a "chronic disease management" approach to HIV care for marginalized populations is strongly recommended.

AB  - Additions of inorganic N and P to replicated stream mesocosms were used to test the hypothesis that production of the benthic food web in the flow-controlled Nechako River, B.C., was N and P limited. N, P, and N + P additions were contrasted with controls to determine the responses of periphyton and macroinvertebrates over a 33-day period in late spring. Periphyton accrual under N + P addition was greater than two times that of the controls, and N alone produced a moderate increase. Periphyton showed relatively little response to P addition compared with controls. Macroinvertebrates, especially orthocladiine midges and mayflies, increased in density under N or N + P additions, in contrast with P additions and controls. Increased emergence rates of adult aquatic insects from the mesocosms were consistent with increases observed in benthic invertebrates. The results showed nutrient Limitation of benthic productivity and that algal and benthic invertebrate responses were closely coupled. N was most Limiting, but with additions of inorganic N as low as 10 mu g . L-1, P became limiting. The benthic invertebrates that increased most in abundance corresponded to the predominant prey in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry diets at the time of the experiment.

AB  - The addition of 540 MW of hydroelectric generating capacity to the Nechako Reservoir involves the increased diversion of water from the headwaters of the Nechako River in the Fraser River drainage to the Kemano River on the Pacific coast. Approval of the project requires a two level release structure at Kenney Dam at the head of the Nechako Canyon to manage downstream flows and water temperatures to conserve and protect chinook and sockeye populations. Two- and three-dimensional mathematical models were used to evaluate the hydrothermal characteristics of the Nechako Reservoir and to assess the capability of the proposed structure to provide releases necessary to meet downstream objectives. Results of the modelling show that deep water intake temperatures are sensitive to reservoir surface elevation and the deep water intake elevation. Modelling results for maximum release of 200 m3/s show that the deep water intake invert should be located at an elevation of 795 m to ensure water temperature criteria are met. The three dimensional modelling showed that little, if any additional bottom water mixing beyond that indicated by the two dimensional results for a nearby lake is likely to occur as a result of the Kenamo completion project. Extreme condition analysis shows that there exists sufficient volumes of cold water in the Nechako reservoir to ensure that the 10 degree C water release criteria can be met for the required period

AB  - With its entry into Confederation, British Columbia assumed jurisdiction over public lands ("assumed" may have a double meaning given the Supreme Court's 2014 Tsilhqot'in decision) through section 92 (5) of the Constitution Act, while the federal government undertook responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" under section 91 (24). Governmental conduct of Indigenous relations was further guided by Article 13 of the Terms of Union Act, which committed the Dominion to "a policy as liberal as that hitherto pursued" by colonial governments, supported by a concomitant provincial obligation for periodic transfer of public lands to the Dominion in pursuit of that goal.6 Those arrangements quickly brought competing provincial and federal approaches to "the Indian land question" into overt conflict. The Cheslatta and Ingenika bands were both abruptly uprooted from their homes and reserve lands by the Kemano and W.A.C. Bennett dams, respectively.7 Persistence of policy and prejudice during the period was reflected in two core themes: first, that Indigenous interests were subordinate to governmental interests (replacement of reserves lost to flooding was at best an afterthought, a cursory legal obligation to be fulfilled after substantive resource development decisions had been made);8 second, that government knew best what was good for Indigenous people (what the latter needed or wanted was irrelevant or inconsequential). 96 L.E.

AB  - This report assesses temperature and flow management options in the upper and lower Nechako system with reference to the needs of resident and migratory fish species. The goals of this report are to assess the success of the existing water management scheme in terms of moderating high summer water temperature in the Nechako upstream of the Stuart confluence; to consider the effects of the existing management scheme on temperature in the Nechako downstream of the Stuart confluence and to assess the overall effect on sockeye salmon that migrate through the Nechako upstream and downstream of the Stuart confluence; to introduce a model that examines the downstream consequences of possible future release scenarios if a Kenney Dam release facility were constructed.--Document.

AB  - For the past 20 years First Nations leaders of northern British Columbia have been advocating for a Social Work program that would address the unique needs of First Nations communities. This is not surprising given the historical destruction of First Nations families and communities as a result of colonization. Many would argue that current child welfare practices continue on where residential schools left off in implementing government assimilation policies. Approximately 30% of all children in care in Canada are Aboriginal (Fournier and Crey, 1998). This is no different in British Columbia. In the northern half of the province the number of Aboriginal children in continuing care is as high as 80% (Children's Commission Annual Report, 1998). The need for culturally sensitive child welfare practices is critical to First Nations communities and families. With the opening of a new northern university in 1992, University of Northern British Columbia, there was a renewed hope by northern First Nations leaders for a Social Work program that would meet their needs as well as support their vision for a future of self sufficiency and independence. This paper describes one small step in that vision, that is, the development of First Nations Social Work courses. To better understand this development process it is first important to be aware of the context in which it was undertaken.

AB  - Flooding events can have significant impacts, in terms of both loss of life and property damage. Analyzing floods to understand their processes and patterns improves our ability to predict when floods will occur. Under changing climate conditions, this will become even more important. The utility of an alternative approach to conventional flood analysis was investigated in a regulated river system with a reservoir, the Nechako River Basin located in British Columbia, Canada. Using the 1955–2008 daily discharge measured on the Nechako River discharge and its major tributaries, a random forest model was constructed to evaluate the relative importance of contributing discharges to the main stem during significant flood events in the downstream community of Prince George. Discharges from the unregulated Stellako and Nautley Rivers were found to be the most important variables during a spring flood. Conversely, during a winter flood, the regulated Skins Lake Spillway and the Kemano Powerhouse discharges were found to be the most important variables in the model. During periods of no flood, the main stem Nechako River at Isle Pierre discharge was the most important. This work provides a novel source of evidence that flow regulation on the Nechako River is an important indicator of downstream winter flood conditions in Prince George, potentially exacerbating ice jams and/or causing significant property damage and economic losses.

SN  - 0834177X
AB  - Despite recent setbacks, like the Feb. 4 Supreme Court of Canada decision not to get involved in the dispute, [Justa Monk] has vowed to continue his decadelong fight against Alcan's Kemano Completion Project (Kemano 2). Monk's tribal council, based in Prince George, consists of 10 Indian bands, including the Cheslatta Carrier Nation. Monk knows the Cheslatta story well and he also knows the Kemano project poses a real threat to the survival of his people.In 1987 Alcan and the governments of B.C. and Canada reached a secret deal on the Nechako's water. They decided Alcan could have 87 per cent for its Kemano 2 project, while the people along the river and the wildlife, waterfowl and fish could have 13 per cent. The people were shut out of this deal six years ago and they've been shut out every year since, by one secret deal after another. It's time for the secrecy to stop and it's time for the truth about the full impacts of the Kemano projects to come out - before Alcan is allowed to put another spade to the ground. The planned provincial review falls short.To give [Bill Clinton] a better understanding of Kemano 2, Monk sent him a copy of the excellent 25 - page chapter on the Nechako from Mark Hume's book The Run of the River. In it Hume, an award - winning writer, quotes Dr. Don Alderdice, who for years has valiantly expressed his concerns about Kemano 2. Alderdice, a retired salmon physiologist, who worked for the Department of Fisheries and Oceans for 49 years, has studied the project in depth. His conclusion: "The Kemano Completion flows are going to be disastrous, absolutely catastrophic."

AB  - Between 1908 and 1912, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway appropriated reserve land possessed by the Lheidli T'enneh Band at Fort George (now Prince George), B.C., offering $68 000, and ultimately paying $125 000, for land it later sold for more than $1 million. Band members were pressured by missionary clergy and the Department of Indian Affairs, to surrender the reserve to the railway swiftly and, from the perspective of the company, cheaply. Resistance by the band to the surrender did, however, result in temporarily stalled negotiations and a marked increase in compensation. The surrender or "sale" of Reserve No. 1 is illustrative of the broader phenomenon of the transfer of aboriginal reserve land to national railways, justified by the perceived benefit of the railway to the progress and development of Canada, and by the alleged benefit of relocation and isolation of the Lheidli T'enneh to their ultimate assimilation into Canadian society.

AU  - Scarge, B. L.
AB  - A comprehensive review of water management practices in the Nechako River Basin in British Columbia was provided. The Nechako Reservoir System is an important component of the Kemano hydroelectric power generation project which is owned by Alcan Smelters and Chemicals Ltd. Particular attention was focused on the events and circumstances that resulted in ice jams and flooding in down-stream communities from the Nechako Reservoir in the fall of 1996, which has become the source of considerable public concern. Reservoir management practices regarding energy production, fisheries resource protection, flood protection and recreational use, were reviewed. The roles and responsibilities of those responsible for reservoir operations were analyzed and the water management of the reservoir during 1996 was assessed. Recommendations were made to help strengthen the reservoir operating practices.

TI  - Remembering forward : navigating the everyday of forced displacement with the Cheslatta T'en
TY  - thesis
AU  - Wikler, Maia
AB  - Development in British Columbia has and continues to operate within an extractivist, colonial framework with little regard to environmental or community impacts. In 1952, the Cheslatta T’En were forcibly removed from their homelands for Alcan’s Kenney Dam. Because of the frequent flooding of Nechako Reservoir, the Cheslatta live in constant tension with a permanently changed landscape as the bones of their ancestors and memories of their way of life continues to wash ashore. The coordinated and intentional efforts of Alcan and the Department of Indian Affairs to remove all material traces of the Cheslatta from their lands had devastating impacts that reach into their ancestral past, continue in the present, and shape Cheslatta’s collective action for a more just future. The Cheslatta’s memories of their lands and forced displacement are the traces that Alcan and the settler state could not erase. Today, with approximately 140 band members resettled onto eleven different reserves, totaling 1,400 hectares and scattered over 170 miles apart, the Cheslatta navigate resettlement and efforts to reclaim their heritage in a land and space disconnected from what had been their homelands for thousands of years. Through an ethnohistorical and ethnographic analysis, I investigate the following: How are acts of resistance to displacement and dispossession informed by cultural meanings and memories of the land? What are the everyday experiences of dispossession and displacement? How do community members navigate “moving forward”? In this thesis, I analyze the individually narrated experiences of displacement; observations of reconciliation negotiations; community gatherings; Cheslatta community members’ interactions with the landscape; and, archival documents. My analysis coincides with theoretical frameworks of memory, space and place, and settler state reconciliation politics.

AB  - Water temperature is actively being monitored along the regulated Nechako River and some of its unregulated tributaries in northern British Columbia (BC) to determine how climate variability, climate change and flow regulation influence water temperatures. The Nechako Watershed, located mainly in the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone, spans 47,200 km(2) in area [1]. The regional climate experiences a prominent seasonal cycle in air temperature and precipitation, with subfreezing temperatures and snow accumulating during winter. Waterways therefore experience extended near 0 degrees C water/ice temperatures during the winter season. The accumulation of snow yields snowmelt-generated peaks in discharge during the spring freshet period in unregulated tributaries [2]. Regional studies on climate reveal recent warming trends that are anticipated to persist through the 21st century, with a projected mean air temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C by the 2050's [3]. In response to warming air temperatures, regional water temperatures are also on the rise, with an average warming trend of 0.7 degrees C from 1950 to 2015 [4]. Changing water temperatures are important in understanding ecological and environmental impacts on riverine systems, including aquatic species such as fish (e.g., sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), all endemic species to the Nechako Watershed), invertebrates, and microorganisms. Managing water temperatures during the fish spawning season is crucial as elevated temperatures induce stress and affect reproduction success [5]. Starting with a pilot project in summer of 2019, we expanded in situ monitoring of water temperature to 29 sites; however, for the purposes of this paper, only data from 24 sites are included (some sites have limited data samples or loggers could not be retrieved in the field). Currently, 25 sites are fully operational and collecting data, all deployed to sample and record data at 15-minute intervals starting at the top of the hour. Site data collection occurs at minimum once annually (typically during summer/early fall), along with site and logger maintenance. Field notes are taken to identify any potential issues with data collection, such as loggers dewatering during low flows, duration of logger removal for data collection, and any other environmental concerns that should later be considered during data analysis. The assembled data are useful to build long-term time series of observed water temperatures within the Nechako Watershed and as a baseline for future projects. The data are also used to determine the effectiveness of the Summer Temperature Management Program at the Nechako Reservoir and Skins Lake Spillway [1]. Therefore, these data can be used in the future to better identify the optimal discharge from the reservoir to minimize ecological effects on the watershed. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Canfor's Prince George Pulp & Paper Mill in Prince George, BC, Canada operates a bleach plant effluent system for the production of Bleached Kraft Pulp. The original underground fiberglass reinforced pipe (FRP) presents an elevated risk to both environment and production targets. Over the past five years there have been over 10 repairs required to maintain integrity of the pipeline. The primary objective of the project was to create a more reliable pipeline and reduce the risk of a major leak event and subsequent consequences. With temperatures up to 75 degrees C, standard PE4710 materials were not suitable for this application. A brand new Polyethylene of Raised Temperature Resistance (PE-RT) pipe that expands the use of Polyethylene (PE) pipe into larger diameter industrial applications allowing continuous operating range from -45 degrees C to 82 degrees C with intermittent temperatures up to 95 degrees C was selected to replace the underground fiberglass piping.

AB  - The John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) was established as a co-managed forest between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, as an opportunity for these partners to blend their respective ways of understanding and managing forests to contribute to ecological and social sustainability. Using four criteria of successful co-management reported in the literature as critical to the early stages of partnership — partnership building, institutional structure, decision-making, and capacity — we discuss the JPRF's performance during the first half-decade of its existence. The JPRF's early experience provides an example of the evolution of a co-management relationship that, while facing constraints and challenges in regard to some of the criteria, has provided the foundation for a strong future partnership.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Indigenous leaders and child and family advocates are deeply concerned about the health impacts of the child welfare system, including HIV vulnerability. The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of having been apprehended into the child welfare system and associated HIV vulnerabilities among young Indigenous people who use drugs. METHODS: The Cedar Project is a cohort of young Indigenous people ages 14–30 years who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. Multivariable logistic regression modeling determined associations between a history of involvement in the child welfare system and vulnerability to HIV infection. RESULTS: Of 605 participants, 65% had been taken from their biological parents. Median age of first apprehension was 4 years old. Having been sexually abused, having a parent who attended residential school and being HIV-positive were all independently associated with having been involved in the child welfare system. Participants who had been involved in the child welfare system were also more likely to have been homeless, paid for sex, diagnosed and hospitalized with mental illness, self-harmed, thought about suicide, and attempted suicide. Among participants who used injection drugs, those who had been involved in child welfare were more likely to have shared needles and overdosed. CONCLUSION: This study has found compelling evidence that young Indigenous people who use drugs in two cities in BC are experiencing several distressing health outcomes associated with child welfare involvement, including HIV infection. Jurisdictional reforms and trauma-informed programs that use culture as intervention are urgently needed.

Most of the ages cluster around 138 m.y. but some are as old as 155 m.y. and one is only 114 m.y. These data might indicate either one protracted perhaps intermittent magmatic event culminating in early Upper Jurassic or three separate and unrelated events. In either case the isotopic age is some 40 m.y. less than the age previously assigned to the Topley Intrusions on a basis of apparently good geological evidence., non disponible

Most of the ages cluster around 138 m.y. but some are as old as 155 m.y. and one is only 114 m.y. These data might indicate either one protracted perhaps intermittent magmatic event culminating in early Upper Jurassic or three separate and unrelated events. In either case the isotopic age is some 40 m.y. less than the age previously assigned to the Topley Intrusions on a basis of apparently good geological evidence., non disponible

AB  - Two-dimensional (2-D) models of audio and broadband magnetotelluric (MT) data collected throughout the southern Nechako basin in south-central British Columbia, Canada, provide electrical resistivity images of the Cretaceous to Oligocene volcanic and sedimentary packages and underlying crustal-scale features. Analysis of distortion effects and structural dimensionality indicate that the MT responses are primarily one-dimensional (1-D) at periods less than 0.1 s. Departures from a 1-D response occur with maximum phase differences occurring between 0.1 and 10 s. The upper crustal resistivity models reveal a low resistivity layer at near surface depths, interpreted as Chilcotin basalts, that blankets portions of the region to depths less than 50 m, but locally thicken up to 200 m. Cretaceous sedimentary units (those showing the highest potential for hydrocarbons) are characterized by moderately low resistivities that are laterally variable. More uniform, lower resistivities appear to be associated with the Eocene volcaniclastic groups, suggesting that the MT method can distinguish between these units and may be useful in targeting areas that are more prospective for hydrocarbon exploration. In general midcrustal resistivity values are high, consistent with values of typical volcanic terranes; however, a low-resistivity zone is identified at 8 - 10 km depth that correlates closely with the location of seismic reflectors as well as recent microseismic activity. This low-resistivity zone is interpreted as a midcrustal reservoir of magma, the top of which marks the upper limit of fluids migrating from lower crust depths. Additionally, several crustal-scale faults are imaged. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Introduction: To help address physician shortages in the underserved community of Prince George, Canada, the University of British Columbia (UBC) and various partners created the Northern Medical Program (NMP), a regional distributed site of UBC's medical doctor undergraduate program. Early research on the impacts of the NMP revealed a high degree of social connectedness. The objective of the present study was to explore the role of social capital in supporting the regional training site and the benefits accrued to a broad range of stakeholders and network partners.; Methods: In this qualitative study, 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with community leaders in 2007. A descriptive content analysis based on analytic induction technique was employed. Carpiano's Bourdieu-based framework of 'neighbourhood' social capital was adapted to empirically describe how social capital was produced and mobilized within and among networks during the planning and implementation of the NMP.; Results: Results from this study reveal that the operation of social capital and the related concept of social cohesion are multifaceted, and that benefits extend in many directions, resulting in somewhat unanticipated benefits for other key stakeholders and network partners of this medical education program. Participants described four aspects of social capital: (i) social cohesion; (ii) social capital resources; (iii) access to social capital; and (iv) outcomes of social capital.; Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the partnerships and networks formed in the NMP planning and implementation phases were the foundation for social capital mobilization. The use of Carpiano's spatially-bounded model of social capital was useful in this context because it permitted the characterization of relations and networks of a tight-knit community body. The students, faculty and administrators of the NMP have benefitted greatly from access to the social capital mobilized to make the NMP operational. Taking account of the dynamic and multifaceted operation of social capital helps one move beyond a view of geographic communities as simply containers or sinks of capital investment, and to appreciate the degree to which they may act as a platform for productive network formation and expansion.

AB  - Seismic inversion is applied to generate physical property models (P-wave velocity and numerical attenuation) for four profiles in the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau region of south-central British Columbia, Canada. A newly developed method that combines three-dimensional (3-D) travel-time inversion and 2.5-dimensional (2.5-D) viscoacoustic full-waveform inversion was applied to generate the geophysical models from vibroseis data acquired along the preexisting crooked roads. These models are useful for the characterization of rock types in terms of their positions and thicknesses, which may be used in conjunction with geological ground truth to infer the extent of lithostratigraphic units in the subsurface. The velocity structures also may be used for future reprocessing of the seismic reflection data to derive improved images based on the better near-surface velocity models. The subsurface geology of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau region is complex, resulting from multiple stages of tectonic compression and extension, contemporaneous with the deposition of sediments and volcanic material. Several basin structures are identified from the joint interpretation of the waveform tomography velocity models and post-stack time migration images. The combination of these results enables the extrapolation and characterization of geological structures to ~3 km depth, particularly within the Cenozoic volcanic units that dominate near-surface stratigraphy. Based on the seismic profiles, a fence-diagram geological interpretation that extends to ~3 km depth illustrates the complex structure of the Jurassic to Neogene stratigraphic sequence.

AB  - Objectives. Aboriginal leadership and families are deeply concerned about the rate of suicide attempt among their young people. The objectives of this study were to (a) describe the prevalence of suicide attempt and (b) to describe correlates of vulnerability to suicide attempts within a cohort of young Aboriginal people who use drugs in 2 Canadian cities. We aimed to situate the findings within the context of historical and lifetime trauma. Study design. The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving 605 young Aboriginal people aged 14–30 who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, Canada.Methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling identified independent predictors of suicide attempts. Estimates of adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated.Result. In multivariable analysis, residing in Prince George (Adjusted Odds Ratio [AOR]: 1.80, 95% CI: 1.23, 2.64), ever having been sexually abused (AOR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.39, 3.08), and ever having overdosed (AOR: 2.29, 95% CI: 1.53, 3.42) independently predicted lifetime attempted suicide.Conclusions. Suicide prevention and intervention programs must address historical and lifetime trauma among Aboriginal young people who struggle with substance dependence.

AB  - Caribou (Rangifer tarandus) living in the mountainous areas of British Columbia are usually classified as either northern caribou, which spend much of the winter in low-elevation relatively young forests foraging primarily on terrestrial lichens, or mountain caribou, which winter in high-elevation old subalpine forests foraging exclusively on arboreal lichens. The forest-management practices necessary to conserve caribou differ substantially between these two categories of animals with different life-history strategies. Because of this variability in winter-habitat use, information relating specifically to Takla Lake caribou was required for forest management. To provide this information, we radio-collared 15 female caribou in two subherds in the vicinity of Takla Lake and determined their distribution and movements between January 1996 and May 1998 in relation to topography and vegetation cover. Habitat selection was examined using a classified satellite image. At the landscape scale, Takla Lake caribou ..., Les Caribous (Rangifer tarandus) qui vivent dans les zones montagneuses de la Colombie-Britannique sont généralement classifiés comme des caribous « du nord », où les animaux passent une bonne partie de l'hiver à basse altitude, dans des forêts relativement jeunes, se nourrissant surtout de lichens terrestres, ou alors comme des caribous « de montagne », où les animaux passent l'hiver à haute altitude, dans de vielles forêts subalpines, se nourrissant exclu- sivement de lichens arboricoles. Les pratiques de gestion nécessaires à la conservation des caribous varient considérable ment entre ces deux stratégies opposées. À cause de la variabilité dans l'utilisation de l'habitat en hiver et pour des fins de gestion, nous avons eu besoin d'informations concernant spécifiquement les caribous du lac Takla. Nous avons muni de colliers émetteurs 15 caribous femelles appartenant à deux sous-troupeaux vivant aux abords du lac Takla et avons étudié leur répartition et leurs déplacements de janvier 1996 à mai 1998 en ...

AB  - Changes in air temperature and precipitation can modify snowmelt-driven runoff in snowmelt-dominated regimes. This study focuses on climatic change impacts on the snow hydrology of the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. Statistically-downscaled forcing datasets based on 12 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) are used to drive the VIC model for two 30-year time periods, a historical baseline (1980-2009) and future projections (2040-2069: 2050s), under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5.The ensemble-based VIC simulations reveal widespread and regionally coherent spatial changes in snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE) and snowcover over the FRB by the 2050s. While the mean precipitation is projected to increase slightly, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is projected to decrease by nearly 50% in the 2050s compared to the baseline. Snow accumulation and snow covered area are projected to decline substantially across the FRB, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. Onset of springtime snowmelt in the 2050s is projected to be nearly 25 days earlier than historically, yielding more runoff in the winter and spring for the Fraser River at Hope, BC and earlier recession to low-flow volumes in summer. The ratio of snowmelt contribution to runoff decreases by nearly 20% in the Stuart and Nautley sub-basins of the FRB in the 2050s. The decrease in SWE and loss of snowcover is greater in low-to-mid, than high, elevations where temperature remain sufficiently cold for precipitation to fall as snow.

AB  - Across the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of British Columbia, the distribution of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, which are considered prospective for hydrocarbon exploration, is poorly known due to the surface cover of glacial deposits and Tertiary volcanic rocks. To constrain the subsurface distribution of these Cretaceous rocks, in 2008 Geoscience BC acquired seven long, up to 14.4 km, offset vibroseis seismic reflection lines across a north-northwest-trending belt of exhumed sedimentary rocks inferred to be part of the Taylor Creek Group. P-wave velocity models, which are consistent with sonic logs from nearby wells, have been estimated using three-dimensional first-arrival tomography to depths ranging from 1 to 4 km. Igneous basement can be identified on most lines using the 5.5 km/s isovelocity contour, which locates the top of the basement to an accuracy of similar to 400 m where its depth is known in exploration wells. There is no general distinction on the basis of seismic velocity between Cretaceous sedimentary and Paleocene-Eocene volcanic-volcaniclastic rocks, both of which appear to be characterized in the tomographic models by velocities of 3.0-5.0 km/s. The geometry of the igneous basement inferred from the velocity models identifies north-trending basins and ridges, which correlate with exposed rocks of the Jurassic Hazelton Group. Identified Cretaceous sedimentary rocks occur beneath less negative Bouguer gravity anomalies, but the original distribution of these rocks has been disrupted by later Tertiary extension that created north-trending basins associated with the most negative gravity anomalies. We suggest that Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, if deposited, could be preserved within these basins if the rocks had not been eroded prior to Tertiary extension.

AB  - In the BATHOLITHSonland seismic project, a refraction wide-angle reflection survey was shot in 2009 across the Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau of central British Columbia. Part of the seismic profile crossed the Nechako Basin, a Jurassic-Cretaceous basin with potential for hydrocarbons within sedimentary strata that underlies widespread volcanic rocks. Along this 205 km-long line segment, eight large explosive shots were fired into 980 seismometers. Forward and inverse modelling of the traveltime data were conducted with two independent methods: ray-tracing based modelling of first and secondary arrivals, and a higher resolution wavefront-based first-arrival seismic tomography. Material with velocities less than 5.0 km/s is interpreted as sedimentary rocks of the Nechako Basin, while velocities from 5.0-6.0 km/s may correspond to interlayered sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The greatest thickness of sedimentary rocks in the basin is found in the central 110 km of the profile. Two sub-basins were identified in this region, with widths of 20-50 km and maximum sedimentary depths of 2.5 and 3.3 km. Such features are well-defined in the velocity model, since resolution tests indicate that features with widths greater than similar to 13 km are reliable. Beneath the sedimentary rocks, seismic velocities increase more slowly with depth - from 6.0 km/s just below the basin to 6.3 km/s at similar to 17 km in depth, and then to 6.8-7.0 km/s at the base of the crust. The Moho is found at a depth of 33.5-35 km beneath the profile, and mantle velocities are high at 8.05-8.10 km/s.

AB  - We used electromyogram (EMG) radiotelemetry to assess swimming activity (e.g., swim speeds), behaviour, and migration speeds (e.g., ground speeds) of individual adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrating through several reaches of the Fraser and Nechako rivers in British Columbia. Using a laboratory swim flume and volitionally swimming adult fish carrying EMG transmitters, we developed relationships between EMG pulse intervals and swim speeds. A bioenergetics model was used to estimate reach-specific energy use per metre for each individual based on the average swim speed, migration time, body size, and river temperature. Migration was most energetically efficient (i.e., migration costs per unit distance traveled were relatively low) for females compared with males, large males compared with small males, and 1995 males compared with 1993 males. In all three cases, differences in swim speed patterns were primarily responsible for differences in energy use. For both sexes and in both years, migrations through reaches that contained a constriction (caused by an island, gravel bar, or large rock outcropping) were energetically inefficient compared with that through reaches with no constrictions. The high energetic costs at constrictions seem to result from long travel times probably caused by turbulent flow patterns that may generate confusing migrational cues.

Samples were from four southwestern British Columbia (BC) locations, a reference site in northern BC (Fort St. James; FSJ), and from Santa Catalina Island, CA (SCI), an area of high DDT and PCB contamination. Mean concentrations of Sigma polybrominated diphenyl ether (Sigma PBDE (8 congeners monitored); 1.78-8.49 ng/g), Sigma OH-polychlorinated biphenyl (Sigma OH-PCB (30 congeners monitored); 0.44-0.87 ng/g), and Sigma OH- PBDE (14 congeners monitored; 0.31-0.92 ng/g) were similar in eaglets from southwestern BC yet lower than for SCI and significantly higher than for FSJ. Dominant PBDE congeners were BDE47, BDE99, and BDE100, but SCI eaglets also contained low levels of higher brominated congeners. 4-OH-CB187 and 4'-OH- CB202 accounted for 65-100% of Sigma OH-PCB in all BC eaglets, with 4'-OH-CB202 as well as 3'-OH-CB138 and 4-OH-CB146 dominating in SCI eaglets. Ostensibly of biogenic origin, 6'-OH-BDE49 and 6-OH-BDE47 were found in BC nestlings. Only 4'-OH-BDE49 (2.10 ng/g) was found in SCI eaglets. MeO-PBDEs and total hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were not found in any birds, but the polybrominated biphenyl BB101 was detected in southwestern BC samples. This study demonstrates that west coast North American bald eagles contain previously unreported organohalogens, which have the potential to impact the health and survival of these raptors.

AB  - Magnetically tagged particles were used to investigate the effects of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and floods on the dispersion of coarse bed material in the Stuart-Takla region, British Columbia, Canada. The dominant annual sediment transporting event in the channels is the snowmelt flood events, with lesser activity usually accomplished during summer floods. Annually in August, the channel bed material is reworked by the Early Stuart sockeye salmon spawning, as the fish excavate the streambed to deposit and bury their eggs. These nesting cavities are called redds. Results from 67 tracer recovery experiments over five years were highly variable, subject to the magnitude of floods and the returning population of salmon. Overall, the depositional pattern from nival flood events usually demonstrated a high degree of clast mobilization, long travel distances (up to 150 m), and mean depths of burial up to 18 cm. Summer flood events showed somewhat lower rates of mobilization, distances of travel, and depths of burial. Although the fish did not move the tracers very far, their effect on the bed was generally quite pervasive - up to 100 percent of the clasts were mobilized, and the depth of burial was considerable (mean burial depths up to 14 cm). The amount of vertical mixing of sediment by salmon was often on the same order of magnitude as flood events. The significant vertical mixing of sediments by the fish has important implications for the mobility of sediment in the stream. Since any armoring layer formed during high flows throughout the year is subject to the bioturbation of salmon, this suggests that the transport threshold in the creeks remains relatively low. Salmon likely play an integral role in the sediment transport. dynamics and annual sediment budget of the lower reaches of these creeks.

AB  - Purpose Sediment dynamics in most large river basins are influenced by a variety of different natural and anthropogenic pressures, and disentangling these cumulative effects remains a challenge. This study determined the contemporary and historical sources of fine-grained (< 63-mu m) sediment in a large, regulated river basin and linked changes in sources to activities in the basin. The river has seen declines in chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, and the endangered Nechako white sturgeon populations, and sediment (both fine-grained and sands) transport and deposition have been identified as potential causes of these declines. Materials and methods Samples of suspended sediment and potential source materials were collected from numerous sites distributed throughout the upper Nechako River Basin in British Columbia, Canada. A floodplain sediment core was also collected in order to reconstruct sediment sources over the last similar to 70 years. Discriminating fingerprint properties were used within the MixSIAR model to apportion sources among sub-basins and land-use types. Results were compared to records of precipitation and Nechako River discharge trends, and to changes in landscape development. Results and discussion Contributions from the erosion of channel banks dominated the suspended sediment load at most sites. Changes in sediment sources during the 2015 field season reflected snowmelt and patterns of water release from the Nechako Reservoir that affected the sediment-carrying capacity of tributaries and the Nechako River main stem. Spatial variations in 2015 also reflected the distribution of land use (e.g., forested or agricultural land) as well as topography (e.g., slope steepness). Over the last similar to 70 years, variations in sediment sources and the characteristics of the sediment (e.g., organic matter content and particle size composition) were linked to the construction of the Kenney Dam (operational in 1954) and the impacts of deforestation by the forestry and agricultural industries. Superimposed on these have been wildfires and a major mountain pine beetle infestation leading to higher erosion rates in the affected areas. Conclusions The sediment source fingerprinting technique, in combination with historical information on the hydrometeorology and the land use and river management in the basin, has provided valuable information with which to understand sediment dynamics in the Nechako River Basin. Such an approach can help to disentangle how large river systems respond to a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures.

AB  - While researching aspects of indigenous oral history in the western part of what is currently called Canada, I encountered an anecdote from a Southern Tutchone elder from the Yukon. This elder, Mrs. Annie Ned, was criticizing a group of scientists at a joint conference of scientists and indigenous persons involved in environmental issues facing the polar and sub-polar regions of Canada. She said to the scientists: 'You people talk from paper' (Cruikshank 1998: 45). In this essay I will discuss why and how this phrase functions as potent criticism of how western law and science deal with indigenous groups in settler colonial societies and, perhaps, how western law and science deal with knowledge in general. To do that I'll look at a case where two different kinds of legal tradition come into conflict-in part because of what each of them takes to be law's materials. The case is called Delgamuukw v. British Columbia (hereinafter Delgamuukw). The conflict is between Canada and two indigenous groups-the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en- residing in what is currently called British Columbia.

AB  - A Community Learning Centre (CLC) is an innovative model of delivering health care and health information based firmly on the idea of community engagement. It has two interrelated components: 1) a community-based facility with Internet-linked computers accessible to all community members; and 2) community developed web-based resources relevant to community defined needs and priorities. This article describes a pilot CLC implementation in a remote British Columbia First Nations community. A CLC supports the acquisition of health information as well as research and technology skills by facilitating access to, and uptake of, relevant resources developed by and for community members.

AB  - Digital story-telling is a counter-narrative of healing for many indigenous youth in Canada today. As much as e-health technologies are valuable and empowering an interventionist presumption limits the potential value of digital communication as a healing resource. With examples from three digital story-telling sites, we explore the internet as both a social space and therapeutic tool where indigenous youth are constructing and negotiating Aboriginality through online story sharing. Those digital stories, like other narrative forms, are part of a larger complex of contemporary forms of healing.

AB  - Whatever his motives, Wright in 1863 had boiler, machinery and fittings for the sternwheeler Enterprise packed by mules from Port Douglas at the head of Harrison Lake over the portages to Lillooet and up the wagon road to a point near Fort Alexandria upstream from Soda Creek. Victoria's skilled shipbuilder James Trahey was brought north to superintend construction, and steam was raised on 9 May. From 1863 to 1869 the Enterprise worked diligently and profitably throughout a long season on the Upper Fraser Route, but in the latter year she looked to be facing retirement when Wright replaced her with the larger, more powerful sternwheeler Victoria . The Omineca gold rush and Wright's questing nature however reprieved her from oblivion. Well aware of the transportation economies offered by steamboating, Wright determined to send the Enterprise with a supply of goods on a voyage of discovery to see if the Omineca country could be served by a water route. In 1871 she was taken through the Cottonwood and Fort George Canyons to Fort George, then up the Nechako to the Stuart River, up the Stuart to Stuart Lake, up Tachie River to Trembleur Lake, and then up Middle River and Takla Lake to Takla Landing, a feat never equalled in river navigation in British Columbia. Had the Omineca boom been more sustained, who knows what might have taken place in the way of steamboat development.

AB  - Small tenures diversify British Columbia?s forest tenure system and create new opportunities for local involvement in forest management. Held by local people and organizations, small tenures generate expectations that forest management will reflect a broad range of community values for forest use. Woodlot Licences and Community Forest Agreements (CFAs) are small, area-based, long-term licences that grant exclusive rights to manage and harvest timber on public land. Community Forest Agreements also include limited rights to botanical non-timber forest products. All tenures, whether large or small, carry rules established by the provincial forestry legislative and regulatory framework. Award and renewal of cfas is conditional upon demonstrating community support and receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range. Small tenures are growing in popularity, but account for only a tiny fraction of the provincial forest land base and allowable annual cut. Despite their size, there are big expectations that woodlots and community forests will introduce new ways of managing forests in British Columbia.

AB  - This article traces three years of progress related to building Aboriginal health research capacity with Aboriginal people, communities, and postsecondary institutions through the efforts of the BC Aboriginal Capacity and Developmental Research Environment (ACADRE) network. Extensive Aboriginal community consultations throughout BC resulted in the identification of seven community-determined research theme priorities: traditional healing, knowledge, and practices; addictions and mental health-treatment and transitions; health care programs and policy; health promotion and best practices; Elders' well-being; ethics-research and practice; and capacity-building in and access to research. Various research partnerships with Aboriginal community, health, and educational organizations resulted in the development of research awareness workshops, pilot studies, provincial forums to share research experiences, learning research modules, and the development of community-specific ethical protocols. A significant outcome of the BC ACADRE has been funding and mentoring support for numerous high school, undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students engaged in Aboriginal health education and research.

AB  - The Drunken Indian stereotype has a long history of expression across literary, scientific, sociological, and political discourses. This article traces the persistence and operative nature of its production and reproduction and argues that Eden Robinson's Monkey Beach challenges the stereotype through refiguring addiction as social suffering rather than individual — and racialized — pathology. By employing cartographic imagery, generational juxtaposition, and a first-person dual point of view that negotiates between spectral and spiritless worlds, Monkey Beach contextualizes habitual drinking as a response to alienation from cultural practices that are becoming increasingly threatened by ongoing colonial and capitalist policies of individualism and acculturation. The Haisla characters contend with the affective consequences of living in what Karl Marx calls a “coerced” and “forced labor” economy. Yet, because the forced transition to this mode of production is a relatively recent process within Indigenous histories — one that is violently and insidiously imposed, rather than always already installed — it has not become fully naturalized. Consequently, Robinson depicts addiction as engendered not only by historical trauma emergent from the dismantling of Indigenous lifeways connecting kinship, land, and spirituality, but also by the ideological and material conditions of capital. Ultimately, Robinson's novel betrays how the material conditions of late capitalism exacerbate colonial trauma, which manifests as social suffering, and extend colonialism’s acculturative shadow. As such, Monkey Beach re-signifies addiction as exposing the limits of full participation in a colonial and capitalist economy, precisely because of the cultural, economic, and spiritual violence on which such systems are predicated.

AB  - Studies on the naming and classification of plants by First Peoples of British Columbia began with the works of early ethnographers like Franz Boas. In the 1970s, however, research in this area became more focused in BC, following general trends in ethnobiology and cognitive anthropology in documenting systems of biological “folk taxonomy” in different cultures and languages worldwide. This research reflects collaboration with ethnobotanists, linguists and Indigenous speakers and knowledge holders of First Nations’ languages, and includes recording the names and conceptual relationships of plant species and other plant categories. Identification of factors influencing plant nomenclature and shaping plant classification systems, and how these systems have changed over time and vary from language to language, has been a focus of the research. Most BC First Nations languages incorporate names for between about 120 and 150 different species or basic “generic rank” categories of plants. These tend to be arranged in a shallow hierarchy within a small number of higher order plant categories, such as for “tree,” “bush,” “grass.” In some culturally important species, more detailed sub-categories, within the “generic” taxa, are distinguished with more specific names. The indigenous categories for plants reflected in BC Indigenous languages and cognitive systems reflect culturally important plants, most of which are highly visible and widespread.

AB  - The mountain pine beetle epidemic is changing British Columbia forests and watersheds at the landscape scale. Watersheds with dead-pine-leading stands in the Vanderhoof Forest District of central British Columbia are reported to have wet soils due to raised water tables. They report a conversion of summer logging ground (dry firm soil) to winter logging ground (wetter less firm soil), upon which forestry equipment operation is difficult or impossible before freeze-up. This paper outlines a project that explores this serious operational issue through the perspective of the hydrologic water balance. It aims to determine the spatial extent of wet ground areas and to provide operational guidance through the development of a model that can predict where wet ground may occur at the stand and watershed level. The watershed-level prediction described here will be based on risk indicators developed from available geographic information system data and aerial photographs, as well as local knowledge. Predictions will be qualified through field verification studies at representative stands within ranked watersheds. Preliminary results are presented.

AB  - This preliminary study examined the impact of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation and subsequent canopy mortality on ground snow accumulation and ablation in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands. During the winter of 2005–2006, meteorological and snow conditions were measured in three stands—dead, alive, and cleared—in Northern Interior British Columbia. Variations in measured snow conditions and meteorological data between stands were assessed. Data were used in an energy-balance model to calculate snow ablation in each stand and estimate effects on meltwater production. Results showed that the dead stand no longer behaved like an alive stand, but had not yet approached cleared stand conditions. Ablation rates in the dead stand remained similar to those in the alive stand, although accumulation was closer to that in the cleared stand. The combination of a low ablation rate and increased ground snow accumulation in the dead stand resulted in a lengthened period of snowpack disappearance. In the cleared stand, however, high ablation rates were sufficient to remove the thicker snowpack earlier than in the dead stand. A multi-year study is under way at a new research site to further quantify the relationship between beetle-kill and its effect on snowpack.

AB  - In anticipation of climate change, the community of Prince George, BC has taken steps towards adaptation of community infrastructure. An introductory summary of impacts on temperature, precipitation and streamflow was prepared by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) and presented at several workshops. From the workshops the implications of these changes were identified with feedback from senior city staff and planners and documented in a report, Climate Change in Prince George: Summary of Past Trends and Future Projections and will form the basis of the report Adapting to Climate Change in Prince George. Prince George is a city of roughly 77,000 inhabitants, built on a flood plain at the confluence of the Nechako and Upper Fraser rivers. During the winter of 2007-2008, Prince George experienced severe ice-related flooding when lands along the lower Nechako River were inundated causing extensive damage. The watersheds surrounding Prince George encompass the headwaters of the largest river in BC (the Fraser) and have been heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle. These factors make this region susceptible to climate change impacts, and maintaining water security in this region is a concern to both the residents of Prince George and the Province. Over the last century the city experienced an average warming trend of 1.3°C. In recent decades, Prince George has become warmer in the winter season and a greater percentage of precipitation has fallen as rain rather than snow. Future climate projections were used with an evaluation of uncertainty to allow planners, managers and engineers to better integrate this information and make informed decisions as they prepare to adapt. Annual temperatures in the region are projected to increase by an average of 1.6°C to 2.5°C over the next 50 years. Precipitation during this time is projected to increase by 3% to 10%, with increases occurring primarily in winter and decreases possibly occurring in summer. These precipitation and temperature changes will result in changes to streamflow timing and amount that depend on watershed location and type. PCIC partnered with a local resident and expert in adaptation to synthesize these findings and place them in the context of vulnerabilities particular to their community. PCIC has undertaken several similar assessments and has established that an integral part of the procedure is identifying a local champion who leads the effort of defining community needs and ensuring that the report addresses these issues. The champion facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer that is the first step in the complex and difficult process of engaging stakeholders with diverse needs and conflicting demands for limited water resources. Many organizations and user groups such as Rio Tinto Alcan, who regulate flow on the Nechako River, have a stake in water resource management in this north-central region of the Province.

AB  - Stochastic Dynamic Programming (SDP) is known to be an effective technique to find the optimal operating policy of hydropower systems. In order to improve the performance of SDP, this project evaluates the impact of re-updating the policy at every time step by using Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). We present a case study of the Kemano's hydropower system on the Nechako River in British Columbia, Canada. Managed by Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA), this system is subject to large streamflow volumes in spring due to important amount of snow depth during the winter season. Therefore, the operating policy should not only maximize production but also minimize the risk of flooding. The hydrological behavior of the system is simulated with CEQUEAU, a distributed and deterministic hydrological model developed by the Institut national de la recherche scientifique - Eau, Terre et Environnement (INRS-ETE) in Quebec, Canada. On each decision time step, CEQUEAU is used to generate ESP scenarios based on historical meteorological sequences and the current state of the hydrological model. These scenarios are used into the SDP to optimize the new release policy for the next time steps. This routine is then repeated over the entire simulation period. Results are compared with those obtained by using SDP on historical inflow scenarios.

AB  - Abstract: For generations, promoters of northern political and economic development have emphasized the importance of post-secondary education. These northern advocates have lamented the absence or narrow scope of post-secondary institutions in the North. Canada is the only Circumpolar Nation without an Arctic university, and there is ample evidence that the region and the country are much the poorer for the lack of northern research, education and training capacity. It is not that Canadian institutions have ignored the region. Northern tier community colleges have played key and innovative roles in responding to regional needs. Southern universities have, through a variety of undergraduate, graduate and professional outreach programs, provided some degree options in the North. The University of the Arctic represents an innovative circumpolar effort to address northern needs across the Circumpolar North. Focusing on the University of Northern British Columbia, which opened in 1994, this paper demonstrates how responsive, regionally-aware post-secondary institutions can have transformative effects on their host communities and regions, and deals with some of the controversies surrounding the opening of the university.

AB  - Canadian utilities continue to turn to hydro as an economical, reliable, renewable resource that can meet their customer's electricity needs. In 1992, construction and planning advanced on nine large hydro projects having the potential for adding nearly 12,000 MW to Canada's installed hydro capacity. New project activities span the country-from the Kemano Completion Project in British Columbia on the West Coast, to activity in Quebec's James Bay in the East, and in between Manitoba and Ontario. And while non-utility generators have taken center stage in the small hydro arena, Canada's provincially owned utilities are largely responsible for this large project development.

AB  - Background We sought to estimate the prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Aboriginal young people who use drugs and to identify risk factors associated with HCV infection in this population. Methods The Cedar Project is a longitudinal study involving Aboriginal young people living in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. Eligibility criteria include age from 14 to 30 years and self-reported use (smoking or injection) of illicit drugs (e.g., crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, heroin or other opiates, and cocaine) at least once in the month before enrolment. At each visit, participants completed a detailed questionnaire administered by an Aboriginal interviewer. For this analysis, we included information for 512 participants who were recruited between September 2003 and April 2005. Results Among the 512 participants, the prevalence of HCV infection was 34.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.6%–38.9%); the rates were similar in Prince George and Vancouver (34.5% and 35.0% respectively, p = 0.37). Among those who reported the use of injection drugs at baseline (n = 286), the prevalence of HCV infection was 59.4% (95% CI 53.8%–65.1%); the rate in this group was slightly higher in Prince George than in Vancouver (62.4% v. 57.1% respectively, p = 0.37). The prevalence was 3.5% among participants who reported smoking drugs (n = 226). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with HCV infection among participants who used injection drugs included daily injection of opiates (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.0–7.4), reuse of syringes (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.4), having at least 1 parent who attended residential school (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.4), female sex (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.4) and duration of injection drug use (per year) (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.5). The crude incidence rate of HCV infection was 10.6% and the incidence density estimate was 9.9 per 100 person-years in this cohort. Interpretation The prevalence of HCV infection was elevated among Aboriginal young people living in Prince George and Vancouver who use drugs. Culturally based prevention, treatment and harm-reduction programs are urgently needed in this population.

AB  - A systems analysis approach is being used to co-manage the 13,000-hectare John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in Central British Columbia. The JPRF is a working forest managed by the University of Northern British Columbia and Tl’azt’en Nation for the purposes of research, education, and training. Local criteria and indicators of social and ecological sustainability have been identified using a combination of social science and conventional forest management planning techniques. A scenario planning approach is used to facilitate the broad exploration of management alternatives. An analytical decision support tool has been employed to incorporate socio-economic, ecological and operational indicators into an integrated long-term management strategy for the forest. Initial results are presented, and approaches to implementation and monitoring are discussed.

AB  - Early Tertiary lavas and sediments were collected from two areas west and south of Prince George, British Columbia, and processed for K/Ar dating and palynoassemblages.Samples from Cheslatta Falls gave K/Ar dates of 36.5 and 37.7 Ma and yielded a palynoassemblage very similar to that from the Jackson Group in Alabama and Mississippi. This Late Eocene assemblage is interpreted as having developed in a humid subtropical environment, prior to a climatic cooling that, we believe, should be assigned to Early Oligocene time.The Tertiary lavas and sediments from the Nazko area, west of Quesnel, gave three Middle Eocene dates and over 60 species of palynomorphs. These correlate with other rocks and palynoassemblages of Kamloops Group equivalents that occur southward across the International Boundary and north to latitude 55°N. The paleoclimate was wet and in the range of very warm temperate to humid subtropical., Des échantillons de laves et de sédiments du Tertiaire précoce ont été recueillis dans deux régions localisées à l'ouest et au sud de Prince George, en Colombie-Britannique, pour être datés par K/Ar et pour l'étude des palynoassemblages.Les échantillons de Cheslatta Falls donnent des âges K/Ar de 36,5 et 37,7 Ma, et leur palynoassemblage ressemble de très près à celui du Groupe de Jackson présent en Alabama et au Mississippi.

AB  - The potential of data assimilation for hydrologic predictions has been demonstrated in many research studies. Watersheds over which multiple observation types are available can potentially further benefit from data assimilation by having multiple updated states from which hydrologic predictions can be generated. However, the magnitude and time span of the impact of the assimilation of an observation varies according not only to its type, but also to the variables included in the state vector. This study examines the impact of multivariate synthetic data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the spatially distributed hydrologic model CEQUEAU for the mountainous Nechako River located in British Columbia, Canada. Synthetic data include daily snow cover area (SCA), daily measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) at three different locations and daily streamflow data at the watershed outlet. Results show a large variability of the continuous rank probability skill score over a wide range of prediction horizons (days to weeks) depending on the state vector configuration and the type of observations assimilated. Overall, the variables most closely linearly linked to the observations are the ones worth considering adding to the state vector due to the limitations imposed by the EnKF. The performance of the assimilation of basin-wide SCA, which does not have a decent proxy among potential state variables, does not surpass the open loop for any of the simulated variables. However, the assimilation of streamflow offers major improvements steadily throughout the year, but mainly over the short-term (up to 5 days) forecast horizons, while the impact of the assimilation of SWE gains more importance during the snowmelt period over the mid-term (up to 50 days) forecast horizon compared with open loop. The combined assimilation of streamflow and SWE performs better than their individual counter-parts, offering improvements over all forecast horizons considered and throughout the whole year, including the critical period of snowmelt. This highlights the potential benefit of using multivariate data assimilation for streamflow predictions in snow-dominated regions.

AB  - Recent work demonstrated the value of water temperature forecasts to improve water resources allocation and highlighted the importance of quantifying their uncertainty adequately. In this study, we perform a multisite cascading ensemble assimilation of discharge and water temperature on the Nechako River (Canada) using particle ﬁlters. Hydrological and thermal initial conditions were provided to a rainfall-runoff model, coupled to a thermal module, using ensemble meteorological forecasts as inputs to produce 5 day ensemble thermal forecasts. Results show good performances of the particle ﬁlters with improvements of the accuracy of initial conditions by more than 65% compared to simulations without data assimilation for both the hydrological and the thermal component. All thermal forecasts returned continuous ranked probability scores under 0.8 °C when using a set of 40 initial conditions and meteorological forecasts comprising 20 members. A greater contribution of the initial conditions to the total uncertainty of the system for 1-dayforecasts is observed (mean ensemble spread = 1.1 °C) compared to meteorological forcings (mean ensemble spread = 0.6 °C). The inclusion of meteorological uncertainty is critical to maintain reliable forecasts and proper ensemble spread for lead times of 2 days and more. This work demonstrates the ability of the particle ﬁlters to properly update the initial conditions of a coupled hydrological and thermal model and offers insights regarding the contribution of two major sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in thermal forecasts.

AB  - This study examines the 1914-2015 runoff trends and variability for 136 rivers draining British Columbia's Coast and Insular Mountains. Rivers are partitioned into eastward and westward flowing rivers based on flow direction from the Coast Mountains. Thus, eastward and westward runoff trends and influence of topography on runoff are explored. Our findings indicate that rivers flowing eastward to the Nechako and Chilcotin plateaus contribute the lowest annual runoff compared to westward rivers where runoff is high. Low interannual runoff variability is evident in westward rivers and their alpine watersheds, whereas eastward rivers exhibit high interannual runoff variability. On Vancouver Island, some of the rivers with the highest annual runoff exhibit high interannual variability. A significant (p < .05) negative correlation exists between mean annual runoff (R-m) and latitude, gauged area, mean elevation, and its corresponding coefficient of variation. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the glacierized area of mountainous regions and Rm. The mean coefficient of variation in annual runoff is significantly negatively correlated with latitude and glacierized area, but significantly positively correlated with longitude. Annual and seasonal runoff trend analyses of each river were performed for an early (1936-2015), a middle (1966-2015), and a late (1986-2015) period using the Mann-Kendall test. Trend analyses revealed a shift towards more positive detectable (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) trends in annual and seasonal runoff from the middle to the late period across the study domain. Most positive detectable seasonal runoff trends in the middle period occur in spring in glacierized westward rivers located > 1,200 m, whereas in the late period, they all occur in fall and are regionally coherent around Vancouver Island and south coastal BC. Rivers draining eastward exhibit more positive trends over 1986-2015 compared to westward rivers. This study provides crucial information on the hydrology of mountain watersheds across British Columbia's coast in response to Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase changes, the elevational amplification of regional climate change, and their influences on precipitation and glacier retreat.

AB  - The heart of the traditional legal order of the Lake Babine Nation of north-central British Columbia is the grand ceremonial feast known as the balhats, or potlatch. Misunderstood and widely condemned as a wasteful display of pride, the balhats ceremonies were outlawed by the Canadian government in the late nineteenth century. Throughout the years that followed, the Lake Babine Nation struggled to adapt their laws to a changing society while maintaining their cultural identity. Although the widespread feasting and exchange practices of the balhats have attracted continuous academic and political interest since the nineteenth century, little consideration has been given to understanding the legal practices embedded within the ceremonies. Cis dideen kat, the only book ever written about the Lake Babine Nation, describes the customary legal practices that constitute "the way." Authors Jo-Anne Fiske and Betty Patrick use historical and contemporary data to create a background against which the changing relations between the Lake Babine Nation and the Canadian state are displayed and defined, leading to the current era of treaty negotiations and Aboriginal self-government. Through interviews with community chiefs and elders, oral histories, focus groups, and archival research, Fiske and Patrick have documented and defined a traditional legal system still very much misunderstood. Their findings include material not previously published, making this book essential reading for those involved in treaty negotiations as well as for those with an interest in Aboriginal and state relations generally.

AB  - In recent decades, community forestry has taken root across Canada. Locally run initiatives are lauded as welcome alternatives to large corporate and industrial logging practices, yet little research has been done to document their tangible outcomes or draw connections between their ideals of local control, community benefit, ecological stewardship, and economic diversification and the realities of community forestry practice. This book brings together the work of over twenty-five researchers to provide the first comparative and empirically rich portrait of community forestry policy and practice in Canada. Tackling all of the forestry regions from Newfoundland to British Columbia, it unearths the history of community forestry, revealing surprising regional differences linked to patterns of policy-making and cultural traditions. Case studies celebrate innovative practices in governance and ecological management while uncovering challenges related to government support and market access. The future of the sector is also considered, including the role of institutional reform, multiscale networks, and adaptive management strategies.

AB  - Abstract Over 14 million hectares of lodgepole pine-dominated forests in British Columbia (BC), Canada, have been severely impacted by the current mountain pine beetle epidemic. Simultaneously, a Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in northwest BC has been responsible for killing thousands of hectares of pine plantations and has even resulted in the death of mature trees, which is unprecedented. Both of these globally significant forest pest epidemics have been linked to climate change. The beetle epidemic has grossly exceeded the scale of all previously recorded outbreaks, in large part due to a lack of cold winters. In this sense, the link to global warming is relatively straightforward and foreseeable. Of all climate change projections, the prediction of an increase in winter temperatures has been associated with as high a degree of confidence as any. The Dothistroma needle blight epidemic and its link to climate change were not so predictable. Based on weather records over the past four decades, short-term increases in mean summer precipitation correlate closely with historical records of Dothistroma outbreaks in the northwest. The current most severe outbreak has occurred during a prolonged period of above-average summer precipitation. An increase in summer precipitation would more typically be thought of as beneficial for forests, but that increase in moisture has improved the conditions for a pathogen that has outweighed any benefits. Similar trends of increasing incidence and severity for other forest pathogens in BC appear in areas that have been receiving increased summer precipitation. Conversely, in the southern interior of the province decreased summer precipitation and increased drought conditions are resulting in stressed trees which can favour root diseases. Early indications are that climate change will have profound effects on forest health. Some effects will be more predictable than others.

AB  - Background: Inappropriate allergy labelling is associated with significant clinical and pharmacoeconomic implications. Detailed antimicrobial allergy assessments represent a key component of antimicrobial stewardship and aid in identifying true type I (immediate hypersensitivity) reactions. The allergy history form currently used at the University Hospital of Northern British Columbia (UHNBC), in Prince George, relies on the assessor's ability to ask appropriate prompting questions to obtain a thorough history, but it may not be sufficient to accurately identify true allergies. Objective: To compare a standardized allergy history questionnaire and the current allergy history form in terms of the quality and quantity of documentation gathered. Methods: This prospective observational study involved patients who were admitted to medical and surgical services at UHNBC from November 2018 to January 2019 with a penicillin-class allergy reported on their electronic medical record (EMR). A list of patients with EMR-reported allergies was generated by the hospital's health information software system, and these patients were interviewed using the standardized allergy history questionnaire. Results: A total of 48 patients were assessed during the study period. Nineteen (40%) of the patients had an inappropriate allergy label on their EMR. Only 36 (75%) had an allergic reaction described on their EMR. Furthermore, only 36 (75%) of the 48 patients had the same allergy recorded on the EMR and on the allergy history form contained in their paper chart, of whom 22 had a documented reaction. The mean time to complete the standardized allergy history questionnaire was 2 minutes. Conclusions: At the study institution, documentation of allergy histories was often incomplete. Detailed allergy assessments are the first step in identifying true immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Utilization of a standardized allergy history questionnaire is feasible and may serve to improve documentation and overall antimicrobial stewardship.

AB  - Seasonal changes in crime have been documented since the mid-1800s, but no definitive consensus has been reached regarding universal annual patterns. Researchers also tend to focus on a single city over a particular time period, and, due to methodological differences, studies can often be difficult to compare. As such, this study investigates the seasonal fluctuations of crime across eight cities in British Columbia, Canada, between 2000 and 2006. Uniform Crime Report data, representing four crime types (assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and break and enter) were used in negative binomial or Poisson count models and regressed against trend, weather, and illumination variables. Results suggest that temperature changes impacted assault levels, few weather variables affected the occurrence of robberies, and fluctuations in property crime types were variable across the cities. Moreover, rain and snow had a deterrent effect on crime in cities that were not used to such weather conditions. These findings i...

AB  - Prologue Five years ago we heard three anecdotes about the small town of Burns Lake in northern British Columbia that whetted our phronetic research appetite, as well as our evolving interest in film as a mode of inquiry and a way of approaching collaborative and transformational planning. This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006.

AB  - This study examines the politics of Aboriginal title in British Columbia in the context of the approval process for the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal. We highlight presentations made by First Nations representatives and individuals during the Community Hearings for Oral Evidence stage of the Joint Review Panel, as well as the political actions of First Nations governments, organizations, and individuals outside the hearings. Speakers from several different nations articulated common points with regard to territory, property, and place in support of a case for sovereignty. Building from Aboriginal political theory, we argue that the evidence supports a reading of Aboriginal positions on the pipeline as a politics of refusal, the starting point of which lies within Aboriginal knowledge and governance systems, and not mere reaction to the development proposal. We hope to see more critical geographies of natural resource development incorporate Aboriginal theory into their frameworks. La politique du refus : la souveraineté autochtone et l'oléoduc Northern Gateway Cette étude s'intéresse aux questions politiques portant sur les droits territoriaux des Autochtones en Colombie-Britannique qui émergent du processus d'approbation du projet d'oléoduc Northern Gateway. Nous proposons un survol des différents exposés des représentants et individus des Premières nations entendus lors de la phase des Audiences communautaires pour la présentation de la preuve orale de la Commission d'examen conjoint, ainsi que les actions politiques réalisées par des gouvernements, organisations et individus des Premières nations en parallèle aux audiences. Des conférenciers provenant de différentes nations ont fait ressortir les mêmes points en ce qui concerne le territoire, la propriété et le lieu en démontrant le bien-fondé de la souveraineté. Prenant comme base la théorie politique autochtone, nous faisons valoir que les témoignages recueillis indiquent que les positions autochtones sur l'oléoduc s'inscrivent dans une politique du refus dont la source se trouve dans les systèmes de savoir et de gouvernance autochtone, et non dans une simple réaction à la proposition de projet. Il est souhaitable que la théorie autochtone occupe une place centrale dans les perspectives critiques en géographie du développement des ressources naturelles.

AB  - The present study developed from a pilot programme intended to test the usefulness of neutron activation analysis for determining sources of obsidian from sites near Anahim Lake, British Columbia. The scope has now been broadened to include materials from a larger number of sites in the Province, and determinations by X-ray fluorescence as well as neutron activation analysis are made. Following a list of relevant archaeological sites, the results are discussed first in terms of obsidian groupings and then relative to occurrence at each site. Comments on the results are provided by the author and by several of those who submitted samples. Cette recherche a été élaborée à partir d'une étude pilote visant à vérifier l'utilité des analyses par activation de neutrons pour déterminer l'origine de l'obsidienne provenant des sites du lac Anahim, en Columbie britannique. On a élargi les perspectives de cette recherche en y incluant du matériel provenant de plusieurs autres sites de la province, et en y ajoutant des analyses par fluorescence de rayons-X. Après la présentation d'une liste de sites significatifs, les résultats sont discutés par rapport à la distribution de l'obsidienne, puis par rapport à sa présence dans chaque site. Des commentaires sur les résultats obtenus sont fournis aussi bien par l'auteur que par plusieurs de ceux qui lui ont fourni des échantillons.

AB  - This paper examines whether environmental assessments (EAs) influence the ability of Aboriginal peoples to advance community employment aims in resource development projects. Environmental assessment and labour policy and practices have been conventionally understood as distinct processes. Our investigations demonstrate that EAs play a significant, if indirect, role in Aboriginal efforts to regulate resource sector work. While Aboriginal communities increasingly rely upon private negotiations with development proponents to secure resource sector employment, participation in EA processes provides Aboriginal peoples a space to negotiate language around employment commitments and leverage to secure Aboriginal employment provisions in impact benefit agreements with project proponents.

AB  - Sometime in the spring of 2022, several Nechako River First Nations hope the British Columbia, Canada Supreme Court will rule in their favor in a lawsuit against Rio Tinto Alcan Inc. that would address their concerns about the health of the river. But they are also hoping for a compromise that would restore river flows to the Nechako without having to remove the Kenney Dam and shut down Rio Tinto's BC Works aluminum smelter in Kitimat. Chief Priscilla Mueller of the Saikuz First Nation said Rio Tinto has lately shown some willingness to listen to the concerns of First Nations, which are focused mainly on the negative impact the dam and low river flows have had on salmon and sturgeon.

AB  - Trends in abundance of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, were analyzed to quantify the ecological effects of water abstraction for electricity generation. In years when the majority of returning chinook adults used the upper Nechako River for spawning, the survival of offspring for the entire river was poorer than in years when spawning was concentrated in the lower reaches. Relative to the historical discharge, the upper Nechako River has experienced the greatest degree of water abstraction, and the lower survival of chinook broods originating from the upper river may be due to early emergence of fry caused by elevated fall and winter water temperatures or to higher rates of predation on juveniles and loss of rearing habitat caused by the elimination of the spring freshet. Poor recruitment resulting from broods spawning predominately in the upper river has caused the trend in the abundance of Nechako River chinook to diverge from the trend of chinook populations of similar life history from unregulated tributaries of the Fraser River. Additional reductions in flow may further affect the capacity of the upper Nechako River to produce chinook salmon.

AB  - The flow-diverted Nechako River is the second largest tributary of the Fraser River which drains 25% of mainland British Columbia, Canada. The watershed provides critical reproductive habitats for anadromous chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and year-round habitat for the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) population. In this study, the chemical quality of sediment in the upper Nechako River and its major tributaries was examined for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), legacy organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and furans (PCDFs), labile (exchangeable) metals/metalloids, and major nutrients (N and P). ΣPCB and ΣPBDE were detected in channel bottom sediments at all Nechako River and tributary sites; hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 4,4′-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) were also detected at most sites. Organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides were not detected in any samples. While ΣPCB, ΣPBDE, HCB, and 4,4′-DDE concentrations in bottom sediments were always well below provincial and federal guidelines for the protection of aquatic life, concentrations of total labile As (AsT), CrT, CuT, FeT, MnT, NiT, and ZnT in suspended and/or bottom sediments often exceeded provincial threshold effect levels (℡) and, in some cases, approached or exceeded probable effect levels. Distinct CuT, NiT, PbT and ZnT concentration maxima in suspended sediments were linked to road and urban densities. Historical PCDD, PCDF and PAH data show that concentrations in bottom sediment samples were highest at a site in the lower Nechako River between Miworth and the City of Prince George where PCDD and PCDF concentrations exceeded the interim federal ℡. Nitrogen and P concentrations in bottom sediments were negatively correlated with water velocity and sediment texture; the evidence suggests that reductions in velocity resulting from the 1952 diversion of the Nechako River have increased the nutrient content of bottom substrates.

AB  - Temperature-dependent sex determination has been demonstrated in several animals, but in salmonids sex is generally believed to be under strict genetic control. We observed distorted sex ratios, attributable to a temperature manipulation during embryonic development, in experiments conducted during 1991 with the anadromous and nonanadromous (kokanee) forms of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Takla Lake, British Columbia. Sex ratios ranged from 62 to 84% female, and the biased ratio could not be accounted for by differential mortality by sex. The effect was observed independently in sockeye and kokanee crosses, as well as in the reciprocal hybrids. Similar crosses from Takla Lake in a previous year (1989) in which incubation temperature was not manipulated resulted in normal (1:1) sex ratios. Other populations of sockeye and kokanee from the same year (1991) but undergoing no temperature manipulation maintained normal sex ratios, as did populations from several disparate locations and years (1986-1994). The parsimonious conclusion is that the temperature manipulation during development was responsible for the biased sex ratio through a direct influence on sex differentiation. Hence, the possibility that temperature-dependent sex determination occurs in O. nerka, and perhaps other salmonids, deserves rigorous testing.

AB  - We evaluate the capacity of a regional climate model to simulate the statistics of extreme events, and also examine the effect of differing horizontal resolution, at the scale of individual hydrological basins in the topographically complex province of British Columbia, Canada. Two climate simulations of western Canada (WCan) were conducted with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (version 4) at 15 (CRCM15) and 45 km (CRCM45) horizontal resolution driven at the lateral boundaries by global reanalysis over the period 1973–1995. The simulations were evaluated with ANUSPLIN, a daily observational gridded surface temperature and precipitation product and with meteorological data recorded at 28 stations within the upper Peace, Nechako, and upper Columbia River basins. In this work, we focus largely on a comparison of the skill of each model configuration in simulating the 90th percentile of daily precipitation (PR90). The companion paper describes the results for a wider range of temperature and precipitation extremes over the entire WCan domain.Over all three watersheds, both simulations exhibit cold biases compared with observations, with the bias exacerbated at higher resolution. Although both simulations generally display wet biases in median precipitation, CRCM15 features a reduced bias in PR90 in all three basins in summer and throughout the year in the upper Columbia River basin. However, the higher resolution model is inferior to CRCM45 with respect to rarer heavy precipitation events and also displays high spatial variability and lower spatial correlations with ANUSPLIN compared with the coarser resolution model. A reduction in the range of PR90 biases over the upper Columbia basin is noted when the 15 km results are averaged to the 45 km grid. This improvement is partly attributable to the averaging of errors between different elevation data used in the gridded observations and CRCM, but the sensitivity of CRCM15 to resolved topography is also clear from spatial maps of seasonal extremes. At the station scale, modest but systematic reductions in the bias of PR90 relative to ANUSPLIN are again found when the CRCM15 results are averaged to the 45 km grid. Furthermore, the annual cycle of inter-station spatial variance in the upper Columbia River basin is well reproduced by CRCM15 but not by ANUSPLIN or CRCM45. The former result highlights the beneficial effect of spatial averaging of small-scale climate variability, whereas the latter is evidently a demonstration of the added value at high resolution vis-à-vis the improved simulation of precipitation at the resolution limit of the model.

AB  - The Wood Innovation Research Lab was designed as a low energy-use building to facilitate the construction and testing of engineered wood products by the faculty and staff of the Master of Engineering in Integrated Wood Design Program at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, BC, Canada. Constructed using a 533 mm thick-wall and 659 mm flat roof assembly, it received certification as Canada’s first industrial facility built to the International Passive House standard. Temperature and humidity sensors were installed in the north and south exterior wall assemblies to measure long-term hygrothermal performance. Data collected between 2018–2020 shows no record of long-term moisture accumulation within the exterior assemblies. Data collected during this time period was used to validate hygrothermal performance models for the building created using the WUFI® Plus software. Long-term performance models created using future climate data for five cities across Canada under two global warming scenarios shows favorable results, with an increase in average annual temperatures resulting in lower average relative humidity values at the interior face of the exterior sheathing board in the exterior wall assemblies.

AB  - BackgroundDespite successes in preventing and treating HIV, Indigenous people in Canada continue to face disproportionately high rates of HIV infection. Programs that support healing from lifetime trauma, support connection to culture, and reduce drug-related harms are critical to preventing HIV among young Indigenous people who use drugs. The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth intervention proposed here is a structured mobile-phone initiative to connect young Indigenous people who use drugs with Cedar Case Managers in a community-based setting. The intervention consists of a package of supports, including a mobile phone and cellular plan, weekly two-way text messaging, and support from Cedar Case Managers. MethodsThe Cedar Project WelTel mHealth study is a multi-site Zelen pre-randomized trial to measure the effect of a two-way supportive text-message intervention to reduce HIV vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in two Canadian cities. The trial is nested within the Cedar Project, an ongoing cohort study addressing HIV and hepatitis C vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. The Cedar Project Partnership, an independent body of Indigenous Elders, leaders, and health/social service experts, governs all aspects of the study. Two hundred participants will be followed over a 16-month period, with HIV propensity score at 6 months as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include HIV propensity at 1 year, HIV risk, resilience, psychological distress, access to drug-related services, and connection to culture measured at 6 months and 1 year. Primary analysis is by intention to treat. DiscussionCulturally safe interventions that address barriers to HIV prevention while supporting the strength of young Indigenous people who use drugs are urgently needed. Despite presenting a tremendous opportunity to connect young, highly transient Indigenous people who use drugs to prevention services, supportive two-way mHealth programs have yet to be tested for HIV prevention in a community-based setting with this population.

AB  - Background: Indigenous women involved in survival sex work face multiple layers of discrimination, criminalization and alarming levels of intergenerational and lifetime trauma. This longitudinal study examined historical, structural and interpersonal factors associated with survival sex work involvement among Indigenous women who have used drugs in British Columbia (BC), Canada.Methods: The Cedar Project is an ongoing cohort study involving young Indigenous people who have used illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Data was collected every 6 months from 2007 to 2016 . Generalized linear mixed-eﬀects modeling was used to model survival sex work involvement, deﬁned as exchanging sex for money, drugs, food or shelter in the previous six months.Results: Among 292 participants, 34% reported their family always/often lived by traditional culture and 37% reported their family always/often spoke their traditional language. In contrast, 48% had a parent in residential school and 72% were removed from their biological parents. In total, 55% of women were involved in survival sex work at baseline. In adjusted analyses, those who were single (ARR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.50–2.35), identiﬁed as two-spirit (ARR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.36–2.91), experienced sexual assault (ARR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.22–2.58), were denied access to shelter (ARR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.18–2.28), used crack daily (ARR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.36–3.31), used injection drugs (ARR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.98–3.07), and were unable to access substance use treatment (ARR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.15–2.05) were more likely to be involved in sex work.Conclusion: Indigenous-governed, wellness-based harm-reduction interventions, and structural reforms addressing housing insecurity and normalization of a culture of violence against Indigenous women, especially those involved in survival sex work, are urgently needed in Canada.

AB  - The Nechako Basin in British Columbia, Canada is suspected to have hydrocarbon potential. However, it has been a difficult basin to explore because of the presence of Tertiary volcanic outcrop. The volcanic outcrop makes the use of conventional seismic exploration methods difficult owing to a strong velocity inversion at its base. An alternative is the passive source method known as ambient noise surface wave tomography. The method, which examines the high-frequency surface wave field that is obtained from noise analysis, is sensitive to large-scale crustal structure and has been successfully applied to measuring the depths of sedimentary basins. Station-to-station Green's functions within the basin were estimated by cross-correlating the vertical components of the seismic noise data recorded by 12 POLARIS (Portable Observatories for Lithosphere Analysis and Research Investigating Seismicity) and CNSN (Canadian National Seismgraph Network) seismic stations between September 2006 and November 2007. The resulting Green's functions were dominated by Rayleigh waves. The dispersion characteristics of the Rayleigh waveforms were measured within the microseismic band. Inversion of the dispersion curves produced 1-D and 2-D thickness models and 2-D group velocity models for the Nechako Basin and its surrounding region. The velocity models indicate two low group velocity structures within the basin that might represent sedimentary packages, and some pockets of high-velocity zones that show the presence of volcanic rocks within and on the basin. The thickness models indicated the presence of about six different velocity layers, in which the average thickness of the basin and the crust are ~4.8 and 30-34 km, respectively.

AB  - The DNA sequences of four exons of the MHC (major histocompatibilty complex) were examined in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from an interior (Nechako River) and a coastal (Harrison River) population in the Fraser River drainage of British Columbia. Mhc class I A1, A2 and A3 sequences and a class II B1 sequence were obtained by PCR from each of 16–20 salmon from each population. The class I A1 and a pair of linked A2–A3 exons were derived from two different classical salmonid class I genes, Sasa-A and Onmy-UA, respectively. Allelic variation for B1, A1 and A2 was characterized by the high levels of nonsynonymous substitution indicative of the effects of natural selection on Mhc domains that contain peptide binding regions. The number of alleles detected at each of the four exons ranged from three (B1) to 22 (A1), but levels of nucleotide sequence divergence at all four exons were low relative to classical mammalian Mhc genes. The nucleotide similarity among alleles ranged between 89 and 99% over all exons, and all four domains possessed only two major sequence motifs. Allelic distributions at B1, A1 and A3 confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of the Harrison and Nechako chinook salmon populations revealed in previous studies. The two major allelic motifs of B1 and A1 segregated strongly between the populations. In spite of evidence that allelic diversity at these chinook salmon Mhc exons has been generated by selection, the level and distribution of diversity in the two salmon populations strongly reflected the demographic history of the species, which has been characterized by repeated bottlenecks and isolation-by-distance in glacial refugia.

We report learnings from an intergenerational digital storytelling workshop led by the Nak'azdli Health Centre in partnership with community organizations and academic partners. Framed by a participatory action design in accordance with the Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP(R)) principles, a 10 session workshop was created and piloted. WeVideo technology was used to facilitate knowledge sharing between elementary school students and Elders. Through storytelling, the Elders shared their wisdom and knowledge. The students recorded the stories and added imagery and sounds to capture their understandings in a digital format. Thus, Elders and students worked in partnership to co-create digital stories to create a cultural legacy for future generations. This workshop aligned with the British Columbia school curriculum, fostered intergenerational relationships between Elders and youth, helped preserve cultural identity, and facilitated opportunity for meaningful contribution for Elders and youth to their community.

AB  - The alkaline playas near Atlin, British Columbia, Canada are likely one of the few surface environments on Earth where contemporaneous formation of hydromagnesite and magnesite occurs at temperatures that do not exceed 15 degrees C. This environment offers a unique opportunity to examine the impact of different formation mechanisms on Mg isotope compositions of Mg-carbonate minerals at low temperature. In this study, we report the Mg isotope composition of ultramafic bedrock, Mg-carbonate sediments, and both surface and ground waters in this geological setting. The composition of hydromagnesite suggests a Rayleigh-type distillation effect on the fluid Mg isotope ratios in unsaturated sediment above the water table. Through this mechanism of formation, hydromagnesite is progressively depleted in Mg-24 obtaining delta Mg-26 values as high as +1.14 degrees% near the sediment surface. In contrast, magnesite formation is characterized by enrichment of the solid phase in Mg-24. The apparent Mg isotope fractionation factor during magnesite formation at similar to 10 degrees C ranges between -0.7 +/- 0.1%o and -1.8 +/- 0.1%o. The distinct Mg isotope composition of hydromagnesite in comparison to magnesite supports magnesite formation occurring by precipitation from the fluid, or dissolution-reprecipitation, rather than solid-phase transformation from a hydrous Mg-carbonate precursor. Overall, the results provide insights on low temperature Mg-carbonate mineral formation that has implications for long-term storage of CO2.

AB  - The Challis-Kamloops belt of south-central British Columbia is a regionally extensive (>65,000km(2)) magmatic province that erupted within the North American Cordillera during the Eocene (55-45 Ma). The inland volcanic belt runs parallel to the coast, and the rocks were emplaced mainly within extensional basins indicating volcanism was attributed to rift-related decompressional melting. The rocks include both talc-alkaline and tholeiitic mafic and intermediate types (i.e., low-Fe, medium-Fe, and high-Fe suites). Voluminous volcanic units (Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, Swans Lake) of the Buck Creek volcanic complex (similar to 3,000 km(2) in area) within the Nechako plateau erupted within 1-2 million years and show significant internal chemical variability. All rock types have similar Sr-Nd isotopic (Sr-87/Sr-86(i)= 0.70435-0.70487; epsilon(Nd)(t). +2.6-+-4.0) ratios indicating they originated from the same sub-Cordilleran mantle source. Petrological modeling using the most primitive rocks of the Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, and Swans Lake magmatic pulses demonstrates that the chemical variability observed in each system can be explained by hydrous fractional crystallization in the upper crust (<= 0.1 GPa) under moderately oxidizing to oxidizing conditions (Delta FMQ 0 to +0.7). The primary difference between the low-Fe to medium-Fe (talc-alkaline) Buck Creek suite model and the high-Fe to medium-Fe (tholeiitic) Swans Lake suite model is water content as the Swans Lake model has lower (H2O = 0.75 wt.%) starting water than the Buck Creek and also the Goosly Lake models (H2O =1.25-2.00 wt.%). Moreover, the intermediate to silicic rocks of the complexes are compositionally similar to rocks associated with "slab failure" suggesting that rifting and mantle melting were related to asthenospheric upwelling through a slab tear. The implications are that the chemical variability of the rock suites are primarily related to fractional crystallization and that the mantle source is heterogeneous with respect to water content which is likely due to heterogeneities in the processes related to pre-Eocene subduction.

AB  - Habitat in the low-water channel of the mainstem Fraser River and larger tributaries during winter may be an unappreciated factor influencing production of stream-type chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in this system. Data from electrofishing surveys showed that shorelines were used by juvenile chinook from river km 110 to km 770. Almost the entire mainstem was therefore probably winter habitat, and major tributaries such as the Thompson, Quesnel, and Nechako rivers were also used. Estimated chinook density on the mainstem Fraser increased with distance upstream (maximum 0.30 m-2 at km 750 (Prince George)), but the highest density (0.99 m-2) in the surveys was observed on the Thompson River at Spences Bridge. The mean size of juvenile chinook decreased with distance upstream on the Fraser, ranging from 97 mm at km 110 to 65 mm at km 770. Chinook juveniles were feeding on Diptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera in winter. Some apparent growth was observed in the lower Fraser in early winter.

AB  - Lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S. Watson) is an important lumber species in Canada, and seed orchards are expected to meet the increased demand for seed. However, seed production has been consistently low in the Okanagan region orchards of British Columbia, Canada. To determine whether the fungal microbiome contributes to seed loss, histological and molecular approaches were used. Seed production was studied at seven Okanagan orchards, all outside the natural range of lodgepole pine, and at one near Prince George, within its natural range. Seed losses were highest in the Okanagan, compared with Prince George. The role of fungal colonizers in consuming seed during the last stages of maturation is described. Fungal hyphae were frequently observed at all locations in developing seed, particularly once storage substances accumulated. Fungi identified from host tissues using molecular and morphological techniques included Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Sydowia. The opportunistic foliar pathogen Sydowia polyspora, which is known to have a variable biotrophic status, was detected at most orchards within different host tissues (seeds, needles, and conelets), in association with pollen, and in the air column. Reduced seed viability observed in Okanagan orchards is most likely due to a combination of factors, including composition of the fungal microbiome.

AB  - Aspects of the culture, resource exploitation and beliefs of the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en peoples of northwestern British Columbia are examined to explore the relationship of their cultural practices, land tenure, and beliefs to resource conservation. Traditional Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en practices and beliefs contain a number of elements which acted to promote conservation, including territoriality, prescribed burning, and proscription of waste, and other elements which are more difficult to reconcile with a biological model of conservation. The concept of humans as part of the natural world, and the requirement for respect for all natural entities are the fundamental to mediating human interactions with other species in the Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en cultures.

AB  - Infestations caused by the mountain pine beetle (MPB) can be seen as complex spatio-temporal process with severe ecological impacts on the forest environment. In order to manage and prevent the insect infestation and reduce significant forest loss it is necessary to improve knowledge about the infestation process. The main objective of this research study is to design and implement a model based on decision trees (DT) mashie learning (ML) technique to forecast the spatial propagation of MPB infestation. The study is implemented in the Bulkley-Nechako region of British Columbia, Canada using data sets for the three time points 2004, 2008 and 2012. The results indicate that the derived DT can accurately characterize the relationships between the considered factors and MPB propagation. The developed DT method can be used to estimate future spread patterns of MPB infestations.

AB  - On July 13, 2005 a complex 3 Mm(3) and 1.5 km long rock slide-debris avalanche occurred near Sutherland River, 40 km west of Fort St. James, British Columbia, Canada. The landslide was initiated in a succession of sub-horizontal competent mafic basalts (Endako Formation) capping weaker felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (Ootsa Lake Group) of Eocene age. Several landslides have been observed in similar volcanic successions worldwide including in southern British Columbia. Some common characteristics of these landslides are: structurally undisturbed; horizontal to sub-horizontal bedding; curved head scarp; steep joints; debris consists of intact blocks; volcaniclastics containing smectite (expandable clay mineral); fossils and lignite within the volcaniclastics. The Sutherland landslide is one of many large landslides that have occurred in recent years in northern British Columbia. At least eight other large landslides have been triggered in volcanic rocks within the Nechako plateau.

AB  - This study investigated the influence of the plant antifeedants, pinosylvin and pinosylvin methyl ether (PME), on suppression of feeding by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). Screening bioassays showed clearly that pinosylvin suppressed feeding by hares when sprayed directly on coniferous tree seedlings. Pinosylvin odor, when associated with food (but not mixed with it), also significantly reduced consumption of rabbit chow by hares. Large pen bioassays indicated that both pinosylvin and PME significantly reduced feeding on tree seedlings by hares when the antifeedants were sprayed directly on trees. In field bioassays near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, pinosylvin sprayed on trees and encapsulated in controlled-release devices of PVC plastic, with an internal wire as a twist-tie for attachment to tree, significantly reduced feeding by hares. Thus, pinosylvin will generate an "avoidance response" in terms of feeding by snowshoe hares. This response is likely triggered by an olfactory pathway based on positive results with controlled-release devices attached to seedlings. Our study reports the first practical utilization of plant antifeedants for forest crop protection and wildlife management.

AB  - Population structure of three ecotypes of Oncorhynchus nerka (sea-type Sockeye Salmon, lake-type Sockeye Salmon, and Kokanee) in the Fraser River and Columbia River drainages was examined with microsatellite variation, with the main focus as to whether Kokanee population structure within the Fraser River drainage suggested either a monophyletic or polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Variation at 14 microsatellite loci was surveyed for sea-type and lake-type Sockeye Salmon and Kokanee sampled from 121 populations in the two river drainages. An index of genetic differentiation, F-ST, over all populations and loci was 0.087, with individual locus values ranging from 0.031 to 0.172. Standardized to an ecotype sample size of 275 individuals, the least genetically diverse ecotype was sea-type Sockeye Salmon with 203 alleles, whereas Kokanee displayed the greatest number of alleles (260 alleles), with lake-type Sockeye Salmon intermediate (241 alleles). Kokanee populations from the Columbia River drainage (Okanagan Lake, Kootenay Lake), the South Thompson River (a major Fraser River tributary) drainage populations, and the mid-Fraser River populations all clustered together in a neighbor-joining analysis, indicative of a monophyletic origin of the Kokanee ecotype in these regions, likely reflecting the origin of salmon radiating from a refuge after the last glaciation period. However, upstream of the mid-Fraser River populations, there were closer relationships between the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype and the Kokanee ecotype, indicative of the Kokanee ecotype evolving independently from the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype in parallel radiation. Kokanee population structure within the entire Fraser River drainage suggested a polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Studies employing geographically restricted population sampling may not outline accurately the phylogenetic history of salmonid ecotypes.

AB  - AbstractWe explore the 1911–2010 variability in monthly runoff and the 1995–2005 summer water temperatures in a highly productive salmon system, the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, Canada. Hydrometric data from 141 FRB gauges provide variations in monthly runoff including their extremes and months of occurrences as well as trends in their variability. Stream temperatures and their relationships to runoff are also assessed. There is a gradual increase of monthly runoff ranges from the FRB’s central plateau toward higher altitudes with maxima in glacier-fed alpine streams. Maximum (minimum) monthly runoff across the FRB typically occurs during May-June (February). There is a tendency toward greater FRB variability in July runoff. Water temperatures show high variability in the unregulated North and South Thompson Rivers and low variability in the regulated Nechako River. FRB low (high) flows are associated to higher (cooler) water temperatures, both of which may negatively impact salmon.

AB  - While international instruments and a few state governments endorse the "free, prior and informed consent" of Indigenous peoples in decision-making about the water in their traditional territories, most state water governance regimes do not recognize Indigenous water rights and responsibilities. Applying a political ecology lens to the settler colonialism of water governance exposes the continued depoliticizing personality of natural resources decision-making and reveals water as an abstract, static resource in law and governance processes. Most plainly, these decision-making processes inadequately consider environmental flows or cumulative effects and are at odds with both Indigenous governance and social-ecological approaches to watershed management. Using the example of groundwater licensing in British Columbia, Canada as reinforcing colonialism in water governance, this article examines how First Nations are asserting Indigenous rights in response to natural resource decision-making. Both within and outside of colonial governance processes they are establishing administrative and governance structures that express their water laws and jurisdiction. These structures include the Syilx, Nadleh Wut'en and Stellat'en creating standards for water, the Tsleil-Waututh and Stk'emlupsemc te Secwepemc community assessments of proposed pipeline and mining facilities, and the First Nations of the Nicola Valley planning process based on their own legal traditions. Where provincial and federal environmental governance has failed, Indigenous communities are repoliticizing colonial decision-making processes to shift jurisdiction towards Indigenous processes that institutionalize responsibilities for and relationships with water.

AB  - Conflict characterizes energy projects across Canada and around the world. While claims about economics, the environment and Indigenous rights dominate headlines, energy conflicts also feature struggles over the construction of space and scale. Building on work in energy geographies, this paper compares the spatial politics of three contested fossil fuel projects, focusing on how antagonistic parties frame issues to advance their positions, in turn shaping perceptions of scale. Drawing on reports, media coverage, and other secondary sources, we examine: the Trans Mountain pipeline in Western Canada; the Coastal GasLink pipeline in Wet'suwet'en territory, British Columbia; and shale gas drilling in New Brunswick. The analysis reveals how actors construct space and scale to persuade, build alliances, and exclude people or issues from consideration. Project proponents generally 'scale up' claims about benefits and 'scale down' impacts, while opponents do the opposite - even as both strategically engage with governance at multiple scales. We argue that taking spatial politics seriously can reveal power dynamics in competing representations of space, improve transparency in energy project evaluations by unveiling tacit proponent strategies, and reveal biases in impact assessment and legal processes when their mandates favour the spatial strategies of project proponents.

AB  - ObjectivesThis study examined associations between childhood maltreatment, colonial harms and sex/drug-related risks for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young Indigenous people who use drugs. DesignThe Cedar Project is a cohort involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Indigenous collaborators, collectively known as the Cedar Project Partnership, govern the entire research process. SettingVancouver is a large city on the traditional territory of the Coast Salish peoples. Prince George is a mid-sized city, on the traditional territory of Lheidli T’enneh First Nation. Participants420 participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and returned for follow-up from 2003 to 2016. Primary/secondary outcome measuresPrimary outcomes were HIV and HCV infection over the study period. Secondary outcomes included sex and substance use-related risks. ResultsPrevalence of childhood maltreatment was 92.6% experienced any maltreatment; 73.4% experienced emotional abuse; 62.6% experienced physical abuse; 60.3% experienced sexual abuse; 69.5% experienced emotional neglect and 79.1% experienced physical neglect. We observed significant associations between childhood maltreatment and apprehensions into residential schools and foster care. All maltreatment types were associated with higher odds of sex/substance use-related risks; sexual abuse was associated with higher odds of HCV infection (adjusted OR: 1.67; 95% CI 1.05 to 2.66; p=0.031). ConclusionsFindings reflect high prevalence of childhood maltreatment and their associations with HIV/HCV risk and HCV infection. Public health prevention and treatment initiatives must be trauma informed and culturally safe to support healing, health, and well-being.

AB  - In 2008, a Vibroseis seismic reflection survey was acquired by Geoscience BC across the eastern part of the volcanic-covered Nechako basin in central British Columbia, where Cretaceous sedimentary rocks have been exhumed along a NNW trend. Good signal penetration through the volcanic cover is indicated by lower crustal reflections at 8-12 s, which were recorded by the entire seismic survey. Comparison of the 2008 seismic survey with data from a previous survey indicates that the lack of reflectivity in the earlier surveys is generally representative of the subsurface geology. The seismic data show that ∼1700 and ∼2900 m thick sub-basins are present at the northern and southern ends of this trend, but the intervening Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous and relatively thin. The creation of a passive-roof duplex by Campanian or later low-angle thrusting is inferred within the thickest Cretaceous strata, but elsewhere faulting is likely related to Eocene extension or transtension. Seismic reflections are also recorded from folded volcanic stratigraphy, the base of the surface volcanic rocks, an underlying volcaniclastic stratigraphy, and intrusions projecting into a Quaternary volcanic cone. Seismic interpretation is complemented by coincident audiofrequency magnetotelluric surveys, from which faulting is inferred at offsets in a regional conductor. No regionally extensive stratigraphy can be identified within the seismic data, and the central Nechako basin appears to be a complex network of small, deformed sub-basins, rather than a single large basin.

AB  - Health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples persist globally. Northern interior British Columbia, where many Indigenous people live on Indian reserves allocated in the late nineteenth century, is no exception. This article reviews findings from fifty-eight interviews with members of thirteen First Nations communities in Carrier, Sekani, Wet'suwet’en, and Babine territories. The results suggest that colonial geographies, both physical and social, along with extant anti-Indigenous racism, are significant determinants of the health and well-being (or lack thereof) of many First Nations in the region.

AB  - Health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples persist globally. Northern interior British Columbia, where many Indigenous people live on Indian1 reserves allocated in the late nineteenth century, is no exception. This article reviews findings from fifty-eight interviews with members of thirteen First Nations communities in Carrier, Sekani, Wet'suwet’en, and Babine territories. The results suggest that colonial geographies, both physical and social, along with extant anti-Indigenous racism, are significant determinants of the health and well-being (or lack thereof) of many First Nations in the region.

AB  - With its headwaters in the water towers of the western Cordillera of North America, the Fraser River is one of the continent’s mightiest rivers by annual flows, supplies vital freshwater resources to populous downstream locations, and sustains the world’s largest stocks of sockeye salmon along with four other salmon species. Here we show the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model’s ability to reproduce accurately observed trends in daily streamflow for the Fraser River’s main stem and six of its major tributaries over 1949-2006 when air temperatures rose by 1.4 °C while annual precipitation amounts remained stable. Rapidly declining mountain snowpacks and earlier melt onsets result in a 10-day advance of the Fraser River’s spring freshet with subsequent reductions in summer flows when up-river salmon migrations occur. Identification of the sub-basins driving the Fraser River’s most significant changes provides a measure of seasonal predictability of future floods or droughts in a changing climate.

AB  - Climate change and resource development interact to have significant impacts on both natural and human systems within watersheds. It is, however, difficult to conceptualize and communicate these intersections, as climate change and resource development are each independently uncertain and complex. We facilitated a process whereby stakeholders created plausible future scenarios for the Nechako Watershed in British Columbia, Canada. This region is reliant upon, and has been significantly affected by, many types of resource exploitation. During a full-day workshop, 32 stakeholders created scenarios for 2050 envisioning high and low levels of both resource development and climate change. The high and low levels of climate change were based on downscaled projections from global emissions scenarios, and the resource development levels were determined at the beginning of the workshop by the participants. The exercise was educational, and motivated stakeholders to conceptualize plausible future changes and their impacts, and the outcomes should motivate stakeholders to work towards realizing a more desired future. All scenarios (even low-low) were deemed to have significant negative impacts, suggesting that the Nechako Watershed is in a vulnerable state. The complexity of the exercise suggests that more capacity building may be necessary.

AB  - Near the Pleistocene Termination, a glacier-dammed lake in central British Columbia suddenly drained to the south along the Fraser River valley. Floodwater travelled 330 km down the valley to Hope, British Columbia, and from there to the west into the Salish Sea near Vancouver. The flood was caused by the failure of an ice dam formed by the terminus of glaciers flowing from the central Coast Mountains across the British Columbia Interior Plateau. The ice dam impounded several hundred cubic kilometres of water to a maximum elevation of about 810 m asl (above sea level); at its maximum, the lake at the ice dam was over 250 m deep. Geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for the flood includes streamlined boulder-strewn bars, gravel dune fields, and terraces sloping up Fraser and lowermost Thompson valleys, opposite the present direction of river flow. The gravel bars and flood terraces are underlain by sheets of massive to poorly sorted gravel containing large boulders and rip-up clasts of silt and till. Shortly after the flood, a landslide near the northern margin of the former glacier dam impounded water to an elevation of about 550 m asl. This lake emptied due to overflow and incision of the landslide dam. The outburst flood from glacial Lake Fraser and the subsequent draining of the landslide-dammed lake deeply incised the older sediment fill in Fraser Valley and transported much of this sediment into the protoSalish Sea west of Vancouver, British Columbia and Bellingham, Washington. TCN ages on flood-transported boulders at three localities along the flood path agree with radiocarbon ages on inferred flood layers in ODP cores collected from Saanich Inlet, a fiord on southern Vancouver Island, 80 km south-southwest of Vancouver.

AB  - Quantification of climate change impacts on the thermal regimes of rivers in British Columbia (BC) is crucial given their importance to aquatic ecosystems. Using the Air2Stream model, we investigate the impact of both air temperature and streamflow changes on river water temperatures from 1950 to 2015 across BC's 234,000 km2 Fraser River Basin (FRB). Model results show the FRB's summer water temperatures rose by nearly 1.0 °C during 1950-2015 with 0.47 °C spread across 17 river sites. For most of these sites, such increases in average summer water temperature have doubled the number of days exceeding 20 °C, the water temperature that, if exceeded, potentially increases the physiological stress of salmon during migration. Furthermore, river sites, especially those in the upper and middle FRB, show significant associations between Pacific Ocean teleconnections and regional water temperatures. A multivariate linear regression analysis reveals that air temperature primarily controls simulated water temperatures in the FRB by capturing ~80% of its explained variance with secondary impacts through river discharge. Given such increases in river water temperature, salmon returning to spawn in the Fraser River and its tributaries are facing continued and increasing physical challenges now and potentially into the future.

AB  - The global population is growing at an incomprehensible rate and with it come complex environmental consequences that often result in social injustices. The United Nations has established a set of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in an attempt to ameliorate inequality and promise safety for the masses. To reach these goals, a set of indicators have been identified and their associated data for each country are publicly available to measure how close each country is to each goal. Multifaceted social and environmental processes that are difficult to understand are causing threats to these goals. Maps help reduce complexity. Now, arguably anyone with access to the Internet and time can make a map. However, not all maps are effective accurate communication vessels. Well-designed maps tell a story that truthfully represents the data available. Here we present a synthesis of the cartographic workflow pointing out specific considerations necessary when mapping SDG indicators. Along the way we illustrate the cartographic workflow as it relates to visualizing SDG indicators. Common mapping pitfalls are described and a range of suggestions to avoid them are also offered. Map makers have a unique opportunity to use these data to illuminate and communicate injustices that are documented therein to inspire creative localized solutions to eradicate inequality.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the challenges and successes experienced by parents in providing children with opportunities for healthy living. Focus group interviews were conducted with parents of children 0-6 years to discuss challenges and successes in healthy eating, active living and being screen smart. The focus group interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed. Three main themes emerged from transcripts which include: Barriers to Healthy Living; Parent Involvement; and Child Involvement. It is recommended that the Healthy Families Prince George committee design community initiatives to support families in the Prince George area to achieve optimal healthy living, based on the study results. Upstream social policies are warranted in order to support low socio-economic status (SES) male parents and their families to achieve healthy lifestyle including healthy eating and active living.

AB  - Electric vehicles (EVs) may add new challenges during mass evacuations. Understanding the magnitude of the impacts EVs may have during the pre-departure stage of mass evacuations is an essential first step when planning for mass evacuations in a future where EVs are more common. In this paper, a generalized framework based on a G/G/c/N queueing model (general arrival process, general service process, c charging stations, and N EVs) was developed to estimate the number of vehicles that can be charged in the pre-departure evacuation stage and thus assess the pre-departure impacts. The model outputs are the number of vehicles that have or have not been served during the evacuation period, as well as average queue times and maximum queue lengths. This model is tested using the current electric vehicle fleet and charging infrastructure of Prince George, British Columbia, as a case study with a hypothetical short notice forest fire scenario. It was found that for the present-day case of Prince George, there is not enough charging network capacity to service all vehicles before departure. Increasing the number of charging stations, providing earlier evacuation notices, and ensuring a balanced makeup of level 3 fast-charging of different types were all found to be effective in increasing the number of EVs that received adequate charging before departure.

AB  - Respectful and reciprocal relationships with land are at the heart of many Indigenous cultures and societies. Land is also at the core of settler colonialism. Indigenous peoples have not only been dispossessed of land for settler occupation and resource extraction, but the transformation of land into property has created myriad challenges to ongoing struggles of land repatriation and renewal. We introduce several perspectives on land rooted in diverse Indigenous worldviews and contrast them with settler colonial perspectives rooted in Eurocentric worldviews. We then examine several examples in Canada where Indigenous nations attempt to reconnect with their homelands, protect them, and/or engage with them for economic development. We look at land relationships rooted in historical treaties, contemporary comprehensive claims/self-government agreements, the Indian Act, and the defence of unceded territories. The Indigenous communities we look at include the Six Nations of the Grand River, the Nisga'a Lisims Government, the Westbank First Nation, and the Wet'suwet'en. We contend that a complex configuration of settler colonial institutions challenges long-term efforts for Indigenous land reclamation, protection, and sustainable development, however, Indigenous nations remain steadfast in asserting their self-determination in diverse relational ways inside and outside of settler state systems.
