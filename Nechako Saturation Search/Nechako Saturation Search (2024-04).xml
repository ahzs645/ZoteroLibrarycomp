First Nations Elders are a unique group and little knowledge currently exists of their preferred forms of social interaction. The objective of this study was to describe the types of programs Nak'azdli Elders desire, identify barriers to participation, and improve creation of programs that address Elders' needs and interests. Methods This project was co-created by the Nak'azdli Health Centre and Elders, located in Northern British Columbia, with support from academic partners when and where asked. An advisory committee selected participants perceived as able to complete the survey and available for interviewing. Participants were interviewed orally in English or Carrier in their homes or at a drop-in centre, by a well-respected Nak'azdli Elder. The Elder entered participant responses (including self-reported health, awareness and utilization for existing programs, and preferences for new programs) into a paper-based survey. Descriptive and content analysis were conducted. Results Nak'azdli Elders (N = 38) were interested in wisdom sharing, social programs, and health-related activities. Elders wanted to be actively engaged in programs/activity selection, helping organize programs, knowledge sharing, skills, and stories. Barriers to participation included lack of transportation, personal health concerns, scheduling conflicts, and lack of knowledge about programs/activities. Conclusion Nak'azdli Elders were interested in culturally relevant programs involving sharing cultural knowledge, teachings, and/or language with younger generations. Elders wanted to be engaged in all stages of activities, including planning, participation, and evaluation. Future programs should prioritize community collaboration and co-creation with Elders.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Thomson, AJ</author><author>Muir, A</author><author>Lewis, KJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability in sub-regional impacts of dwarf mistletoe on mature lodgepole pine</title><secondary-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</full-title></periodical><pages>371-375</pages><volume>73</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>dwarf mistletoe rating (DMR)</keyword><keyword>Forest Practices Code</keyword><keyword>GROWTH-PATTERNS</keyword><keyword>roadside survey</keyword><keyword>WESTERN HEMLOCK STANDS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-7546</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5558/tfc73371-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Impact of lodgepole pine dwarf mistletoe was determined in six sub-areas of Forest Inventory Zone H, near Prince George, British Columbia, using a roadside survey and measurements of mature infected trees. Mistletoe effects on DBH were evident only in two of the sub-areas surveyed (Westlake and Nechako). After correcting DBH measurements for competition (stand density), dbh of 100-120 year old and 121-150 year old trees was reduced 10% and 17% respectively, in the highest mistletoe rating (DMR) category (4.5-6.0). Height/DBH relationships were affected by dwarf mistletoe only in the Nechako area. Mistletoe effects in the Nechako and Westlake areas, in stands older than 120 years with mistletoe ratings of 4.5-6.0, resulted in volume reductions of 28-42%, depending on the effects of mistletoe on height. Further losses might accrue in lodgepole pine stands if clear-cut harvesting were restricted by the BC Forest Practices Code, unless infected stems are selectively removed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taylor, EB</author><author>Chudnow, R</author><author>Pillipow, R</author><author>Spendlow, I</author><author>van Poorten, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Microsatellite DNA analysis of overwintering bull trout (Salvelinus confluentus) and its implications for harvest regulation and habitat management</title><secondary-title>FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FISHERIES MANAGEMENT AND ECOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>219-229</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Fraser River</keyword><keyword>char</keyword><keyword>habitat use</keyword><keyword>mixture analysis</keyword><keyword>recreational fishing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0969-997X,1365-2400</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/fme.12473</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A mixed-stock fishery occurs when multiple populations of a fish species are exploited together in a common area where they aggregate outside the breeding season (e.g. for feeding or overwintering), and the aggregation is known as a mixture. Recreational fishing often exploits such mixtures, and estimating the proportional contributions of populations to fisheries promotes more sustainable resource use. Ten DNA microsatellites were assayed in a mixture of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus Suckley overwintering in the Nechako River, upper Fraser River, British Columbia, and in baseline population samples from 14 tributaries putatively contributing to the overwintering mixture. A DNA microsatellite-based mixed-stock fishery analysis suggested that five populations together contributed 0.80 to the mixture. Most of the errors associated with the mixture estimates were attributable to uncertainty in baseline allele frequencies. Radiotracking data confirmed that tributary populations contributing to the mixture estimated by genetic analysis also contained individuals that moved between spawning tributaries and overwintering sites. The results better resolve habitat use by potadromous bull trout in the upper Fraser River and, in combination with assessments of baseline population-specific spawning abundances and productivity, will better inform a decision of whether or not allowing some harvest within the current catch-and-release fishery is biologically sustainable.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tardy, M</author><author>Lapierre, H</author><author>Struik, LC</author><author>Bosch, D</author><author>Brunet, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of mantle plume in the genesis of the Cache Creek oceanic igneous rocks: implications for the geodynamic evolution of the inner accreted terranes of the Canadian Cordillera</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>515-534</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>PERIDOTITES</keyword><keyword>SPINEL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-104</electronic-resource-num><abstract>West of Prince George, British Columbia, the Cache Creek Terrane is composed of mafic lavas interlayered with both mid-Permian pelagic limestones and Upper Triassic siliceous shales and greywackes. Gabbro, basalt, dolerites, and foliated clinopyroxene-rich ultramafic rocks are exposed within the Pinchi Fault system. The mid-Permian lavas show affinities of oceanic island tholeiites. Among the Triassic lavas, three types of rocks have been distinguished. Type 1 is geochemically similar to the mid-Permian volcanic rocks. Type 2 differs from type 1 by higher TiO2 abundances and convex rare earth element patterns. Type 3 has the highest Zr, Nb, and Ta abundances and the greatest light rare earth element enrichment. The mafic rocks within the Pinchi Fault system are similar to N-type mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB), and the foliated ultramafic rocks are characterized by very low trace element contents, similar to extremely depleted harzburgites. Permian lavas and Triassic type 1 and igneous rocks from the Pinchi Fault system have the highest epsilon(Nd(i)) ratios (+7.4 to +9.6) and those of type 3 alkali have the lowest ratios (+2.0 to +5.3). The epsilon(Nd(i)) values of type 2 are intermediate between those of type 1 (similar to +7) and type 3 (similar to +4.9). This suggests that the Triassic rocks generated from a heterogeneous plume source or the mixing between depleted N-MORB and enriched oceanic island basalt sources. If the mafic igneous rocks sampled in central British Columbia are representative of the preserved parts of an oceanic crust, within the Cache Creek Terrane, then that crust was dominated by oceanic plateau components, perhaps due to the difficulty of subducting thick crust.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Talucci, AC</author><author>Krawchuk, MA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dead forests burning: the influence of beetle outbreaks on fire severity and legacy structure in sub-boreal forests</title><secondary-title>ECOSPHERE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECOSPHERE</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>sub-boreal</keyword><keyword>mountain pine beetle</keyword><keyword>WESTERN UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE</keyword><keyword>WILDFIRE</keyword><keyword>ALPINE</keyword><keyword>CROWN FIRE</keyword><keyword>deep char</keyword><keyword>Dendroctonous ponderosae</keyword><keyword>DISTURBANCES</keyword><keyword>latifolia</keyword><keyword>legacy structure</keyword><keyword>Pinus contorta var</keyword><keyword>POSTFIRE TREE REGENERATION</keyword><keyword>short-interval disturbances</keyword><keyword>snags</keyword><keyword>wildfire</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ecs2.2744</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent regional mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks have generated unprecedented tree mortality across the fire-prone landscapes of western North American forests and could potentially modify fire severity and postfire ecological effects. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, three fires burned through high mortality, gray-phase lodgepole pine-dominated forests in the plateau regions of central interior British Columbia, Canada, providing an opportunity to test for interactions between MPB outbreaks and wildfires. We inventoried 63 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, fire severity, and burning conditions in a wilderness setting. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of outbreak severity on fire severity by assessing typical first-order fire effects as well as legacy structure related to the consumption of woody biomass on snags/trees. We found no evidence of a relationship between outbreak severity and fire severity for six of seven first-order fire effects, with the exception of deep charring. We found evidence that legacy structure in the form of consumed branch structure and deep char development had greater odds of occurrence on MPB-killed snags compared to trees killed during wildfire. Our results indicate two key findings. First, fire severity as it relates to most first-order fire effects measures is not influenced by outbreak severity, instead it is more strongly influenced by the interaction of fuels, weather, and topography during fire events. Second, our results highlight how the interaction between outbreak severity and fire severity alters postfire structural legacies and their functional attributes, which could have important ecosystem implications.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Talinga, D</author><author>Calvert, AJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution of Paleogene and Cretaceous rocks around the Nazko River belt of central British Columbia from 3-D long-offset first-arrival seismic tomography</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>358-372</pages><volume>51</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>VOLCANIC-ROCKS</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>DEXTRAL STRIKE-SLIP</keyword><keyword>EOCENE</keyword><keyword>REFLECTION</keyword><keyword>U-PB</keyword><keyword>AGE CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>MOUNTAIN-GROUP</keyword><keyword>SOUTHEASTERN NECHAKO BASIN</keyword><keyword>TYAUGHTON-METHOW BASIN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2013-0143</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Across the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of British Columbia, the distribution of Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, which are considered prospective for hydrocarbon exploration, is poorly known due to the surface cover of glacial deposits and Tertiary volcanic rocks. To constrain the subsurface distribution of these Cretaceous rocks, in 2008 Geoscience BC acquired seven long, up to 14.4 km, offset vibroseis seismic reflection lines across a north-northwest-trending belt of exhumed sedimentary rocks inferred to be part of the Taylor Creek Group. P-wave velocity models, which are consistent with sonic logs from nearby wells, have been estimated using three-dimensional first-arrival tomography to depths ranging from 1 to 4 km. Igneous basement can be identified on most lines using the 5.5 km/s isovelocity contour, which locates the top of the basement to an accuracy of similar to 400 m where its depth is known in exploration wells. There is no general distinction on the basis of seismic velocity between Cretaceous sedimentary and Paleocene-Eocene volcanic-volcaniclastic rocks, both of which appear to be characterized in the tomographic models by velocities of 3.0-5.0 km/s. The geometry of the igneous basement inferred from the velocity models identifies north-trending basins and ridges, which correlate with exposed rocks of the Jurassic Hazelton Group. Identified Cretaceous sedimentary rocks occur beneath less negative Bouguer gravity anomalies, but the original distribution of these rocks has been disrupted by later Tertiary extension that created north-trending basins associated with the most negative gravity anomalies. We suggest that Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, if deposited, could be preserved within these basins if the rocks had not been eroded prior to Tertiary extension.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Taguchi, S</author><author>Hosokawa, K</author><author>Suzuki, S</author><author>Yukimatu, AS</author><author>Sato, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Initial development of HF radar polar patch caused by azimuthal flow burst in the cusp</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS</full-title></periodical><volume>115</volume><keywords><keyword>FIELD</keyword><keyword>CONVECTION</keyword><keyword>IONOSPHERE</keyword><keyword>CAP</keyword><keyword>DENSITY STRUCTURES</keyword><keyword>F-REGION</keyword><keyword>IONIZATION PATCHES</keyword><keyword>IRREGULARITIES</keyword><keyword>SPECTRAL WIDTH</keyword><keyword>SUPERDARN RADARS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-9380,2169-9402</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2009JA014631</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this study, we report evidence proving the existence of a close relationship between the initial development of a poleward propagating feature of the HF radar backscatter, that is, HF radar polar patch, and a fast azimuthal flow in the cusp. We focus on two events in which the HF radar polar patch was formed and was identified by the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network radars at Saskatoon, Canada, and Prince George, Canada, on 27 March 2001. We examine their spatial and temporal development. The two events occurred at the interface between the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) B-Y-controlled azimuthal flow and the antisunward flow typical of a negative IMF B-Z; they developed in a longitudinally asymmetric manner. The increase in vertical bar BY/BZ vertical bar when B-Z was negative triggered the fast azimuthal flow. We interpret the temporal and spatial development of the HF radar polar patch in terms of the plasma density gradient created by the azimuthal flow and in terms of the subsequent development of the gradient in the direction of both the azimuthal flow and the antisunward flow.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;49</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Symons, DTA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paleomagnetic results from Jurassic Topley Intrusions near Endako, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>350-352</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1974</year><pub-dates><date>1974</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e74-032</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sykes, GE</author><author>Johnson, CJ</author><author>Shrimpton, JM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperature and Flow Effects on Migration Timing of Chinook Salmon Smolts</title><secondary-title>TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY</full-title></periodical><pages>1252-1265</pages><volume>138</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>WILD</keyword><keyword>ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA</keyword><keyword>SURVIVAL</keyword><keyword>PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>MODEL SELECTION</keyword><keyword>PHOTOPERIOD</keyword><keyword>SALAR</keyword><keyword>SEAWATER TOLERANCE</keyword><keyword>SNAKE RIVER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-8487,1548-8659</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1577/T08-180.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Physiological and behavioral changes occur in the spring when juvenile Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. undergo smolting. Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93% and 99%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;64 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Swainger, JONATHAN</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Axiety at the gates of Hell: Community Reputation in the Georges, 1908-15.</title><secondary-title>BC Studies</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BC Studies</full-title><abbr-1>BC Studies</abbr-1></periodical><pages>57-78</pages><number>205</number><issue>205</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>HISTORY of British Columbia</keyword><keyword>PRINCE George (B.C.)</keyword><keyword>PROVINCIAL governments</keyword><keyword>REPUTATION</keyword><keyword>SUBURBS</keyword><keyword>WORLD War I</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00052949</isbn><abstract>The article talks about the community reputation of South Fort George, Fort George and Prince George in British Columbia (BC).

Framed in part by language centred on the nefarious influences of American crime comics, rock and roll music, ducktail haircuts, and zoot suits, the crisis can be explained by emerging generational identities, Cold War angst, and media portrayals of a society allegedly on the verge of collapse. For parents and community leaders in Prince George, British Columbia, however, the long-standing unease over the community's reputation as a disorderly lumber town provided a crucial backdrop for these broader factors. As the community increasingly aspired to the trappings of postwar, middle-class respectability, the concern over teen trouble provided an arena to wrestle over community identity and the ways local residents wished to be seen by the outside world.

Radiation is usually recommended for patients with invasive breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. Internationally, there is general agreement that regional nodal radiation is beneficial when four or more nodes are positive, and in BC adjuvant regional nodal radiation also tends to be offered to all patients with any number of positive nodes after both breast conserving surgery and mastectomy. Most patients who are found to be node-negative after mastectomy do not require adjuvant radiation therapy. However, patients at risk because of their young age or the size and biology of their tumors may be candidates for radiation therapy. Because adjuvant radiation therapy is based on pretreatment staging, it is important to accurately determine both the primary and nodal stage, especially in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Typically, radiation therapy sessions last 15 to 20 minutes and can be given over 16 to 20 sessions. Patients are monitored regularly during treatment for management of side effects, which can include fatigue, dermatitis, and breast/chest wall tenderness. In the long term there can be permanent cosmetic changes, and rare risks of lung, rib, and heart damage, as well as second malignancies. Before 2012 any patient choosing breast conserving surgery in Northern BC needed to travel to a regional cancer centre in Southern BC for adjuvant radiation therapy. Since the opening of BC Cancer Centre for the North in Prince George on 1 November 2012, patients undergoing breast conserving surgery in Northern BC have been able to receive radiation therapy closer to home, and this appears to be why an increasing number of patients in one surgeon's practice have opted for partial mastectomy and adjuvant radiation rather than mastectomy.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Wagner, RG</author><author>Pitt, DG</author><author>Lautenschlager, RA</author><author>Chen, DG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changes in diversity of plant and small mammal communities after herbicide application in sub-boreal spruce forest</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>168-177</pages><volume>28</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>CLEARCUTS</keyword><keyword>ECOSYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>GLYPHOSATE</keyword><keyword>HABITAT</keyword><keyword>RESPONSES</keyword><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067,1208-6037</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfr-28-2-168</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide (glyphosate, active ingredient) application for conifer release would reduce species diversity (measured as richness, Simpson's index, and Shannon-Wiener index) of both plant and small mammal communities over a 5-year period in young sub-boreal spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm, x Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) forest. Four treated and four untreated (control) sites were studied near Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada. Crown volume index of shrub vegetation was reduced by herbicide application. Species richness of shrubs was reduced in the first year after treatment and remained lower on treated sites throughout the 5-year period. Both indices of shrub diversity, however, were not different over the 5 years. Herbicide treatment initially reduced crown volume index of herbaceous vegetation, but values quickly recovered to untreated levels by the second year after treatment. Herbaceous species diversity was not affected by herbicide treatment. Diversity of small mammal communities apparently was not affected by herbicide application. In general, diversity of plant and small mammal communities seemed to be maintained, and hence, these treatment sites may not lower overall diversity of a forested landscape. Silvicultural practices, such as conifer release with herbicides or alternative methods, may contribute to a diversity of stand structures and wildlife habitats if appropriately designed and implemented.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Sullivan, DS</author><author>Lindgren, PMF</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stand structure and small mammals in young lodgepole pine forest: 10-year results after thinning</title><secondary-title>ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>1151-1173</pages><volume>11</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>crop trees</keyword><keyword>Pinus contorta</keyword><keyword>silviculture</keyword><keyword>SNOWSHOE HARES</keyword><keyword>stand density</keyword><keyword>RED SQUIRRELS</keyword><keyword>OLD-GROWTH</keyword><keyword>DIVERSITY</keyword><keyword>biodiversity</keyword><keyword>DEMOGRAPHIC-CHANGES</keyword><keyword>DOUGLAS-FIR PLANTATIONS</keyword><keyword>FEEDING DAMAGE</keyword><keyword>FLUCTUATING POPULATIONS</keyword><keyword>MANAGED FORESTS</keyword><keyword>old-growth forest</keyword><keyword>precommercial thinning</keyword><keyword>small mammals</keyword><keyword>species richness and diversity</keyword><keyword>stand structure</keyword><keyword>tree growth</keyword><keyword>UNDERSTORY VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>wildlife habitat</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1051-0761,1939-5582</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/1051-0761(2001)011[1151:SSASMI]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Management of forested landscapes for biological diversity is a major objective across North America. Perhaps the greatest potential to diversify future forests lies in the vast areas of young second-growth stands which may be managed silviculturally to accelerate ecosystem development. This study was designed to test the hypotheses that large-scale precommercial thinning, at ages 17-27 yr, to various stand densities would, over the 10-yr period since treatment, enhance: (1) productivity of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) crop trees, (2) stand structure attributes, and (3) species richness and diversity of forest floor small-mammal communities. Study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada, in three forest ecological zones. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 (low), similar to 1000 (medium), and similar to 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned juvenile pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Understory vegetation was measured in all stands in 1990, 1993, and 1998, and coniferous tree layers were measured in 1998. Small-mammal populations were sampled intensively in 1990, 1991, and 1998. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than those in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Mean height increments of trees were similar in the medium- and high-density stands and significantly higher than that in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George. Crown volume index (biomass) of herbs was highest in the thinned stands by 1998, but there was no difference among stands for shrubs and trees; volume of mosses was highest in the old-growth stands. Mean species richness and diversity of herbs, shrubs, and trees were similar among stands at 2, 5, and 10 yr after thinning. However, mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous trees were significantly higher in the low- and medium-density stands than in the high-density and unthinned stands 10 yr after thinning. Total structural diversity of all vegetation in the low-density stands was significantly greater than that of the medium-density, unthinned, and old-growth stands in 1998. Mean total abundance of all small mammals was similar among stands in 1990-1991, but the low-density and old-growth stands had the most mammals in 1998. Mean abundance of southern red-backed voles (Clethrionomys gapperi) was consistently higher (2.1-3.3 times) in the old-growth stands than in unthinned stands. In seven of nine cases, mean abundance of red-backed voles was similar among old-growth and thinned stands. Mean species richness and species diversity of small mammals were highest in the low-density and medium-density stands. Heavily thinned lodgepole pine stands developed structural attributes such as large diameter trees, large crowns, and structurally diverse vegetative understories. Forest floor small-mammal communities reflected the compositional and structural diversity of these managed stands.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;95 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;103 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;88</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Sullivan, DS</author><author>Lindgren, PMF</author><author>Ransome, DB</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term responses of ecosystem components to stand thinning in young lodgepole pine forest IV.

We tested the hypothesis that relative habitat use by snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), and moose (Alces alces) would increase in response to enhanced abundance of herbs and shrubs, and species diversity and structural diversity of conifers, in heavily thinned (&lt;= 1000 stems/ha) stands, at 12-15 years post-thinning. Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three young pine stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 stems/ha (low), similar to 1000 stems/ha (medium), and similar to 2000 stems/ha (high), with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Relative habitat use, based on counts of fecal pellets and pellet-groups, was similar among the five treatment stands for hares (P = 0.24), deer (P = 0.23), and moose (P = 0.16). However, low-density stands (similar to 500 stems/ha) had ca. 3-20 times as many deer pellet-groups, and ca. 2-4 times as many moose pellet-groups, than other stands. Low-density stands had significantly greater canopy openness, volume of shrubs &lt; 2 m, and horizontal hiding cover &lt; 1.6 m than other treatments. Relative habitat use by deer and moose was positively related to understory characteristics such as enhanced abundance of forage and security cover. These results support our hypothesis that deer and moose responded positively to enhanced volume of herbs and shrubs as well as to species diversity and structural diversity of conifers and overall vegetation in heavily thinned (&lt;= 1000 stems/ha) stands at 12-15 years post-thinning. Our results suggest that ungulate management would be enhanced if greater emphasis was placed on forage enhancement throughout the year, which differs from current management recommendations which tend to focus on winter range and snow-interception cover.

This study was designed to test the hypotheses that large-scale stand thinning, at a 15-year period after PCT, would enhance: (i) productivity and structural features (crown volume, diameter, height, and volume growth of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) crop trees); and (ii) coniferous stand structure (abundance, species diversity, and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers). Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 stems/ha (low), similar to 1000 stems/ha (medium), and similar to 2000 stems/ha (high), with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. An overall analysis of tree growth in thinned stands, across these regional replicates, indicated that lodgepole pine grew significantly faster in mean diameter in the low- than either of the medium- or high-density stands. There was no difference in mean height growth among stand densities over the 15-year period since PCT. Mean tree volume increment was significantly higher in the low-density than in the high-density stands. Mean stand volume increment (m(3)/ha) was similar in the medium-density (108.53) and high-density (132.51) stands, both of which were significantly higher than the low-density stands (72.88). Mean crown volume of crop trees was significantly greater in the low-density (52.8 m(3)) and medium-density (42.9 m(3)) stands than in the high-density (27.8 m(3)), unthinned (11.7 m(3)), or old-growth stands (30.9 m(3) pine only). This measure of crown size was similar among pine trees in the low-density, medium-density, and all conifers (43.2 m 3) in the old-growth stands. Other measurements of crown architecture followed this same pattern. Mean densities of understory trees were similar among stands for height classes up to 3 m. Mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers were highest in the low- and medium-density stands than in other treatment stands. Our results support the hypotheses that PCT enhances productivity (diameter and volume growth, but not height growth) and structural features (crown architecture) of young lodgepole pine, as well as diversity of coniferous tree layers in thinned stands. Accelerated development of some structural features of late-seral forest appeared in our young managed stands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Forest floor small mammal communities were sampled intensively in 2000, 2001, and 2002 at 12-14-years after the pre-commercial thinning treatment. Mean total abundance of small mammals was similar among stands with the highest overall numbers recorded in 2002. Mean species richness and diversity of small mammals were similar among stands. Mean abundance of C. gapperi was similar among stands and increased significantly with time. This pattern of abundance of C. gapperi will Rely be consistent except perhaps in years of high numbers when productivity of this species may be highest in old-growth forest. Reproduction, recruitment, and early juvenile survival of C. gapperi was similar among stands; Jolly-Seber skimmer survival was higher in the thinned than unthinned stands with no difference in winter survival among stands. Our results supported hypotheses (i) and (ii) that abundance and diversity of forest floor small mammals and the demographic attributes of C. gapperi populations would be maintained in young managed lodgepole pine stands (thinned or unthinned) at levels recorded in old-growth forest.

This study was designed to test the hypothesis that herbicide-induced habitat alteration would reduce small mammal populations in early-successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest. A secondary objective was to determine the long-term influence of herbicide treatment on reproduction, survival, and growth attributes of deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) and southern red-backed vole (Clethrionomys gapperi) populations. Small mammal populations were intensively sampled in 4 pairs of control and treatment sites dominated by early-successional vegetation (5-10 yr after clearcut harvesting) near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Sampling was conducted during 1987 (pretreatment year), 1988-89 (first and second posttreatment years), and in 1991-92 (fourth and fifth posttreatment years). Higher mean numbers of red-backed voles (P = 0.03) and shrews (Sorex spp.; P = 0.001) were present on control than treatment sites during 1988-92. Mean abundance of meadow voles (Microncs pennsylvanicus; P = 0.69) and deer mice (P = 0.20) were similar on control and treatment sites throughout the study Short-tailed weasels (Mustela erminea) and long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata) were commonly captured on both control and treatment sites. There were no consistent differences between control and treatment populations in body mass, total biomass, or proportion of adult male and female red-backed voles and deer mice in breeding condition. However, there was a higher mean number of successful pregnancies in control than treatment populations of red-backed voles (P = 0.02) but not deer mice (P = 0.18) during posttreatment years. Mean Jolly-Seber estimates of survival of red-backed voles (P = 0.01) but not deer mice (P = 0.70) were higher in treatment than control populations. The magnitude of observed demographic effects from herbicide treatment were well within the mean values of natural fluctuations of these variables. Herbicide treatment of areas dominated by early-successional vegetation in northern coniferous forests should be staggered in time and space to allow recovery (2-3 yr) of vegetation and small mammal species such as red-backed voles and shrews.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;53</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Lautenschlager, RA</author><author>Wagner, RG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of glyphosate on vegetation dynamics in different successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest</title><secondary-title>WEED TECHNOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WEED TECHNOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>439-446</pages><volume>10</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>CLEARCUTS</keyword><keyword>HABITAT</keyword><keyword>forest management</keyword><keyword>shrubs</keyword><keyword>species richness and diversity</keyword><keyword>conifer release</keyword><keyword>[N-(phosphonylmethyl)glycine]</keyword><keyword>forest plantations</keyword><keyword>glyphosphate</keyword><keyword>herbs</keyword><keyword>hybrid interior spruce</keyword><keyword>Picea engelmannii Parry x P-glauca (Moench) Voss</keyword><keyword>plant communities</keyword><keyword>trees</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0890-037X,1550-2740</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0890037X00040197</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study was designed to evaluate changes in plant biomass, species richness, and diversity after application of glyphosate herbicide in several successional stages of sub-boreal spruce forest near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Vegetation was sampled in replicate control (reference) and treatment blocks of ''herb,'' ''shrub,'' and ''shrub-tree'' stages of cutover forest habitats. Volume of herb layers declined temporarily in the first post-treatment year. Shrub layers were reduced in herb and shrub stages, and shrubs and trees were reduced temporarily in the shrub-tree stage. Species richness of herbs and shrubs was similar in control and treatment blocks in the herb successional stage, but shrub richness declined on the treatment in the shrub stage. There were no consistent differences in numbers of herb, shrub, or tree species between control and treatment blocks in the shrub-tree stage. Species diversity (Simpson's index and Shannon-Wiener function) of herbaceous plants was not affected by herbicide application in any of the successional stages, but diversity of shrubs was lower in treatment than control blocks in the herb and shrub stages. Diversity of trees was reduced on treatment blocks in the shrub-tree stage. Species abundance curves of overall plant communities showed little change in the herb stage, a decline in the first post-treatment year in the shrub and shrub-tree stages, with similar patterns between control and treatment blocks in subsequent post-treatment years. The general lack of community-wide reductions in plant biomass and diversity, and the short-term duration of specific changes, suggest that conifer release treatments of plantations have no substantial, incremental effects on wildlife habitat.

An additional objective included integration of stand protection with an optimum thinning regime for growth rates of crop trees. Study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of approximate to 500 (low), 1000 (medium), and 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned/juvenile Fine stand and old-growth pine stand for comparison. Squirrel populations were sampled intensively in the thinned stands from 1989 to 1991; feeding damage was assessed annually from 1989 to 1993. Five-year diameter and height increments of crop trees were measured in the thinned stands at Penticton and Prince George, and 4-yr increments in these stands at Kamloops. Red squirrel populations were significantly reduced in the low-density stand compared with either the medium- or high-density stands at Penticton and Prince George. Squirrels were less abundant in both the low- and medium-density stands at Kamloops. Squirrel populations in the unthinned and old-growth stands were similar or lower in abundance than those in the thinned stands. There were significantly higher numbers of red squirrel first captures in the medium- and high-density stands than in the low-density stand. There were no consistent significant differences between stands in proportion of squirrels breeding, recruitment, mean survival over summer and winter periods, or mean body mass. More tries per hectare were damaged in the high than in either low- or medium-density stands at all study areas. Mean diameter increments of trees in the low-density stands were significantly higher than there in the medium- and high-density stands at all study areas. Trees grew significantly faster in height in the high- than in the low-density stands at Penticton and Prince George; the converse was true at Kamloops. Manipulation of stand density on an operational basis in young lodgepole pine has clearly indicated that both stand protection from squirrel feeding damage and productivity of crop trees are enhanced by reducing the number of stems per hectare. This result has been achieved in replicated study areas covering three different forest ecological zones.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Klenner, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Response of northwestern chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) to variable habitat structure in young lodgepole pine forest</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE ZOOLOGIE</full-title></periodical><pages>283-293</pages><volume>78</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>MARK</keyword><keyword>DAMAGE</keyword><keyword>DENSITY</keyword><keyword>POPULATION-DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>FOOD</keyword><keyword>OREGON</keyword><keyword>OLD-GROWTH FORESTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4301</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjz-78-2-283</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study was designed to test the hypothesis that large-scale habitat alteration by stand thinning over a range of densities would increase the abundance and related population dynamics of northwestern chipmunks (Tamias amoenus) in young lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest. Replicate study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of approximate to 500 (low), 1000 (medium), and 2000 (high) stems/ha, with an unthinned young pine stand and an old-growth pine stand for comparison. Chipmunk populations were sampled intensively in thinned stands from 1989 to 1991 and in the unthinned and old-growth stands from 1990 to 1991. Habitat structure was sampled in all stands in 1990. For herbs and shrubs, the crown volume index values were similar among stands; for trees, this index was lowest for the low-density stands, with the index for all three thinned stands being lower than that for the unthinned stands. Species diversity and the structural diversity of vegetation were similar among stands. The abundance of chipmunks was significantly higher in low-density than in high-density thinned stands at Penticton (1.3-1.9 times higher) and Prince George (2.4-3.8 times higher) but not at Kamloops. Chipmunks were less abundant in old-growth stands than in the other four treatment stands. Breeding performance and recruitment followed the same pattern as abundance. Chipmunk survival was generally similar among stands. There were heavier chipmunks in the low-density stands in some years at Penticton. Northwestern chipmunks appear to prefer "open" habitats generated by heavy thinning of young lodgepole pine stands. This result was achieved in three different forest ecological zones and may enhance the overall forest ecosystem.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Hao, JZ</author><author>Li, HL</author><author>Wang, SC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of small mammal populations and diversity in Northeast China an Northwest Canada.</title><secondary-title>NORTHWEST SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NORTHWEST SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>189-195</pages><volume>67</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0029-344X</isbn><abstract>This study was designed to compare small mammal populations and diversity in similar cutover forest habitats in northeast China (Langxiang, Heilongjiang Province) and northwest Canada (Prince George, British Columbia). Populations were sampled on replicate live-trap grids during a period of high numbers of small mammals in autumn at each of the respective study areas. The brown-backed vole (Clethrionomys rufocanus) in China and the meadow vole (Microtus pennsylvanicus) in Canada dominated their respective communities with Jolly-Seber population estimates ranging from 59 to 104 voles/ha. Secondary major species included the northern red-backed vole (C. rutilus), Japanese field mouse (Apodemus speciosus), and striped field mouse (A. agrarius) in China, and the boreal red-backed vole (C gapperi) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) in Canada. Total average numbers of individuals were quite similar in each of the China (207) and Canada (209.5) communities. A greater biomass of small mammal species occurred at Langxiang (5.3 kg) than Prince George (4.2 kg) due to significantly larger body weights of C rufocanus and A. speciosus than M. pennsylvanicus and P. maniculatus, respectively. Diversity measurements were similar, but species richness was somewhat higher in the small mammal community at Prince George than Langxiang. There was generally a remarkable similarity in relative abundance and diversity of small mammal species occupying young cutover forest lands in northeast China and northwest Canada. This similarity suggests that the principles of managing temperate forests for wildlife diversity in North America could be applied to similar forests in Asia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Crump, DR</author><author>Wieser, H</author><author>Dixon, EA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of the plan antifeedant, Pinosylvin, on suppression of feeding by Snowshoe hares.</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ECOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>1151-1164</pages><volume>18</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>SELECTION</keyword><keyword>DAMAGE</keyword><keyword>POPULATION-DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>LODGEPOLE PINE</keyword><keyword>BALSAM POPLAR</keyword><keyword>CROP PROTECTION</keyword><keyword>DEFENSE</keyword><keyword>DETERRENTS</keyword><keyword>FEEDING SUPPRESSION</keyword><keyword>FOREST PLANTATION</keyword><keyword>GREEN ALDER</keyword><keyword>HERBIVORE</keyword><keyword>LEPUS-AMERICANUS</keyword><keyword>METHYL-ETHER</keyword><keyword>MICROTUS-PENNSYLVANICUS</keyword><keyword>PINOSYLVIN</keyword><keyword>PINOSYLVIN METHYL ETHER</keyword><keyword>PLANT ANTIFEEDANTS</keyword><keyword>RELEASE DEVICES</keyword><keyword>SNOWSHOE HARE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0098-0331</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00980070</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study investigated the influence of the plant antifeedants, pinosylvin and pinosylvin methyl ether (PME), on suppression of feeding by snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus). Screening bioassays showed clearly that pinosylvin suppressed feeding by hares when sprayed directly on coniferous tree seedlings. Pinosylvin odor, when associated with food (but not mixed with it), also significantly reduced consumption of rabbit chow by hares. Large pen bioassays indicated that both pinosylvin and PME significantly reduced feeding on tree seedlings by hares when the antifeedants were sprayed directly on trees. In field bioassays near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, pinosylvin sprayed on trees and encapsulated in controlled-release devices of PVC plastic, with an internal wire as a twist-tie for attachment to tree, significantly reduced feeding by hares. Thus, pinosylvin will generate an "avoidance response" in terms of feeding by snowshoe hares. This response is likely triggered by an olfactory pathway based on positive results with controlled-release devices attached to seedlings. Our study reports the first practical utilization of plant antifeedants for forest crop protection and wildlife management.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author><author>Coates, H</author><author>Jozsa, LA</author><author>Diggle, PK</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of feeding damage by small mammals on tree growth and wood wuality in young Lodgepole Pine</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</full-title></periodical><pages>799-809</pages><volume>23</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>BARKING DAMAGE</keyword><keyword>CENTRAL BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>SNOWSHOE HARES</keyword><keyword>RED SQUIRRELS</keyword><keyword>STANDS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/x93-104</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study assessed the impact of feeding injuries by snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus Erxleben) and red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus Erxleben) on diameter growth, height growth, and wood quality of juvenile lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. var latifolia Engelm.) at Prince George and in the Cariboo Region, British Columbia. In the Prince George control stand, severe girdling damage (50-99% stem circumference) suppressed diameter and height growth of small-diameter (4.1-6.0 cm) trees, but had no effect on larger stems (6.1-8.0 cm). In the spaced stand, diameter and height increments also declined significantly with degree of partial girdling, particularly in small-diameter (3.1-5.0 cm) trees. Paradoxically, diameter increment increased significantly with degree of partial girdling in both stands at the Cariboo study area. Presumably squirrels prefer to feed on vigorous stems, and the lost growth of these trees may be substantial. There was no significant difference in amount of compression wood nor total solvent and water extractives between undamaged and damaged trees. Fiber lengths in wound-associated wood were consistently 19-21% lower than in controls. Damaged trees had greater average ring width and density than undamaged trees. The average increase in relative density of damaged over undamaged trees was 0.0343. These results suggest that a severe degree of partial girdling (which likely occurs more often in small-diameter trees) may significantly affect growth of lodgepole pine, particularly small (&lt;5.0 cm DBH) trees.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sullivan, TP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of herbicide-induced habitat alteration on vegetation and snowshoe hare populations in sub-boreal spruce forest</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>717-730</pages><volume>31</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>MARK</keyword><keyword>SELECTION</keyword><keyword>GLYPHOSATE</keyword><keyword>DAMAGE</keyword><keyword>FOREST SUCCESSION</keyword><keyword>LEPUS AMERICANUS</keyword><keyword>PLANT BIOMASS</keyword><keyword>POPULATION DENSITY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8901</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/2404162</electronic-resource-num><abstract>1.

Proportion of adult hares in breeding condition and number of successful pregnancies showed no consistent differences between control and treatment populations. Recruitment of hares was generally similar except for significantly more juvenile females entering the control than treatment population at one study area. At a second study area, total recruitment was significantly higher in the treatment than control population for both sexes in 1990 and for adult females in 1991, the 2 post-treatment years. There was little difference in survival of hares between control and treatment populations. Lack of significant differences in mean body mass and growth rates suggested that this herbicide treatment had little or no effect on metabolic or general physiological processes in the development of young hares. Similar profiles of body mass distribution between control and treatment populations indicated that comparable levels of biomass of hares were available as prey for predators. Use of this forest herbicide did not measurably affect demographic parameters of snowshoe hare populations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stumpf, AJ</author><author>Broster, BE</author><author>Levson, VM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multiphase flow of the late Wisconsinan Cordilleran ice sheet in western Canada</title><secondary-title>GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA BULLETIN</full-title></periodical><pages>1850-1863</pages><volume>112</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>CENTRAL BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>ALBERTA</keyword><keyword>LAURENTIDE</keyword><keyword>PLEISTOCENE</keyword><keyword>GLACIATION</keyword><keyword>RATES</keyword><keyword>ADVANCE</keyword><keyword>COAST</keyword><keyword>CONTINENTAL-SHELF</keyword><keyword>Cordilleran</keyword><keyword>divides</keyword><keyword>ice flows</keyword><keyword>ice sheet</keyword><keyword>Quaternary</keyword><keyword>RETREAT</keyword><keyword>western Canada</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0016-7606</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112&lt;1850:MFOTLW&gt;2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In central British Columbia, ice flow during the late Wisconsinan Fraser glaciation (ca. 25-10 ka) occurred in three phases. The ice expansion phase occurred during an extended period when glaciers flowed westward to the Pacific Ocean and east-southeastward onto the Nechako Plateau from ice centers in the Skeena, Hazelton, Coast, and Omineca Mountains. Initially, glacier how was confined by topography along major valleys, but eventually piedmont and montane glaciers coalesced to form an integrated glacier system, the Cordilleran ice sheet. In the maximum phase, a Cordilleran ice divide developed over the Nechako Plateau to 300 km inland from the Pacific coast. At this time, the surface of the ice sheet extended well above 2500 m above sea level, and flowed westward over the Skeena, Hazelton, and Coast Mountains onto the continental shelf and eastward across the Rocky Mountains into Alberta. In the late glacial phase, a rapid rise of the equilibrium line caused ice lobes to stagnate in valleys, and restricted accumulation centers to high mountains. Discordant directions in ice how are attributed to fluctuations of the ice divide representing changes in the location of accumulation centers and ice thickness. Ice centers probably shifted in response to climate, irregular growth in the ice sheet, rapid calving, ice streaming, and drainage of proglacial and subglacial mater bodies. Crosscutting ice-flow indicators and preservation of early (valley parallel) flow features in areas exposed to later (cross-valley) glacier erosion indicate that the ice expansion phase was the most erosive and protracted event.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;53</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Struik, LC</author><author>Schiarizza, P</author><author>Orchard, MJ</author><author>Cordey, F</author><author>Sano, H</author><author>MacIntyre, DG</author><author>Lapierre, H</author><author>Tardy, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imbricate architecture of the upper Paleozoic to Jurassic oceanic Cache Creek Terrane, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>495-514</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>BLUESCHISTS</keyword><keyword>LAWSONITE</keyword><keyword>NORTH-AMERICAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>PINCHI LAKE</keyword><keyword>PRESSURE-TEMPERATURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-117</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Upper Paleozoic to Lower Jurassic oceanic rocks of the Cache Creek Terrane near Fort St. James, in central British Columbia, form a stack of thrust sheets cut by steeply dipping strike-slip faults. Paleontologically dated upper Paleozoic strata include bioclastic shallow-water limestone and ribbon chert. Isotopically dated Permian rocks consist of tonalite sills and stocks and rhyolite flows intercalated with basalt flows. Paleontologically dated lower Mesozoic rocks include greywacke, sandstone, siltstone, argillite, ribbon chert, conglomerate, limestone, and basalt tuff. Trembleur Ultramafite unit of the Cache Creek Complex, in places part of an ophiolite suite, forms thrust sheets and klippen that overlie lower Mesozoic sedimentary rocks. Sedimentological, lithochemical, paleontological, petrological, and textural comparisons with other areas and established models demonstrate that Cache Creek Terrane is an accretionary complex, a structurally stacked assemblage of rocks that originated in diverse and disparate oceanic paleoenvironments. These environments include spreading ridge, oceanic plateau, atoll, trench fill, and possibly arc. Internal imbrication of the terrane is as young as Early Jurassic, as determined from fossil evidence, and the minimum age of obduction of the thrust stack westward onto Stikine Terrane is Middle Jurassic, as determined from dating of a crosscutting pluton. Triassic blueschist and eclogite of Cache Creek Terrane are interpreted to have been primarily uplifted to upper crustal levels during Triassic subduction. Cache Creek Terrane, as a remnant of that subduction process, and caught in the collision between Stikine and Quesnel terranes, marks the position of a lithosphere-scale suture zone, the Pinchi Suture.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;67</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Struik, LC</author><author>MacIntyre, DG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Introduction to the special issue of Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences: The Nechako NATMAP Project of the central Canadian Cordillera.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>485-494</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CENTRAL BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e01-019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Canadian Cordillera in central British Columbia has seen the Mesozoic subduction of an oceanic terrane; the amalgamation of volcanic-arc terranes; continued intermittent Mesozoic compression and magmatism; and Tertiary wrenching, extension and magmatism. Except in its northernmost mountain ranges, the area is extensively covered in glacial drift and thin veneers of Tertiary volcanic rocks. In 1994, a group of scientists and technologists believed they could understand that cover, see through it, and discover the components of that collision and extensional orogen. They would apply modern techniques of isotopic and paleontological geochronology; lake-sediment, till, and plant geochemistry; detailed gravity, magnetic, radiometric, paleomagnetic, and electromagnetic surveys; and isotopic and trace element lithochemistry, as they conducted extensive bedrock and surficial mapping. This special issue summarizes a cross-section of the scientific contributions derived from that mapping conducted under the auspices of the Nechako NATMAP Project. It demonstrates the absolute necessity of applying modern isotopic and paleontologic geochronology to understand the Phanerozoic geology of the Cordillera. It emphasizes the necessity of detailed aeromagnetic surveys (500 m or less line spacing) in looking through covered terranes at anything more than 1 : 250 000 scale. And, it shows the immense utility of applying various geochemical techniques to solve geological problems and establish baselines for future research and economic development. Bedrock and surficial mapping in the central Cordillera, using these and other techniques, have established the nature and timing of Mesozoic crustal growth, Tertiary crustal thinning, and the associated formation of mineral deposits.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stout, DG</author><author>Broersma, K</author><author>Acharya, SN</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seed preinoculation and soil liming for growth of forage legumes on acidic clay soils</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>51-57</pages><volume>128</volume><keywords><keyword>YIELD</keyword><keyword>ALFALFA</keyword><keyword>CLOVER</keyword><keyword>MULTIPLE ELEMENT EXTRACTANT</keyword><keyword>NODULATION</keyword><keyword>RHIZOBIA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8596</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0021859696003905</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Forages produced in the north central interior of British Columbia are low in percentage crude protein (CP). Growing lucerne (Medicago sativa L.) should increase forage percentage CP, but many of the soils are considered too acidic for this species. The objective of three held experiments, conducted at the Prince George experimental farm, was to evaluate management practices that might accommodate the growth of lucerne on acid soils without the expense of liming. Experiment 1 compared three legume species (lucerne, alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) and red clover (T. pratense L.)), preinoculated lime-coated seed (GNR(TM), Grow Tec Ltd, Nisku, Alberta), and soil liming on root nodulation and forage dry matter (DM) yield. Experiment 2 compared lucerne genetic lines, seed preinoculation and soil liming on root nodulation and forage DM yield and percentage CP. Experiment 3 compared lucerne rhizobia genetic strains, seed preinoculation and soil liming on root nodulation, forage DM yield and percentage CP. For effective nodulation, lucerne required seed preinoculation, whereas alsike clover and red clover did not. Lucerne persisted longer than alsike or red clover. In Expts 2 and 3, the combination of lime and preinoculation increased lucerne DM yield by 136% and %CP from 9.2 to 15.4. The addition of lime alone increased lucerne DM yield by an average of 130% and %CP from 9.2 to 16.3. With preinoculation alone, lucerne DM yield increased by 100% and %CP increased from 9.2 to 12.7. Although using preinoculated lime-coated seed alone is not as effective as lime alone, coated seed may be the preferred method, based on ease of application and cost. Neither the six lucerne lines nor the three rhizobial strains evaluated resulted in improved root nodulation under acidic conditions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stone, D</author><author>Griffing, TC</author><author>Knight, MC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Biological monitoring of Fraser River near Prince-George, BC</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>T110-T116</pages><volume>75</volume><number>MAR</number><issue>MAR</issue><dates><year>1974</year><pub-dates><date>1974</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stoehr, MU</author><author>L'Hirondelle, SJ</author><author>Binder, WD</author><author>Webber, JE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Parental environment aftereffects on germination, growth, and adaptive traits in selected white spruce families</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</full-title></periodical><pages>418-426</pages><volume>28</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>AUTUMN FROST-HARDINESS</keyword><keyword>DIFFERENT LATITUDES</keyword><keyword>FERTILIZATION</keyword><keyword>PICEA-ABIES PROGENIES</keyword><keyword>POLLEN</keyword><keyword>SEEDLINGS</keyword><keyword>SEXUAL REPRODUCTION</keyword><keyword>WILD</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfr-28-3-418</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Seed orchards for the production of conifer seed in British Columbia are usually located in areas favorable (warm and dry) for flowering and seed development, often considerably south of the source location of the parent trees. Differences in environmental conditions between seed orchard location and location of origin can affect progeny performance. It is suspected that this is caused by environmental factors that affect reproductive processes of parent trees and lead to altered physiological traits (aftereffects). This study examined if aftereffects are present in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Control pollinations were made at two locations, Red Rock, near Prince George (53 degrees N) in central British Columbia, and Kalamalka, near Vernon (50 degrees N) in southern British Columbia, on five female trees using a four-male polymix. Identical genotypes through grafting were present at the two locations. Pollen maturing at each site was only used in the polymix at that particular location. Progeny were raised and germination traits, number of needle primordia, greenhouse and field heights, and frost hardiness were evaluated in a common environment. The location of seed development significantly affected all traits evaluated. Height growth aftereffects in the second field season were much less than those observed in the first field season. These results suggest that aftereffects are detectable in white spruce progeny performance in British Columbia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stephenson, AL</author><author>Spence, GD</author><author>Wang, K</author><author>Hole, JA</author><author>Miller, KC</author><author>Clowes, RM</author><author>Harder, SH</author><author>Kaip, GM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crustal velocity structure of the southern Nechako basin, British Columbia, from wide-angle seismic traveltime inversion</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1050-1063</pages><volume>48</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>BELTS</keyword><keyword>INTERMONTANE</keyword><keyword>OMINECA</keyword><keyword>TOMOGRAPHY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E11-006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the BATHOLITHSonland seismic project, a refraction wide-angle reflection survey was shot in 2009 across the Coast Mountains and Interior Plateau of central British Columbia. Part of the seismic profile crossed the Nechako Basin, a Jurassic-Cretaceous basin with potential for hydrocarbons within sedimentary strata that underlies widespread volcanic rocks. Along this 205 km-long line segment, eight large explosive shots were fired into 980 seismometers. Forward and inverse modelling of the traveltime data were conducted with two independent methods: ray-tracing based modelling of first and secondary arrivals, and a higher resolution wavefront-based first-arrival seismic tomography. Material with velocities less than 5.0 km/s is interpreted as sedimentary rocks of the Nechako Basin, while velocities from 5.0-6.0 km/s may correspond to interlayered sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The greatest thickness of sedimentary rocks in the basin is found in the central 110 km of the profile. Two sub-basins were identified in this region, with widths of 20-50 km and maximum sedimentary depths of 2.5 and 3.3 km. Such features are well-defined in the velocity model, since resolution tests indicate that features with widths greater than similar to 13 km are reliable. Beneath the sedimentary rocks, seismic velocities increase more slowly with depth - from 6.0 km/s just below the basin to 6.3 km/s at similar to 17 km in depth, and then to 6.8-7.0 km/s at the base of the crust. The Moho is found at a depth of 33.5-35 km beneath the profile, and mantle velocities are high at 8.05-8.10 km/s.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Steiner, MB</author><author>Helsey, CE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paleomagnetic results from Jurassic-Topley intrusions near Endako, Britisth Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>349-350</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1974</year><pub-dates><date>1974</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e74-031</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Stauffer, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>'You people talk from paper': Indigenous law, western legalism, and the cultural variability of law's materials</title><secondary-title>LAW TEXT CULTURE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>LAW TEXT CULTURE</full-title></periodical><pages>40-57</pages><volume>23</volume><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1322-9060,2200-7121</isbn><abstract>While researching aspects of indigenous oral history in the western part of what is currently called Canada, I encountered an anecdote from a Southern Tutchone elder from the Yukon. This elder, Mrs. Annie Ned, was criticizing a group of scientists at a joint conference of scientists and indigenous persons involved in environmental issues facing the polar and sub-polar regions of Canada. She said to the scientists: 'You people talk from paper' (Cruikshank 1998: 45). In this essay I will discuss why and how this phrase functions as potent criticism of how western law and science deal with indigenous groups in settler colonial societies and, perhaps, how western law and science deal with knowledge in general. To do that I'll look at a case where two different kinds of legal tradition come into conflict-in part because of what each of them takes to be law's materials. The case is called Delgamuukw v. British Columbia (hereinafter Delgamuukw). The conflict is between Canada and two indigenous groups-the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en- residing in what is currently called British Columbia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Starheim, CCA</author><author>Smith, DJ</author><author>Prowse, TD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dendrohydroclimate reconstructions of July-August runoff for two nival-regime rivers in west central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>405-420</pages><volume>27</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW</keyword><keyword>GLACIER MASS-BALANCE</keyword><keyword>ABIES-LASIOCARPA</keyword><keyword>CLIMATIC VARIABILITY</keyword><keyword>Coast Mountains</keyword><keyword>dendrochronology</keyword><keyword>hydroclimate</keyword><keyword>ring density</keyword><keyword>ring width</keyword><keyword>river discharge</keyword><keyword>SNOWMELT RUNOFF</keyword><keyword>SNOWPACK</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN COAST MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>SUB-ALPINE FIR</keyword><keyword>TRENDS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087,1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.9257</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lengthy records of river discharge are necessary to comprehensively assess the long-term connection between synoptic climate forcings and nival-regime systems in British Columbia. A regional multispecies network of tree-ring width and ring density chronologies was built for west central British Columbia with the intention of dendrohydrologically extending short runoff records in this area. Extended records of July-August mean discharge anomalies for the Skeena and Atnarko Rivers were reconstructed back to AD 1660. Low flow events represented during the late 1600s, early 1700s and late 1800s lie beyond those experienced during the recent instrumental period for these basins. The documentation of extreme events of this magnitude necessitates consideration when planning for future water resources in this region. Supplementary dendroclimatic reconstructions of the winter Pacific North American (PNA) pressure anomaly pattern and records of mean summer temperature and end-of-winter snow water equivalent were also constructed. These ancillary climate records provide insight into the long-term climate drivers of annual discharge dynamics within these nival basins. Correlation and wavelet analyses confirm the persistent relationship of synoptic climate regimes described by the Southern Oscillation Index, NINO 3.4, Pacific Decadal Oscillation and PNA indices on runoff in west central British Columbia.

Analysis of distortion effects and structural dimensionality indicate that the MT responses are primarily one-dimensional (1-D) at periods less than 0.1 s. Departures from a 1-D response occur with maximum phase differences occurring between 0.1 and 10 s. The upper crustal resistivity models reveal a low resistivity layer at near surface depths, interpreted as Chilcotin basalts, that blankets portions of the region to depths less than 50 m, but locally thicken up to 200 m. Cretaceous sedimentary units (those showing the highest potential for hydrocarbons) are characterized by moderately low resistivities that are laterally variable. More uniform, lower resistivities appear to be associated with the Eocene volcaniclastic groups, suggesting that the MT method can distinguish between these units and may be useful in targeting areas that are more prospective for hydrocarbon exploration. In general midcrustal resistivity values are high, consistent with values of typical volcanic terranes; however, a low-resistivity zone is identified at 8-10 km depth that correlates closely with the location of seismic reflectors as well as recent microseismic activity. This low-resistivity zone is interpreted as a midcrustal reservoir of magma, the top of which marks the upper limit of fluids migrating from lower crust depths. Additionally, several crustal-scale faults are imaged.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spittal, PM</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Chavoshi, N</author><author>Christian, WM</author><author>Moniruzzaman, A</author><author>Teegee, M</author><author>Schechter, MT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: high incidence of HCV infections in a longitudinal study of young Aboriginal people who use drugs in two Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>BMC PUBLIC HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMC PUBLIC HEALTH</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><keywords><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>PREVALENCE</keyword><keyword>SEX WORK</keyword><keyword>WOMEN</keyword><keyword>HIV-INFECTION</keyword><keyword>BEHAVIORS</keyword><keyword>HEPATITIS-C VIRUS</keyword><keyword>PRIMARY RISK-FACTOR</keyword><keyword>VULNERABILITIES</keyword><keyword>YOUTH</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1471-2458</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/1471-2458-12-632</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Factors associated with HCV incidence among young Aboriginal people in Canada are still not well understood. We sought to estimate time to HCV infection and the relative hazard of risk factors associated HCV infection among young Aboriginal people who use injection drugs in two Canadian cities. Methods: The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants' venous blood samples were drawn and tested for HCV antibodies. Analysis was restricted to participants who use used injection drugs at enrolment or any of follow up visit. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of time to HCV seroconversion. Results: In total, 45 out of 148 participants seroconverted over the study period. Incidence of HCV infection was 26.3 per 100 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 16.3, 46.1) among participants who reported using injection drugs for two years or less, 14.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 7.7, 28.9) among participants who had been using injection drugs for between two and five years, and 5.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.6,10.9) among participants who had been using injection drugs for over five years. Independent associations with HCV seroconversion were involvement in sex work in the last six months (Adjusted Hazard Ratio (AHR): 1.59; 95% CI: 1.05, 2.42) compared to no involvement, having been using injection drugs for less than two years (AHR: 4.14; 95% CI: 1.91, 8.94) and for between two and five years (AHR: 2.12; 95% CI: 0.94, 4.77) compared to over five years, daily cocaine injection in the last six months (AHR: 2.47; 95% CI: 1.51, 4.05) compared to less than daily, and sharing intravenous needles in the last six months (AHR: 2.56; 95% CI: 1.47, 4.49) compared to not sharing. Conclusions: This study contributes to the limited body of research addressing HCV infection among Aboriginal people in Canada. The HCV incidence rate among Cedar Project participants who were new initiates of injection drug use underscores an urgent need for HCV and injection prevention and safety strategies aimed at supporting young people surviving injection drug use and sex work in both cities. Young people must be afforded the opportunity to provide leadership and input in the development of prevention programming.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spittal, PM</author><author>Craib, KJP</author><author>Teegee, M</author><author>Baylis, C</author><author>Christian, WM</author><author>Moniruzzaman, AKM</author><author>Schechter, MT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: Prevalence and correlates of HIV infection among young Aboriginal people who use drugs in two Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH</full-title></periodical><pages>226-240</pages><volume>66</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>drug use</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal</keyword><keyword>AIDS</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>HCV</keyword><keyword>hepatitis C</keyword><keyword>injection</keyword><keyword>RISK-FACTORS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1239-9736,2242-3982</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3402/ijch.v66i3.18259</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction. During the past decade, the number of Aboriginal people diagnosed with HIV in Canada has grown more than any other ethnicity. Whereas the majority of infections are related to injection drug use, factors that explain elevated risk and transmission of HIV among Aboriginal young people who use illicit drugs are not well understood. Study design. Observational study. Methods. The Cedar Project is an observational study of Aboriginal youth living in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Eligibility criteria include age (14-30 years) and self-reported use of non-injection or injection drugs at least once in the month before enrolment. Between October 2003 and April 2005, 512 participants were recruited and completed a questionnaire administered by an Aboriginal interviewer. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to model the independent association of demographic and behavioural variables of individuals with HIV infection. Results. Of the participants, 235 resided in Prince George and 277 in Vancouver. Among the 276 participants that used injection drugs, HIV prevalence was significantly higher in Vancouver (17% vs. 7%) but HCV prevalence was higher in Prince George (62% vs. 57%). In Vancouver, 40% of injectors reported daily heroine use compared with 12% in Prince George. In contrast, Prince George participants were more likely to report daily injection of cocaine compared with those in Vancouver (37% vs. 21%). A higher percentage of Prince George participants reported having difficulty accessing clean syringes (22% vs. 8%). History of non-consensual sex, residing in Vancouver and duration of injection drug use were independent factors associated with increased risk of HIV infection. Conclusions. HIV and HCV prevalence are elevated in young Aboriginal drug users residing in Vancouver and Prince George. Heterogeneity exists in these locations with respect to drug of choice and access to clean syringes. Prevention and treatment programs are urgently required in this population.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;43 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;43 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spence, C</author><author>Hedstrom, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Baker Creek Research Watershed: Streamflow data highlighting the behaviour of an intermittent Canadian Shield stream through a wet-dry-wet cycle</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><volume>35</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>PART</keyword><keyword>permafrost</keyword><keyword>Precambrian Shield</keyword><keyword>research basin</keyword><keyword>subarctic</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087,1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.14038</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Baker Creek drains water from subarctic Canadian Shield terrain comprised of a mix of exposed Precambrian bedrock, lakes, open black spruce forest and peat filled depressions. Research in the catchment has focused on hydrological processes at the hillslope and catchment scales. Streamflow is gauged from several diverse sub-catchments ranging in size from 9 to 155 km(2). The period of record (2003-2019) of streamflow from these sub-catchments extends from 12 to 17 years, and these data are the focus of this note. Such data are unique in this remote region. 2003-2019 was a period that included both historic wet and dry conditions. Observations during such a diversity of conditions are helping to improve understanding of how stream networks that drain this landscape expand and contract in response to short and long hydroclimatic cycles. These data from a distinctly cold and dry region of low relief, thin soils, exposed bedrock and permafrost are a valuable contribution to the global diversity of research catchment data.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sparke, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A map that roared and an original atlas: Canada, cartography, and the narration of nation</title><secondary-title>ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS</full-title></periodical><pages>463-495</pages><volume>88</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CITIZENSHIP</keyword><keyword>POLITICS</keyword><keyword>SPACES</keyword><keyword>cartography</keyword><keyword>DANGER</keyword><keyword>DEBATE</keyword><keyword>GEOPOLITICS</keyword><keyword>political geography</keyword><keyword>postcolonial theory</keyword><keyword>READERS-DIGEST</keyword><keyword>the nation-state</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0004-5608,1467-8306</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/0004-5608.00109</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper contributes to recent debates about the geography of power, the nation-state, carto graphic history, and postcolonial theory. It does so by connecting the themes of these literatures and exploring empirically the claims about the narration of nation made by the postcolonial theorist Homi Bhabha, The two empirical case studies come from contemporary Canada, and concern, in part, the mapping of the nation-state The first case is a British Columbia trial in which two First Nations, the Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en, brought a case against the provincial and federal governments over the recognition of their native sovereignty. The second study is of volume 1 of the Historical Atlas of Canada, which, unlike many ochers before it, sought to place native peoples and spaces within the overarching cartography of the country. In both studies, the ambivalent (post) colonial power relations of cartography-the fact that they can work bath for and against colonialism-become evident. They therefore serve as exemplary lessons concerning the political geography of mapping and the chronic persistence into the present of colonial assumptions about cartography. But more than this, the studies also raise significant questions about the limits of Bhabha's locution of "location" as a site for a performative form of political agency. The paper suggests, therefore, that, while spatial theorists can usefully draw on Bhabha's postcolonial supplements to theories of the nation, the work of producing postcolonial,geographies of national negotiations simultaneously supplements and displaces Bhabha's own abstraction of agency.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;168 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;170 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;111</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Southgate, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Boreal cloister + University building, Prince-George, British-Columbia, Canada, Hotson-Bakker architects</title><secondary-title>ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>57-59</pages><volume>202</volume><number>1205</number><issue>1205</issue><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0003-861X</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Snauffer, AM</author><author>Hsieh, WW</author><author>Cannon, AJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of gridded snow water equivalent products with in situ measurements in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>714-726</pages><volume>541</volume><keywords><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>COVER</keyword><keyword>DEPTH</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>Alpine regions</keyword><keyword>DATA ASSIMILATION SYSTEM</keyword><keyword>Gridded product</keyword><keyword>LDAS</keyword><keyword>RADIOMETER DATA</keyword><keyword>Reanalysis</keyword><keyword>Snow course</keyword><keyword>Snow water equivalent</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1694,1879-2707</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2016.07.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Regional-scale estimates of snow water equivalent (SWE) are challenging in alpine regions, particularly in areas of high accumulation and dense forest cover, suggesting efforts to improve these estimates may benefit from an evaluation of existing gridded products. Gridded SWE products comprising four reanalysis datasets (ERA-Interim, ERA-Interim/Land, MERRA and MERRA-Land), two land data assimilation system datasets (GLDAS1 and GLDAS2) and two observation-based products (CMC and GlobSnow) have been compared with in-situ measurements over five physiographic regions in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Time series were generated for each survey month (January through June), and median correlation, bias and mean absolute error (MAE) values were found for each product and physiographic region. The best performance in correlation and magnitude of bias and MAE was seen in areas of lowest SWE accumulation and land relief (e.g. the Interior Plains of northern BC), while poorer performance was seen in regions of high accumulation and complex topography (Columbia and Rocky Mountains and Coast Mountains). Overall, the performance ranking order is ERA-Interim/Land (best), GLDAS2, MERRA, CMC, GLDAS1, MERRA-Land, GlobSnow and ERA-Interim. Crown Copyright (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Conducting a waste characterization study is a critical first step in successful waste management planning and advancing the overall sustainability of an institution of higher education. This paper reports on a waste characterization study that was conducted at the Prince George campus of the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC). The aim of the study was to determine the amount and composition of waste generated within key campus operational areas and to provide recommendations to senior university administration on strategies for waste minimization, higher rates of recycling and composting and improving the overall sustainability of the campus waste management program. It was determined that during the 2007-2008 academic year the Prince George campus produced between 1.2 and 2.2 metric tonnes of waste per week, of which more than 70% could have been diverted through waste reduction, recycling and composting activities. Paper and paper products, disposable drink containers and compostable organic material represented three of the most significant material types for targeted waste reduction and recycling efforts. Various educational and policy techniques, which may be used to promote campus community waste minimization behaviours in the long term, are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A newly developed method that combines three-dimensional (3-D) travel-time inversion and 2.5-dimensional (2.5-D) viscoacoustic full-waveform inversion was applied to generate the geophysical models from vibroseis data acquired along the preexisting crooked roads. These models are useful for the characterization of rock types in terms of their positions and thicknesses, which may be used in conjunction with geological ground truth to infer the extent of lithostratigraphic units in the subsurface. The velocity structures also may be used for future reprocessing of the seismic reflection data to derive improved images based on the better near-surface velocity models. The subsurface geology of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau region is complex, resulting from multiple stages of tectonic compression and extension, contemporaneous with the deposition of sediments and volcanic material. Several basin structures are identified from the joint interpretation of the waveform tomography velocity models and post-stack time migration images. The combination of these results enables the extrapolation and characterization of geological structures to similar to 3 km depth, particularly within the Cenozoic volcanic units that dominate near-surface stratigraphy. Based on the seismic profiles, a fence-diagram geological interpretation that extends to similar to 3 km depth illustrates the complex structure of the Jurassic to Neogene stratigraphic sequence.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smithyman, BR</author><author>Clowes, RM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Waveform tomography of field vibroseis data using an approximate 2D geometry leads to improved velocity models</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICS</full-title></periodical><pages>R33-R43</pages><volume>77</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>INVERSION</keyword><keyword>APERTURE SEISMIC DATA</keyword><keyword>FREQUENCY-DOMAIN</keyword><keyword>REFLECTION</keyword><keyword>TRAVEL-TIME</keyword><keyword>SOUTHEASTERN NECHAKO BASIN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0016-8033,1942-2156</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1190/GEO2011-0076.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Waveform tomography, a combination of traveltime tomography (or inversion) and waveform inversion, is applied to vibroseis first-arrival data to generate an interpretable model of P-wave velocity for a site in the Nechako Basin, south-central British Columbia, Canada. We use constrained 3D traveltime inversion followed by 2D full-waveform inversion to process long-offset (14.4 km) first-arrival refraction waveforms, resulting in a velocity model of significantly higher detail than a conventional refraction-statics model generated for a processing workflow. The crooked-line acquisition of the data set makes 2D full-waveform inversion difficult. Thus, a procedure that improves the tractability of waveform tomography processing of vibroseis data recorded on crooked roads is developed to generate a near-surface (&lt; 2 km) velocity model for the study area. The data waveforms are first static corrected using a time shift determined by 3D raytracing, which accounts for the crossline offsets produced by the crooked-line acquisition. The velocity model generated from waveform tomography exhibits substantial improvement when compared with a conventional refraction-statics model. It also shows improved resolution of sharp discontinuities and low-velocity regions when compared to the model from traveltime tomography alone, especially in regions where the geometry errors are moderate. Interpretation of the near-surface velocity model indicates possible subbasins in the Nechako Basin and delineates the Eocene volcanic rocks of the study area. This approach limits the ability of the full-waveform inversion to fit some propagation modes; however, the tractability of the inversion in the near-surface region is improved. This new development is especially useful in studies that do not warrant 3D seismic acquisition and processing.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smithyman, BR</author><author>Clowes, RM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Waveform tomography in 2.5D: Parameterization for crooked-line acquisition geometry</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH</full-title></periodical><pages>2119-2137</pages><volume>118</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>FIELD</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>INVERSION</keyword><keyword>FREQUENCY-DOMAIN</keyword><keyword>TRAVEL-TIME</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>5D</keyword><keyword>CROSSHOLE DATA</keyword><keyword>inversion</keyword><keyword>SEISMIC DATA</keyword><keyword>seismic refraction</keyword><keyword>STRATEGY</keyword><keyword>tomography</keyword><keyword>velocity model building</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-9313,2169-9356</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/jgrb.50100</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A method for 2.5D viscoacoustic waveform tomography that can be applied to generate 2D models of velocity and attenuation from inversion of refraction waveforms on land seismic reflection data acquired along crooked roads is developed. It is particularly useful for typical crustal reflection surveys. First-arrival travel time tomography is applied using a 3D method, but with constraints on the intermediate 3D velocity model; the result is the starting model for the next step. A 2.5D frequency-domain full-waveform inversion stage parameterizes 3D geometry in the seismic source and receiver arrays, with the assumption that the velocity and attenuation models are homogeneous in the out-of-plane direction. This approach results in superior results compared to a strictly 2D approach when the acquisition line is crooked, with a moderate increase in computational cost. A case study using data acquired in the Nechako Basin in south-central British Columbia, Canada, exemplifies and validates the procedure. The velocity model derived from 2.5D waveform tomography is compared with that from a previous study in which 2D waveform tomography was applied to the same data set and with results from 3D travel time tomography. The resolution and accuracy of the velocity model from 2.5D waveform tomography are demonstrated to be greater than those from travel time or 2D waveform tomography. A model of viscoacoustic attenuation, which was not possible in the 2D case, is also generated. These models are interpreted jointly to highlight features of geological interest, such as a sedimentary basin, basement rocks, and faults, from surface to about 3km depth.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, S.

A difficulty in trying to protect this species in the Fraser River and elsewhere is the lack of knowledge regarding their population biology. Variation in the mitochondrial DNA control region and at four microsatellite loci was examined in order to characterize white sturgeon samples from throughout the Fraser River mainstem and from a major tributary, the Nechako River. Samples from the adjacent Columbia River were analyzed for comparison. In contrast to previous work, present data indicate that white sturgeon population structure in this region reflects post-glacial dispersal more than it does recent anthropogenic effects. The data divided the Fraser into four biogeographic regions: ( i) the lower Fraser, below Hell's Gate; ( ii) the middle Fraser, between Hell's Gate and river km 553; (iii) the upper Fraser, above the Nechako confluence; and ( iv) the Nechako River. These four groups are concordant with those suggested by tag and recapture and catch per unit effort data, and are separated by what have been identified as barriers to white sturgeon migration. Based on concordance between these different types of data, it is argued that the four groups identified here merit evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) status.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slaney, PA</author><author>Rublee, BO</author><author>Perrin, CJ</author><author>Goldberg, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Debris structure placements and whole-river fertilization for Salmonids in a large regulated stream in British Columbia.</title><secondary-title>BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BULLETIN OF MARINE SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>1160-1180</pages><volume>55</volume><number>2-3</number><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>HABITAT</keyword><keyword>RESPONSES</keyword><keyword>SYSTEM</keyword><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>PHOSPHORUS</keyword><keyword>TROUT</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENTAL-IMPACT ASSESSMENT</keyword><keyword>LIMITATION</keyword><keyword>PSEUDOREPLICATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0007-4977</isbn><abstract>A 1987 Settlement Agreement between Alcan Aluminum Ltd., the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia, established a program (Nechako Fisheries Conservation Program) of ''measures'' to conserve salmon stocks in the Nechako River, Large-scale applications of several habitat measures are planned to offset the risks to chinook salmon caused by reductions in habitat quality associated with reduced flows and mid-summer temperatures. Experimental placement of debris refugia and introduction of inorganic nutrients were conducted from 1988 to 1991 in the upper river. Juvenile chinook salmon highly colonized stream-side debris structures, including rootwad-tree sweepers, floating cribs, pseudo-beaver lodges and debris catchers. Fry density was similar to that in natural woody debris cover, which is sparse in the river. Durability of the structures was low to moderate, except for debris catchers which readily withstood peak flows of 250-270 m(3).s(-1). Debris catchers were also more extensively utilized by young chinook during the rearing and migratory period in June. Mean numbers of chinook fry per structure during May, June and July (1991) were: debris catchers; 277, 522 and 40; debris bundles; 209, 85 and 17, respectively. By 1991 during June to July, most chinook fry counted along the margins of the 20-km study reach, inhabited the added debris structures. Adult rainbow trout also more extensively colonized debris structures than nonstructure sites along the river margins. An in-situ nutrient bioassay in the upper river demonstrated marked nitrogen deficiency and phosphorus co-limitation, with oligotrophic background levels at detection limits. Subsequent whole-river additions of 5-fold increases in inorganic N and P from May to July in 1989 (flow, 52 m(3).s(-1)) indicated that peak periphyton accrual, dominated by diatoms, increased an order of magnitude, and nutrient additions elevated periphyton accrual over large distances (50 km). High emigration of chinook fry confounded detection of a growth response. Debris structure placements were effective as salmonid cover, but it was unconfirmed if fertilization will augment the growth of young chinook in the upper Nechako River, as was confirmed earlier for juvenile coho salmon and steelhead trout at an oligotrophic coastal river.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;75</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skakun, RS</author><author>Wulder, MA</author><author>Franklin, SE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sensitivity of the thematic mapper enhanced wetness difference index to detect mountain pine beetle red-attack damage</title><secondary-title>REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>433-443</pages><volume>86</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>STAND</keyword><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>CLASSIFICATION</keyword><keyword>FORESTS</keyword><keyword>LANDSAT</keyword><keyword>change detection</keyword><keyword>IMAGERY</keyword><keyword>insect detection</keyword><keyword>OUTBREAK</keyword><keyword>red-attack damage</keyword><keyword>SPATIAL PATTERNS</keyword><keyword>tasseled cap</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0034-4257(03)00112-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Red-attack damage caused by mountain pine beetle (Dentroctonus ponderosa Hopkins) infestation in stands of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in the Prince George Forest Region of British Columbia was examined using multitemporal Landsat-7 ETM+ imagery acquired in 1999, 2000, and 2001. The image data were geometrically and atmospherically corrected, and processed using the Tasseled Cap Transformation (TCT) to obtain wetness indices. The final steps included pixel subtraction, enhancement, and thresholding of the wetness index differences. The resulting enhanced wetness difference index (EWDI) was used to interpret spectral patterns in stands with confirmed (through aerial survey) red-attack damage in 2001, and these EWDI patterns were compared to the patterns of reflectance in normal-colour composites. We stratified the aerial survey dataset into two levels and used the EWDI to discriminate classes of 10-29 red-attack trees and 30-50 red-attack trees, and a sample of healthy forest collected from inventory data. Classification accuracy of red-attack damage based on the EWDI ranged from 67% to 78% correct. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Upstream social policies are warranted in order to support low socio-economic status (SES) male parents and their families to achieve healthy lifestyle including healthy eating and active living.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, R</author><author>Pooyak, S</author><author>Jongbloed, K</author><author>Zamar, D</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Mazzuca, A</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: Historical, structural and interpersonal determinants of involvement in survival sex work over time among Indigenous women who have used drugs in two Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY</full-title></periodical><volume>87</volume><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>VANCOUVER</keyword><keyword>NON-INJECTION DRUGS</keyword><keyword>Substance use</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>HIV-INFECTION</keyword><keyword>VULNERABILITIES</keyword><keyword>Indigenous women</keyword><keyword>Social determinants</keyword><keyword>STREET</keyword><keyword>Survival sex work</keyword><keyword>YOUNG ABORIGINAL PEOPLE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0955-3959,1873-4758</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.drugpo.2020.103012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Indigenous women involved in survival sex work face multiple layers of discrimination, criminalization and alarming levels of intergenerational and lifetime trauma. This longitudinal study examined historical, structural and interpersonal factors associated with survival sex work involvement among Indigenous women who have used drugs in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Methods: The Cedar Project is an ongoing cohort study involving young Indigenous people who have used illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Data was collected every 6 months from 2007 to 2016 . Generalized linear mixed-effects modeling was used to model survival sex work involvement, defined as exchanging sex for money, drugs, food or shelter in the previous six months. Results: Among 292 participants, 34% reported their family always/often lived by traditional culture and 37% reported their family always/often spoke their traditional language. In contrast, 48% had a parent in residential school and 72% were removed from their biological parents. In total, 55% of women were involved in survival sex work at baseline. In adjusted analyses, those who were single (ARR: 1.91; 95% CI: 1.50?2.35), identified as two-spirit (ARR: 2.16; 95% CI: 1.36?2.91), experienced sexual assault (ARR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.22?2.58), were denied access to shelter (ARR: 1.71; 95% CI: 1.18?2.28), used crack daily (ARR: 2.85; 95% CI: 2.36?3.31), used injection drugs (ARR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.98?3.07), and were unable to access substance use treatment (ARR: 1.58; 95% CI: 1.15?2.05) were more likely to be involved in sex work. Conclusion: Indigenous-governed, wellness-based harm-reduction interventions, and structural reforms addressing housing insecurity and normalization of a culture of violence against Indigenous women, especially those involved in survival sex work, are urgently needed in Canada.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;92</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sharma, AR</author><author>Dery, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linking Atmospheric Rivers to Annual and Extreme River Runoff in British Columbia and Southeastern Alaska</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>2457-2472</pages><volume>21</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>Atmosphere</keyword><keyword>Atmosphere-land interaction</keyword><keyword>Climate variability</keyword><keyword>Climatology</keyword><keyword>Hydrology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1525-755X,1525-7541</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JHM-D-19-0281.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study quantifies the contribution of atmospheric rivers (ARs) to annual and extreme river runoff and evaluates the relationships between watershed characteristics and AR-related maximum river runoff across British Columbia and southeastern Alaska (BCSAK). Datasets used include gauged runoff from 168 unregulated watersheds, topographic characteristics of those watersheds, a regionalARcatalog, and integrated vapor transport fields for water years (WYs) 1979-2016. ARs contribute similar to 22% of annual river runoff along the Coast and Insular Mountains watersheds, which decreases inland to similar to 11% in the watersheds of the Interior Mountains and Plateau. Average association between ARs and annual maximum river runoff attains &gt;80%, &gt;50%, and &lt;50% along the watersheds of the western flanks of the Coast Mountains, the Interior Mountains, and Interior Plateau, respectively. There is no significant change in AR-related extreme annual maximum runoff across BCSAK during 1979-2016. AR conditions occur during 25 out of 32 of the flood-related natural disasters in British Columbia duringWYs 1979-2016. AR-related annual maximum runoff magnitude is significantly higher than non-AR-related annual maximum runoff for 30% of the watersheds studied. Smaller and steeper watersheds closer to the coast are more susceptible to AR-related annual maximum runoff than their inland counterparts. These results illustrate the importance of AR activity as a major control for the distribution of peak runoff in BCSAK. This work provides insights on the hydrological response of watersheds of northwestern North America to landfalling ARs that may improve flood risk assessment and disaster management in this region.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;77</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Serra, R</author><author>Opio, C</author><author>Khasa, DP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sheep vegetation management for controlling competing vegetation in young conifer plantations in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS</full-title></periodical><pages>569-578</pages><volume>88</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>SPRUCE</keyword><keyword>TIME</keyword><keyword>LODGEPOLE PINE</keyword><keyword>Conifer plantations</keyword><keyword>Growth response</keyword><keyword>Hybrid spruce</keyword><keyword>LIVESTOCK</keyword><keyword>Sheep vegetation management</keyword><keyword>Silvopastoralism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0167-4366,1572-9680</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10457-014-9701-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In British Columbia, sheep vegetation management (SVM) is a relatively new technique; thus, limited data are available for examining its benefits on conifer growth. We collected field data from young mixed-conifer plantations of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and hybrid spruce (Picea glauca x P. engelmannii) in blocks which had been grazed in 2005 and 2006 as well as from ungrazed blocks. Our main objective was to determine if sheep grazing had a significant effect on the growth of hybrid spruce. We measured stem diameter at 15 cm height above the root collar (D15) and cumulative internodal length (IL). Cumulative IL was calculated from the node corresponding to the year 2002-2010 (positions 2-10). The height to diameter ratio (height to the base of the leader (position 10)/D15; HDR) was calculated to determine if seedlings prioritized growth in terms of height or diameter. There was no significant grazing treatment effect on D15 and HDR when compared to the control treatment; however IL was significantly affected after the second grazing treatment in 2006 (position 6) and became increasingly important with time (positions 7-10). Based on our results, we suggest that SVM could be an effective method for controlling competing vegetation and thus, increase annual tree growth for areas with similar site characteristics as those found within the plantations sampled.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Seneviratne, SS</author><author>Davidson, P</author><author>Martin, K</author><author>Irwin, DE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Low levels of hybridization across two contact zones among three species of woodpeckers (Sphyrapicus sapsuckers)</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF AVIAN BIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>887-898</pages><volume>47</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>AVIAN HYBRID ZONE</keyword><keyword>DIVERGENCE</keyword><keyword>DNA-SEQUENCE</keyword><keyword>GENETIC-ANALYSIS</keyword><keyword>INFERENCE</keyword><keyword>PHENOTYPIC DIFFERENTIATION</keyword><keyword>PLUMAGE</keyword><keyword>SOFTWARE</keyword><keyword>SPECIATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0908-8857,1600-048X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jav.00946</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Three species of closely related woodpeckers (sapsuckers; Sphyrapicus) hybridize where they come into contact, presenting a rare 'lambda-shape' meeting of hybrid zones. Two of the three arms of this hybrid zone are located on either side of the Interior Plateau of British Columbia, Canada bordering the foothills of the Coast Mountains and the Rocky Mountains. The third arm is located in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. The zones of hybridization present high variability of phenotypes and alleles in relatively small areas and provide an opportunity to examine levels of reproductive isolation between the taxa involved. We examined phenotypes (morphometric traits and plumage) and genotypes of 175 live birds across the two hybrid zones. We used the Genotyping By Sequencing (GBS) method to identify 180 partially diagnostic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to generate a genetic hybrid index (GHI) for each bird. Phenotypically diverged S. ruber and S. nuchalis are genetically closely related, while S. nuchalis and S. varius have similar plumage but are well separated at the genetic markers studied. The width of both hybrid zones is narrower than expected under neutrality, and analyses of both genotypes and phenotypes indicate that hybrids are rare in the hybrid zone. Rarity of hybrids indicates assortative mating and/or some form of fitness reduction in hybrids, which might maintain the species complex despite close genetic distance and introgression. These findings further support the treatment of the three taxa as distinct species.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selby, D</author><author>Nesbitt, BE</author><author>Muehlenbachs, K</author><author>Prochaska, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrothermal alteration and fluid chemistry of the Endako porphyry molybdenum deposit, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS</full-title></periodical><pages>183-201</pages><volume>95</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>COLORADO</keyword><keyword>COPPER MINERALIZATION</keyword><keyword>HYDROGEN</keyword><keyword>INCLUSION FLUIDS</keyword><keyword>ISOTOPIC FRACTIONATION</keyword><keyword>MAGMATIC FLUIDS</keyword><keyword>NEW-MEXICO</keyword><keyword>QUARTZ</keyword><keyword>SYSTEM H2O-NACL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0361-0128</isbn><abstract>Hydrothermal alteration and fluid chemistry data of the early Cretaceous Endako porphyry molybdenum deposit, British Columbia, provide new information on the hydrothermal fluids associated with low-fluorine molybdenite mineralization. Molybdenite mineralization and hydrothermal alteration occur as early quartz +/- molydenite stockwork veins with K feldspar-bearing salvages and paragenetically later quartz-molybdenite ribbon veins with sericite-bearing selvages. Late hydrothermal alteration is associated with the development of kaolinite and postore (Tertiary age) calcite veins. Fluid inclusions in early-formed quartz +/- molybdenite stockwork veins with K feldspar-bearing alteration assemblages are dominated by moderate salinity (5 to 15 wt % NaCl equiv), liquid-rich (type 1) and rare high-salinity (30 to 45 wt % NaCl equiv), halite-bearing (type 3) fluid inclusions. Type 1 and type 3 fluid inclusions in early veins homogenize between 390 degrees and 430 degrees C and 375 degrees and 420 degrees C, respectively. Secondary fluid inclusions (type 2) of low salinity (1 to 5 wt % NaCl equiv) in these early veins are minor, and homogenize between 130 degrees and 285 degrees C. Fluid inclusions in quartz-molybdenite ribbon veins with sericite-bearing alteration assemblages are dominated by moderate-salinity, liquid-rich (type 1) inclusions, with minor type 2 fluid inclusions. Type 1 fluid inclusions of ribbon veins homogenize between 360 degrees and 400 degrees C. Fluid inclusions in postore cal cite veins are of only type 2 fluid inclusions, which homogenize at 209 degrees C. Hydrothermal fluids recorded by type I and type 3 fluid inclusions in early veins were trapped under lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions between 0.3 and less than or equal to 2.0 kbar, and 360 degrees and 560 degrees C. Postore fluids recorded by type 2 fluid inclusions were trapped under conditions less than or equal to 0.5 kbar, and between 190 degrees and 300 degrees C. Quartz stockwork and ribbon Veins possess delta(18)O values of 8.4 +/- 0.2 (n = 9) and 8.4 +/- 0.6 (n = 13), respectively. Hydrothermal K feldspar and biotite from K feldspar alteration assemblages possess delta(18)O values of 6.8 +/- 0.4 (n = 7) and 3.5 +/- 0.8 (n = 8), respectively. Oxygen isotope geothermometry of quartz-biotite and quartz-K feldspar pairs from K feldspar alteration assemblages yield temperatures between 200 degrees and 490 degrees C, which is similar to the trapping temperatures of hydrothermal fluids determined from fluid inclusion studies associated with molybdenite mineralization, the development of kaolinite, and calcite veins. The oxygen isotope temperatures of the quartz-biotite and quartz-K feldspar pairs suggest that K feldspar and biotite either record the approximate O-18 composition of hydrothermal fluids associated with K feldspar alteration or have undergone O-18 exchange with late-stage hydrothermal fluids. Hydrogen isotope composition of quartz stockwork and ribbon veins fluid inclusion waters range between -105 and -113 per mil. Solute chemistry studies of fluid inclusion waters indicate that ore forming fluids from Endako have low Br/Cl and Br/Na ratios, and high I/Cl and I/Br ratios in comparison to Porgera (epithermal), Babine Lake (porphyry Cu), and St. Austell, Capitan Pluton (vein) deposits associated with magmatic processes. Na/K ratios of fluid inclusion waters yield temperatures (308 degrees to 429 degrees C) similar to those determined from type 1 and type 3 fluid inclusions and stable isotope thermometry. Results from fluid inclusion and solute chemistry studies indicate the involvement of hydrothermal fluids exsolved from a crystallizing melt in the formation of the Endako molybdenum deposit. However, oxygen and hydrogen isotope values deviate from the generally accepted magmatic compositions, which suggests the early involvement of meteoric water in the ore-forming fluids and ore genesis.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;95 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;114 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;88</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Selby, D</author><author>Creaser, RA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Re-Os geochronology and systematics in molybdenite from the Endako porphyry molybdenum deposit, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY AND THE BULLETIN OF THE SOCIETY OF ECONOMIC GEOLOGISTS</full-title></periodical><pages>197-204</pages><volume>96</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>AGES</keyword><keyword>DIGESTION</keyword><keyword>FLUID</keyword><keyword>HIGHLY PRECISE</keyword><keyword>MASS-SPECTROMETRY</keyword><keyword>OSMIUM</keyword><keyword>RHENIUM</keyword><keyword>SEPARATION</keyword><keyword>SILICATE MELTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0361-0128</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2113/96.1.197</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Precise Re-Os molybdenite ages for the Endako porphyry molybdenum deposit and the Nithi Mountain occurrence, British Columbia, Canada, yield new information on the timing of molybdenite deposition. Three episodes of mineralization are indicated: (1) similar to 154 Ma, (2) similar to 148 to 146 Ma, and (3) similar to 145 Ma. Re-Os dates agree well with new U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar data from granitoids of the Nithi phase (155.2 +/- 1.5 Ma), the Endako phase (148.4 +/- 1.5 Ma), and a preore dike (147.4 +/- 0.6 Ma), and the Casey phase (145.1 +/- 0.2. Ma), plus hydrothermal biotite (144.5 +/- 0.75 Ma; Villeneuve et al.,2001). The excellent correlation between die Re-Os dates from molybdenite and the ages of granitoids from the area indicates a direct genetic relationship between these plutons and molybdenite mineralization. These Re-Os data also provide further insight into the systematics and robustness of Re-Os in molybdenite. The Endako molybdenum deposit is tl-le product of two episodes of mineralization, both associated with moderate-salinity (5-15 wt % NaCl equiv) and high-temperature (similar to 440 degreesC) fluids; a third low-temperature (190 degrees -300 degreesC) hydrothermal event is associated with Eocene faulting (Selby et al., 2000). The clear distinction between two of the Re-Os molybdenite dates in the deposit and the close agreement of these dates to the ages of granitoid intrusions suggest that the Re-Os system in molybdenite is not reset by high-temperature (similar to 440 degreesC), moderate-salinity hydrothermal fluids. In contrast, magmatic biotite in a similar to 147 Ma preore dike has a (40)/Ar/39Ar age of similar to 145 Ma, identical to the age of the hydrothermal biotite, indicating that similar to 440 degreesC fluids reset the Ar-Ar system in biotite. Hence, we interpret that the Re-Os isotope system in molybdenite is resistant to resetting by high-temperature fluids (similar to 440 degreesC), in contrast to the 40Ar/39Ar system in biotite. The Re-Os system in molybdenite is also unaffected by postore hydrothermal fluids. These data show that molybdenite can provide critical information in understanding sulfide mineral deposition in ore systems, which is not recorded by other isotopic systems in alteration minerals.

The delineation of these management units was based primarily on population genetic analysis with samples parsed by collection location. We used polysomic microsatellite markers to examine population structure in the Fraser River system with samples parsed by collection location and with a genetic clustering algorithm. Strong levels of genetic divergence were revealed above and below Hells Gate, a narrowing of the Fraser canyon further obstructed by a rockslide in 1913. Additional analyses revealed population substructure on the Fraser River above Hells Gate. The Middle Fraser River (SG-3) and Nechako River were found to be distinct populations, while the Upper Fraser River, although currently listed as an endangered population, represented a mixing area for white sturgeon originating from SG-3 and Nechako. Differences between these results and previous genetic investigations may be attributed to the detection of population mixing when genetic clustering is used to infer population structure.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;57</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schiefer, E</author><author>Menounos, B</author><author>Wheate, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recent volume loss of British Columbian glaciers, Canada</title><secondary-title>GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS</full-title></periodical><volume>34</volume><number>16</number><issue>16</issue><keywords><keyword>SNOW</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0094-8276,1944-8007</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2007GL030780</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We use the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission ( SRTM) data and digital terrain models from aerial photography to quantify the change of glacier volume in British Columbia ( BC), Canada for the period 1985 - 1999. We note substantial elevation bias in the SRTM elevations, typically on the order of - 12 m km(-1). The bias- corrected thinning rate is -0.78 +/- 0.19 m a(-1) which yields an annual volume loss of 22.48 +/- 5.53 km(-3) a(-1). This rate of glacier volume loss is 65% of the estimate uncorrected for elevation bias (34.7 km(-3) a(-1)) and cautions against the use of uncorrected SRTM data for glacier change studies. Glacier recession in BC could account for ca. 0.67 +/- 0.12 mm of sea level rise over the period 1985 - 1999 (0.05 +/- 0.009 mm yr(-1)) or about 8.3% of the contribution from mountain glaciers and ice caps.

In Canada, Airport Wildlife Management Plans (AWMPs) are designed to provide an outline of specific wildlife hazards at airports and recommend countermeasures to minimise strike risk. Wildlife incident reports are a key component in the development of such plans. Here, wildlife incident reports were compiled and compared to data collected using newly-installed digital wildlife camera trap technology at the Prince George International Airport. Seven camera traps were monitored for a total of 2,426 sampling days (9,228 camera days) between 2009 and 2016 and recorded a total of 3,046 animals within 16 different animal species/groups. Airport personnel recorded 4,640 animals and 23 different species/ groups during the same period. Camera traps recorded almost five times as many animals (n = 2,525) on days when no wildlife incident reports were filed than days when wildlife incident reports were filed (n = 521) and camera traps recorded no images. Z-test for proportions analyses indicated that birds (ie flocks) were more commonly observed and reported by airport personnel than were captured by camera traps, while mammals such as moose (Alces alces), black bears (Ursus americanus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were more commonly recorded by camera traps. These findings suggest that data from camera traps can help in the development of more informed AWMPs.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;PG&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>IngentaConnect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2017/00000011/00000004/art00007</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sano, H</author><author>Rui, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Facies interpretation of Middle Carboniferous to Lower Permian Pope succession limestone of Cache Creek Group, Fort St. James, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>535-550</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>ROCKS</keyword><keyword>TERRANE</keyword><keyword>JAPAN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e01-009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lithostratigraphy and microfacies of the Bashkirian to Asselian Pope succession limestone of the Cache Creek Group near Fort St. James, central British Columbia, were lithologically grouped into five facies associations A to E. On the basis of fusulines and conodonts, facies associations A to D and the lower part of facies association E are time-equivalent, ranging from the lower Bashkirian to lower Kasimovian, and the upper part of facies association E is dated as upper Gzhelian to Asselian. The Pope succession limestone is interpreted to have been built on a basaltic basement of an oceanic plateau or seamount in an open-ocean realm. The limestone is devoid of terrigenous grains, is associated with basaltic rocks, and laterally grades into deeper-water spicular cherts. Microfacies analysis of facies associations A to E showed that they exhibit characteristic facies of (A) deep-water basinal setting, (B) marginal basin to lower slope, (C) shallow-subtidal bank margin, (D) peritidal algal mound on the bank margin, and (E) shallow-subtidal bank margin to intertidal lagoonal flat,. Moscovian to Asselian rocks of facies associations C, D, and E record an upward increase of low-relief encrusting calci-microbes as rock-builders. This tendency is closely correlated with that in limestone buildups mapped from the Panthalassan Ocean. The abundance of phylloid algal plates and the reefal facies of the Moscovian rocks of facies association D are the same as the reef-building phylloid algae of the Bashkirian to Sakmarian limestone of both the Tethyan and Panthalassan oceans. The Pope succession limestone has many similarities in tectonic, stratigraphic, sedimentologic, and paleontologic aspects to the Akiyoshi buildup, a representative Panthalassan buildup in a Permian subduction-related accretionary complex in Japan. The timing of the increasing importance of the calci-microbes and phylloid algae in the Pope and Akiyoshi buildups is also correlatable.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;39</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sano, H</author><author>Orchard, MJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Necoslie breccia: mixed conodont fauna-bearing neptunian dyke in Carboniferous-Permian seamount-capping oceanic buildup (Pope succession, Cache Creek Complex, central British Columbia)</title><secondary-title>FACIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FACIES</full-title></periodical><pages>133-145</pages><volume>50</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>TERRANE</keyword><keyword>Cache Creek Complex</keyword><keyword>GENESIS</keyword><keyword>mid-oceanic buildup</keyword><keyword>mixed conodont fauna</keyword><keyword>MIXING-ZONE</keyword><keyword>Necoslie breccia</keyword><keyword>neptunian dyke</keyword><keyword>SPAIN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0172-9179</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10347-004-0002-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A mixed conodont fauna-bearing limestone breccia, informally designated as Necoslie breccia, crops out as an internal sediment hosted by the Lower Moscovian limestone unit of the Pope limestone succession (Bashkirian to Asselian) of Cache Creek Complex in central British Columbia, reconstructed as a mid-oceanic buildup upon a seamount, or an oceanic plateau. Necoslie breccia consists predominantly of limestone fragments derived from the host rocks, with subordinate isolated skeletal debris, all embedded in a matrix of fine-grained clastic carbonates. The mixed conodont fauna yields the youngest element indicative of Carnian. Our microscopic examination and conodont paleontological data show that Necoslie breccia is better defined as a neptunian dyke formed by infilling sedimentation of carbonates in a fracturing-generated submarine cavity, rather than a karstic cave-fill deposit. We postulate that infilling sedimentation took place immediately after the formation of the cavity, most likely in a transgression period during Carnian time.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sanderson, D</author><author>Picketts, IM</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Fell, B</author><author>Baker, S</author><author>Lee-Johnson, E</author><author>Auger, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change and water at Stellat'en First Nation, British Columbia, Canada: Insights from western science and traditional knowledge</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>136-150</pages><volume>59</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>RESILIENCE</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>TRENDS</keyword><keyword>ICE</keyword><keyword>JAMES</keyword><keyword>Stellat'en First Nation</keyword><keyword>traditional knowledge</keyword><keyword>water</keyword><keyword>western science</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12142</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Insights from both western science and traditional knowledge were applied to identify, and begin to address, climate change and water impacts at Stellat'en First Nation, British Columbia, Canada. Qualitative data from interviews and surveys of Stellat'en community members were compiled and compared with air temperature, precipitation, and hydrometric data from meteorological stations and proximal rivers. Community Elders noted changes to river water levels and shifts in fish populations. The quantitative data revealed a 2.3 degrees C rise in air temperature, 5 percent increase in precipitation, and 10 percent decline in snowfall over a 40-year period. Results from these analyses were reported in two knowledge intersection workshops at Stellat'en First Nation, and information sharing took place to: facilitate discussion and awareness between traditional and western knowledge holders, gain insights on the community's views of climate change and water, and identify strategies for action.

This article aimed to study the incarcerated homeless and identify specific vulnerabilities, which rendered them different from the nonincarcerated homeless. It also aimed to describe the homeless population and its significant involvement with the criminal justice and enforcement system. Methods: Data were derived from the British Columbia Health of the Homeless Study (BCHOHS), carried out in three cities in British Columbia, Canada: the large urban center Vancouver (n = 250), Victoria (n = 150) and Prince George (n = 100). Measures included socio-demographic information, the Maudsley Addiction Profile (MAP), the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) Plus. Results: Incarcerated homeless were more often male (66.6%), were in foster care (56.4%) and had greater substance use especially of crack cocaine (69.6%) and crystal methamphetamine (78.7%). They also had greater scores on emotional and sexual abuse domains of CTQ, indicating greater abuse. A higher prevalence of depression (57%) and psychotic disorders (55.3%) was also observed. Risk factors identified which had a positive predictor value were male gender (p &lt; .001; odds ratio (OR) = 2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7-4.4), a diagnosis of depression (p = .02; 95% CI: 1.1-4.4) and severe emotional neglect (p = .02; 95% CI: 1.1-3.2) in the childhood. Conclusion: Homeless individuals may be traumatized at an early age, put into foster care, rendered homeless, initiated into substance use and re-traumatized on repeated occasions in adult life, rendering them vulnerable to incarceration and mental illness.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryser, L</author><author>Halseth, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Institutional barriers to incorporating climate responsive design in commercial redevelopment</title><secondary-title>ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING &amp; DESIGN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENVIRONMENT AND PLANNING B-PLANNING &amp; DESIGN</full-title></periodical><pages>34-55</pages><volume>35</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>POLICY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0265-8135</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1068/b32066</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For decades the literature on the winter cities and on urban design has explored the implications of poorly designed urban spaces on pedestrian mobility during various seasons. In Canada, however, practice in using climate responsive design principles tends to be the exception. Using a case study methodology, this paper explores the application of climate responsive design principles in the commercial redevelopment process in Prince George, British Columbia. Findings indicate that, despite expressed interest in winter city development, professionals and decision makers involved in the development permit process do not possess sufficient knowledge about climate responsive design to apply these principles to everyday practice. More importantly, knowledge about climate responsive design did not appear to be a major consideration in creating or evaluating commercial redevelopment projects. A range of educational, attitudinal, regulatory, structural, and political barriers impede the development of an institutional framework to support the implementation of climate responsive design.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;59</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryder, JM</author><author>Maynard, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cordilleran Ice-Sheet in Northern British-Columbia</title><secondary-title>GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOGRAPHIE PHYSIQUE ET QUATERNAIRE</full-title></periodical><pages>355-363</pages><volume>45</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0705-7199</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.7202/032881ar</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dates from lavas associated with tills and erratics indicate that ice-sheet glaciations occurred between 4 and 0.6 Ma BP. The few radiocarbon dates that are available suggest that the chronology of the Late Wisconsinan (Fraser Glaciation) ice sheet of northern British Columbia was similar to that of the southern part of the province. During what may have been a long, early phase of this glaciation, Glacial Lake Stikine was dammed by advancing valley glaciers in the Coast Mountains, and alpine glaciers developed on the intermontane plateau. At the climax of Fraser Glaciation, ice-flow patterns were dominated by outflow from a neve centred over the northern Skeena Mountains. Deglaciation occurred partly by frontal retreat of ice tongues and partly by downwasting of stagnant ice. Recessional moraines mark one or more resurgences or stillstands of the ice margin. During deglaciation, Stikine River valley was occupied by an active outlet glacier and a major subglacial drainage system.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rouse, GE</author><author>Mathews, WH</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Palynology and Geochronology of Eocene beds from Cheslatta-Falls and Nazko areas, Central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1268-1276</pages><volume>25</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e88-122</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ross, JV</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Internal Fabric of an alpine Peridotite near Pinchi Lake, Central British Columbia.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>32-44</pages><volume>14</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1977</year><pub-dates><date>1977</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e77-004</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ross, JV</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Internal structure of Murray Ridge Ultramafic, Central, BC, Canada</title><secondary-title>TRANSACTIONS-AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TRANSACTIONS-AMERICAN GEOPHYSICAL UNION</full-title></periodical><pages>435-435</pages><volume>55</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1974</year><pub-dates><date>1974</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-8606</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rondeau-Genesse, G</author><author>Trudel, M</author><author>Leconte, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring snow wetness in an Alpine Basin using combined C-band SAR and MODIS data</title><secondary-title>REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>304-317</pages><volume>183</volume><keywords><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>AREA</keyword><keyword>ACCURACY</keyword><keyword>Alpine river basin</keyword><keyword>ASSIMILATION</keyword><keyword>COVER PRODUCTS</keyword><keyword>Crocus</keyword><keyword>MODIS</keyword><keyword>RADARSAT</keyword><keyword>RADARSAT-2</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing</keyword><keyword>SENTINEL-1</keyword><keyword>Snowmelt</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW</keyword><keyword>SURFEX</keyword><keyword>Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)</keyword><keyword>VALIDATION</keyword><keyword>WET SNOW</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-4257,1879-0704</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2016.06.003</electronic-resource-num><abstract>MODIS is a reliable means of monitoring the snow cover extent over an entire river basin. However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

This moth causes considerable problems in lodgepole pine seed orchards at this location. No significant differences in trap catches were found between wing traps and Unitraps in two experiments. There were no significant differences between catches in Unitraps baited with 50, 100, or 200 mug of the pheromone loaded on red rubber septa. In a second experiment, Unitraps baited with four rubber septa, each loaded with 200 jig fora total load of 800 mug, captured significantly more Doughts-fir pitch moths than those baited with one septum (200 mug) or two septa (400 mug) of the pheromone.

However, the current beetle epidemic in this area highlights the challenges faced by forest managers tasked with prioritizing stands for mitigation activities such as salvage harvesting and direct control methods. In western Canada, the operational risk rating system for mountain pine beetle is based on biological knowledge gained from a rich legacy of stand-scale field studies. Due to the large spatial (millions of hectares affected) and temporal (over 10 years) extents of the current epidemic, new research into large-area mountain pine beetle processes has revealed further insights into the landscape-scale characteristics of beetle infested forests. in this paper, we evaluated the potential for this new knowledge to augment an established system for rating the short-term risk of tree mortality in a stand due to mountain pine beetle. New variables explored for utility in risk rating include direct shortwave radiation, site index, diameter at breast height, the temporal trends in local beetle populations, Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification and beetle-host interaction variables. Proportional odds ordinal regression was used to develop a model for the Vanderhoof Forest District in west-central British Columbia.

The sample consisted of 838 (402 male, 436 female) randomly selected residents of Prince George, British Columbia. An exploratory factor analysis was conducted using the measures of physical, psychological and social health included in the NPHS. The HUI-Mark III scores were then regressed on to the factors in an attempt to determine the proportion of variance in factor scores accounted for by the HUI-Mark III.

Continuous centerline acoustic Doppler current profiler survey and observations of bedrock confinement, supplemented with measurements on air photos, reveal the influence of bedrock on channel properties. The surveyed reach was subdivided into 10 morphological reaches, ranging from dominance by alluvial gravel-bed channels to dominantly rock-walled canyons. Measured data were grouped within each reach based on the presence of bedrock on both banks, one bank, or neither bank. From alluvial to mixed to canyon-dominated reaches, river widths decreased while water depths, flow velocities, water surface slopes, and bed shear stresses increased. Within reaches, subreaches with bedrock on both banks were narrower and deeper with higher bed shear stresses but, at the observed stage, had lower depth-averaged velocity and water surface slope than partly confined and alluvial (unconfined) subreaches. A conceptual model is presented representing a bedrock river as an alternating series of relatively low gradient, deep, rock-walled pools and steep semialluvial or alluvial sections. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations have scaling exponents expected for alluvial channels provided that the alluvial and rock-influenced sections are analyzed separately. In Fraser River, canyons become relatively narrower downstream, apparently in response to increasing rock uplift during the Quaternary period. The observations are compared against prior semitheoretical frameworks established to explain variations in width, slope, and channel shape along rockbound channels. Plain Language Summary Using data derived from a 524-km traverse of the canyon-infested Fraser River, British Columbia, we learned that the rock-walled canyons, which occupy only 16% of the total distance, are steeper and narrower than the rest of the river but, surprisingly, have lower water velocity and lower slope. So how do the canyons manage to transport all the sediment fed into them and remain rockbound? They maintain higher sediment mobilizing forces on the bed because the maximum flow velocity plunges to near the bed as the flow is squeezed into the narrow canyon. Despite this effect, the canyons maintain the overall scaling relations for width, depth, and flow expected in rivers that are not rockbound. We also detected an effect of recent rock uplift whereby the reaches subject to greater uplift are relatively narrower as the river focuses all erosive energy on downcutting to maintain its course over the uplifted reach.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reed, MG</author><author>McIlveen, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toward a pluralistic civic science?: Assessing community forestry</title><secondary-title>SOCIETY &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIETY &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</full-title></periodical><pages>591-607</pages><volume>19</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>community</keyword><keyword>SUSTAINABILITY</keyword><keyword>ECOLOGY</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENT</keyword><keyword>community-based environmental management</keyword><keyword>feminist scholarship</keyword><keyword>pluralistic civic science</keyword><keyword>ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>forestry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0894-1920,1521-0723</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08941920600742344</electronic-resource-num><abstract>While stakeholder involvement in environmental management is now common, we suggest that stakeholders can contribute to a pluralistic civic science that incorporates local knowledge directly into environmental decision making and research. We consider how insights from feminist scholarship might help us to understand the influence of power relations among our subjects of study and in determining how scientific knowledge is defined and used. We pay particular attention to how knowledge is produced, how participation is constrained, and to what extent community participants and researchers would benefit from critical reflection in their work. We apply these elements to an assessment of a community forestry pilot project in Burns Lake, British Columbia, Canada.

To determine how vegetation management in transportation (road and rail) corridors at different times of the year could influence browse quality in the years following cutting, and how this could potentially influence encounters between herbivores and vehicles, we undertook a 3-year study. In 2001, at a wildlife viewing area near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, we established a control area and treatment areas where shrubs and trees that are used as food by moose (Alces alces) were cut at the beginning of June, July, August, September, and October. In the fall, moose were most often observed browsing the resprouts of plants cut in August (years 1 and 2 post-treatment) and September (year 3). Cumulative winter track counts were highest in the uncut control area in the years following cutting. Spring pellet counts revealed that most pellets were deposited in the uncut (years 1 and 2) and August-cut (year 3) areas during winter. With the exception of the first year after cutting, browse removal by moose was highest for plants cut later in the growing season. Overall, our findings suggest that following cutting, plants cut later in the year are selected more often by moose relative to those cut earlier. To reduce browse use of corridor vegetation in areas where concerns for moose-vehicle collisions exist, we recommend that vegetation maintenance activities be conducted in the early summer months of June and July.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ransome, DB</author><author>Lindgren, PMF</author><author>Sullivan, DS</author><author>Sullivan, TP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-term responses of ecosystem components to stand thinning in young lodgepole pine forest. 1.

A key uncertainty is whether those wildlife species associated with these structural characteristics will respond positively to their development in thinned young seral forests. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that population dynamics (abundance, breeding condition, and survival) of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) would be maintained at levels recorded in old-growth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young (17-27 years old) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests. Replicated study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three young pine stands thinned to densities of similar to500 (low), similar to1000 (medium), and similar to2000 (high) stems/ha, with unthinned (4300-7600 stems/ha) and old-growth stands for comparison. Populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus were sampled intensively from 2000 to 2002 corresponding to 12-14 years after thinning. Abundance of G. sabrinus was significantly higher in the high-density stand and lowest in the low-density and unthinned stands. Intermediate densities were found in the medium-density and old-growth stands. Adult male body mass was significantly greater in old-growth than high-density stands. We failed to detect significant differences among treatments for recruitment, movement, and survival for G. sabrinus and all parameters measured for T. hudsonicus. Survival increased significantly in 2002 from previous years for G. sabrinus, while survival decreased significantly for T. hudsonicus during this period. Our results support the hypothesis that population dynamics of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus would be maintained at levels recorded in oldgrowth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young lodgepole pine forests. Abundance of G. sabrinus in highdensity stands exceeded levels recorded in old-growth stands. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Alternatively, geographic song variation may be functionally neutral, emerging as a by-product of idiosyncrasies of founder effects and song learning in peripheral populations. We studied differences in the terminal notes of songs in White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) in a peripheral population found west of the Rocky Mountains. Unlike the common triplet of notes found in terminal strophes of the main distribution of this species in eastern North America, birds in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, had terminal notes composed of doublets. We mapped song variation on an east-west transect through central Alberta, Canada, but were unable to find a sharp division between areas where the terminal notes shift; instead, we found evidence of a cline of increasing frequency of doublet endings from east to west. We performed playback experiments of local versus foreign song types in populations where doublet terminal strophes (Prince George, BC) versus triplet terminal strophes (Algonquin Park, ON) predominate. We found a significant difference between the populations, with the western birds responding more strongly overall than the eastern birds, and males in both populations responding more strongly to the doublet-ending song type. Our results do not support the origination of regional variation to discriminate among local populations, but are consistent with neutral cultural shifts.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raibmon, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>When the plumes rise: The way of the Lake Babine nation</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>764-766</pages><volume>82</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3755</isbn><abstract>This book, the first to be written about the Lake Babine Nation in north-central British Columbia, examines its traditional legal order, self-identity, and their involvement in current treaty negotiations.Changing relations between the First Nations and the Canadian state have led to a new awareness of customary legal orders.

We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to &gt;20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (&gt;50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

The early dates and the fact that these features have survived at all have significant implications for interpretations of the development of the ethnographically described salmon focused cultures of this area, and the network of relationships they developed to compensate for cycles in sockeye abundance.

The scars left on living pine trees (Culturally Modified Trees, or CMTs) by cambium stripping are directly datable evidence for this subsistence activity by utilizing forestry increment borers to extract cores. Further, pine cambium is generally regarded as a marginal, or supplementary resource, with changes in the frequency of cambium collection being related to natural cycles in the abundance of staple resources. This paper discusses the dating of these subsistence features, and in comparing two areas of the Nechako River drainage of British Columbia, suggests that pine cambium was more intensively utilized in areas lacking salmon, the staple of the greater region.

Five biomonitoring periods, of 7 days duration, were selected to cover a full range of seasonal river conditions. Leeches bioconcentrated tri- and tetrachlorinated phenolics (bioconcentration factors: 465-6000) in proportions similar to those present in both mill effluent and river water. Leeches showed 3,4,5-trichloroguaiacol (3,4,5-TCG) to be the most consistent tracer of bleached kraft mill discharge. Leeches provided direct evidence that increasing ClO2 substitution reduces amounts of chlorinated phenolics accumulated by aquatic organisms, with sharp decreases observed at ClO2 levels greater than 90%. This study suggests that leeches could be applied as routine biomonitors for environmental impact monitoring.

The forest-management practices necessary to conserve caribou differ substantially between these two categories of animals with different life-history strategies. Because of this variability in winter-habitat use, information relating specifically to Takla Lake caribou was required for forest management. To provide this information, we radio-collared 15 female caribou in two subherds in the vicinity of Takla Lake and determined their distribution and movements between January 1996 and May 1998 in relation to topography and vegetation cover. Habitat selection was examined using a classified satellite image. At the landscape scale, Takla Lake caribou avoided low-elevation forests (presumably because of the associated high risk of predation from wolves (Canis lupus)), occupying small seasonally overlapping home ranges (mean 151 km(2)) at intermediate and high elevations. Within home ranges in all seasons, caribou were most often found in the forest but, relative to availability, they selected forests only during calving. When in the forest, caribou selected open hybrid white-Engelmann spruce (Picea glauca x Picea engelmannii) - subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forests over lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and deciduous forests in all seasons except spring. Caribou selected open spruce-fir stands over dry and closed spruce-fir stands in all seasons except calving. We conclude that caribou feed primarily on arboreal lichens in winter, because the open spruce-fir forests that they use have moderate to high arboreal lichen abundance, deep snow, and few terrestrial lichens. Takla Lake caribou were not typical of either mountain or northern caribou, but as is typical of insular populations of any species, have adapted to the food, topography, and cover types available to them on their mountain islands in a sea of moose (Alces alces) and wolves.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plouffe, A</author><author>Rasmussen, PE</author><author>Hall, GEM</author><author>Pelchat, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mercury and antimony in soils and non-vascular plants near two past-producing mercury mines, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOCHEMISTRY-EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT ANALYSIS</full-title></periodical><pages>353-364</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>MINERALIZATION</keyword><keyword>mercury</keyword><keyword>TILL</keyword><keyword>GEOCHEMISTRY</keyword><keyword>ATMOSPHERIC DEPOSITION</keyword><keyword>BASE-METAL SMELTER</keyword><keyword>CONTAMINATION</keyword><keyword>FLIN FLON</keyword><keyword>humus</keyword><keyword>KOLA-PENINSULA</keyword><keyword>non-vascular plants</keyword><keyword>PROVISIONAL ELEMENTAL VALUES</keyword><keyword>sequential leaching</keyword><keyword>soil</keyword><keyword>TRACE-ELEMENTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1467-7873</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1144/1467-7873/03-049</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mercury and Sb in soils (humus, B horizon, C horizon) and environmental biomonitors (moss and epiphytic lichen) were examined near two past-producing Hg, mines located in British Columbia, Canada: Pinchi Lake and Bralorne Takla mines. Sequential extraction analyses and scanning electron microscopy were used to determine the chemical associations of Hg and Sb and the mineralogical forms of Hg in soils. Mercury and Sb in the C horizon are derived mostly from natural sources because their concentrations are controlled by the bedrock geology, glacial transport, and sediment types. Distribution of Sb in the B horizon is similar to that of the C horizon suggesting, a common geogenic source. Mercury in the B horizon at Pinchi Lake mine could be derived in part from anthropogenic sources,. because (1) only at that site, and not at any other sites of cinnabar occurrences in bedrock, is there a labile Hg enrichment in the B compared to the C horizon, and (2) there is a weak correlation between non-labile Hg concentrations in the B horizon and distance from the mine which occurs independently of the natural concentrations of the C horizon. Mercury and Sb concentrations in humus near Pinchi Lake mine (&lt;10 km) appear to be derived in part from anthropogenic sources because there are strong correlations between labile and non-labile He, and Sb concentrations with distance from the mine which occurs independently of natural concentrations in the C horizon. Near Pinchi Lake mine, biogeochemical cycling and gaseous Hg derived from the substrate are thought to be minimal pathways and sources of Hg to the humus compared to anthropogenic sources, otherwise the strong Ha enrichment in the humus compared to the C horizon only observed near Pinchi Lake mine would also be present at several sites of cinnabar occurrences in bedrock along Pinchi Fault. Anthropogenic Ho, and Sb enrichment in the soils near Bralorne Takla mine is indistinguishable from natural enrichment. Mercury and Sb levels In the sampled moss and lichen species reflect locally derived wind-borne sod and rock dust.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plouffe, A</author><author>Levson, VM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late Quaternary glacial and interglacial environments of the Nechako River - Cheslatta Lake area, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>719-731</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>HISTORY</keyword><keyword>CORDILLERAN ICE-SHEET</keyword><keyword>ADVANCE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-111</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Quaternary stratigraphy of the Nechako River - Cheslatta Lake area of central British Columbia is described and interpreted to reconstruct the late Quaternary history of the region. Exposures of glacial and nonglacial sediments deposited prior to the last glaciation (Fraser) are limited to three sites. Pollen assemblages from pre-Fraser nonglacial sediments at two of these sites reveal forested conditions around 39 000 BP. During the advance phase of the Fraser Glaciation, glacial lakes were ponded when trunk glaciers blocked some tributary valleys. Early in the glaciation, the drainage was free in easterly draining valleys. Subsequently, the easterly drainage was blocked either locally by sediments and ice or as a result of impoundment of the Fraser River and its tributaries east of the study area. Ice generally moved east and northeast from accumulation zones in the Coast Mountains. Ice flow was influenced by topography. Major late-glacial lakes developed in the Nechako River valley and the Knewstubb Lake region because potential drainage routes were blocked by ice.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;43</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plouffe, A</author><author>Jette, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Middle Wisconsinan sediments and paleoecology of central British Columbia: sites at Necoslie and Nautley rivers</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>200-208</pages><volume>34</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>POLLEN</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>HISTORY</keyword><keyword>STRATIGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>LATE-QUATERNARY VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>PALYNOLOGY</keyword><keyword>YUKON</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e17-016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>At two sites in central British Columbia, sediments with dispersed organic matter, underneath Fraser Glaciation deposits, are interpreted as nonglacial deposits of Middle Wisconsinan age (Olympia Nonglacial Interval). At Necoslie River, undated sand with dispersed organic matter, thought to be fluvial in origin, is overlain by Fraser drift. At Nautley River, similar sand contains plant detritus that has yielded C-14 ages of 38 230 +/- 410 BP (Beta-88557) and 42460 +/- 670 BP (Beta-88558). Pollen assemblages of the sediments with dispersed organic matter at the Necoslie River and Nautley River sites are similar: both assemblages are dominated by herb pollen, with a lesser amount of tree pollen. The pollen assemblages are thought to reflect a tundra-type vegetation. Because vegetation in the area is presently dominated by spruce and subalpine fir forest, climate during deposition probably was much cooler than today. Data presented here support the contention of other studies in western Canada that cooler climatic conditions existed for some time during the Middle Wisconsinan.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plouffe, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glacial dispersal of mercury from bedrock mineralization along Pinchi Fault North Central British-Columbia</title><secondary-title>WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION</full-title></periodical><pages>1109-1112</pages><volume>80</volume><number>1-4</number><issue>1-4</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0049-6979</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01189772</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mineralized occurrences of Hg in bedrock are abundant along Pinchi Fault, in north central British Columbia, two of which have been mined in the early to mid 20th century.

Two formerly producing mercury mines have been developed on this fault: Pinchi and Bralorne Takla. The mercury content of till (a sediment type directly deposited by glaciers) in the area of this fault is primarily controlled by the occurrence of cinnabar mineralization in bedrock and the direction of ice flow. Cinnabar-bearing bedrock was eroded by glaciers, transported in the direction of ice flow, and deposited "down-ice" from its source. An example of such a dispersal train is documented for the Pinchi Mine area where mercury ore was transported over a distance of 12 km, as measured in the clay-sized fraction (&lt; 0.002 mm) of till, and could have been transported over 24 km according to heavy mineral concentrates (specific gravity &gt; 3.3) of this same sediment. Antimony, chromium, and nickel dispersal trains were also detected in the region. These data indicate that natural glacial processes can result in the "mobilization" of metals in the surficial environment, a factor which has to be considered at mine sites in glaciated terrain, where mine reclamation and remediation measures are now required.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;80</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pinder, KE</author><author>Ford, JC</author><author>Ovalle, WK</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A New Paradigm for Teaching Histology Laboratories in Canada's First Distributed Medical School</title><secondary-title>ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION</full-title></periodical><pages>95-101</pages><volume>1</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>distributed anatomical sciences</keyword><keyword>educational methodology</keyword><keyword>histology</keyword><keyword>medical education</keyword><keyword>undergraduate medical education</keyword><keyword>virtual microscopy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1935-9772</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ase.22</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To address the critical problem of inadequate physician supply in rural British Columbia, The University of British Columbia (UBC) launched an innovative, expanded and distributed medical program in 2004-2005. Medical students engage in a common curriculum at three geographically distinct sites across B.C.: in Vancouver, Prince George and Victoria. The distribution of the core Histology course required a thorough revision of our instructional methodology. We here report our progress and address the question "How does one successfully distribute Histology teaching to remote sites while maintaining the highest of educational standards?'' The experience at UBC points to three specific challenges in developing a distributed Histology curriculum: (i) ensuring equitable student access to high quality histological images, (ii) designing and implementing a reliable, state-of-the-art technological infrastructure that allows for real-time teaching and interactivity across geographically separate sites and (iii) ensuring continued student access to faculty content expertise. High quality images-available through any internet connection-are provided within a new virtual slide box library of 300 light microscopic and 190 electron microscopic images. Our technological needs are met through a robust and reliable videoconference system that allows for live, simultaneous communication of audio/visual materials across the three sites. This system also ensures student access to faculty content expertise during all didactic teaching sessions. Student examination results and surveys demonstrate that the distribution of our Histology curriculum has been successful. Anat Sci Ed 1:95-101, 2008.

As part of ongoing research on adaptation in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada we hosted a workshop with City staff and community stakeholders to build local capacity and initiate an adaptation strategy. Past climate trends and future scenarios were used to gain a better understanding of the changes occurring and expected in the region. The highest priorities identified for Prince George relate to forest fires, flooding, emergency response to extreme events, water supply and transportation infrastructure.

In partnership with a watershed alliance we endeavoured to understand the interplay of climate change and resource exploitation impacts in the Nechako River Basin, which drains an area of 52,000km(2) in northwestern Canada as part of the Fraser River Basin. Existing regional climatic studies show a clear warming trend over the last century and a projected mean temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C for the 2050s. Watershed stakeholders determined that hydroelectric development and forestry activities interrelate particularly closely with climate impacts related to ecosystem function, water supply, and (resultantly) community well-being. Mining and oil and gas development do not currently represent a high level of concern, but will become problematic with future resource exploitation or climatic changes. The process was effective in grounding specific, day-to-day realities of climate change. The results illustrate the importance and challenge of considering both impact sources in tandem, and should inform ongoing regional planning and monitoring efforts. A major barrier to performing this type of assessment with regional stakeholders is communicating, cross-referencing, and visualizing the interrelationships between climate change and resource development, which are independently highly complex.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;66</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picketts, IM</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Parkes, MW</author><author>Sharma, AR</author><author>Matthews, CA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scenarios of climate change and natural resource development: Complexity and uncertainty in the Nechako Watershed</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>475-488</pages><volume>64</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>MODELS</keyword><keyword>TRENDS</keyword><keyword>RIVER-BASIN</keyword><keyword>resource development</keyword><keyword>Nechako Watershed</keyword><keyword>scenarios</keyword><keyword>stakeholder engagement</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12609</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change and resource development interact to have significant impacts on both natural and human systems within watersheds. It is, however, difficult to conceptualize and communicate these intersections, as climate change and resource development are each independently uncertain and complex. We facilitated a process whereby stakeholders created plausible future scenarios for the Nechako Watershed in British Columbia, Canada. This region is reliant upon, and has been significantly affected by, many types of resource exploitation. During a full-day workshop, 32 stakeholders created scenarios for 2050 envisioning high and low levels of both resource development and climate change. The high and low levels of climate change were based on downscaled projections from global emissions scenarios, and the resource development levels were determined at the beginning of the workshop by the participants. The exercise was educational, and motivated stakeholders to conceptualize plausible future changes and their impacts, and the outcomes should motivate stakeholders to work towards realizing a more desired future. All scenarios (even low-low) were deemed to have significant negative impacts, suggesting that the Nechako Watershed is in a vulnerable state. The complexity of the exercise suggests that more capacity building may be necessary.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandercock, Leonie</author><author>Attili, Giovanni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Unsettling a settler society</title><secondary-title>Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Real Social Science: Applied Phronesis</full-title></periodical><pages>137-166</pages><edition>Flyvbjerg B, Landman T, Schram S</edition><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Cambridge University Press</publisher><abstract>Prologue Five years ago we heard three anecdotes about the small town of Burns Lake in northern British Columbia that whetted our phronetic research appetite, as well as our evolving interest in film as a mode of inquiry and a way of approaching collaborative and transformational planning. This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006.</abstract><remote-database-name>sapienza.pure.elsevier.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://sapienza.pure.elsevier.com/it/publications/unsettling-a-settler-society-film-phronesis-and-collaborative-pla</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-27 19:24:18</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atleo, C</author><author>Boron, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Land Is Life: Indigenous Relationships to Territory and Navigating Settler Colonial Property Regimes in Canada</title><secondary-title>LAND</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>LAND</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>settler colonialism</keyword><keyword>Indigenous lands</keyword><keyword>private property</keyword><keyword>self-determination</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2073-445X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/land11050609</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Respectful and reciprocal relationships with land are at the heart of many Indigenous cultures and societies. Land is also at the core of settler colonialism. Indigenous peoples have not only been dispossessed of land for settler occupation and resource extraction, but the transformation of land into property has created myriad challenges to ongoing struggles of land repatriation and renewal. We introduce several perspectives on land rooted in diverse Indigenous worldviews and contrast them with settler colonial perspectives rooted in Eurocentric worldviews. We then examine several examples in Canada where Indigenous nations attempt to reconnect with their homelands, protect them, and/or engage with them for economic development. We look at land relationships rooted in historical treaties, contemporary comprehensive claims/self-government agreements, the Indian Act, and the defence of unceded territories. The Indigenous communities we look at include the Six Nations of the Grand River, the Nisga'a Lisims Government, the Westbank First Nation, and the Wet'suwet'en. We contend that a complex configuration of settler colonial institutions challenges long-term efforts for Indigenous land reclamation, protection, and sustainable development, however, Indigenous nations remain steadfast in asserting their self-determination in diverse relational ways inside and outside of settler state systems.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;53</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Atkinson, GM</author><author>Beresnev, IA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Compatible ground-motion time histories for new national seismic hazard maps</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING</full-title></periodical><pages>305-318</pages><volume>25</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>compatible time-histories</keyword><keyword>EASTERN NORTH-AMERICA</keyword><keyword>GREAT EARTHQUAKES</keyword><keyword>ground motions</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC-NORTHWEST</keyword><keyword>PARAMETERS</keyword><keyword>RATIO</keyword><keyword>seismic hazard</keyword><keyword>ZONE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0315-1468</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjce-25-2-305</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ground-motion time histories which are compatible with the uniform hazard spectra (UHS) provided by the new national seismic hazard maps of the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC) are simulated. Time histories are simulated for the following cities: Halifax, La Malbaie, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Prince George, Tofino, Vancouver, and Victoria. The target UHS for the time history simulations are the GSC 5% damped horizontal-component spectra for "firm ground" (Class B) sites for an annual probability of 1/500. The Canadian Council on Earthquake Engineering is currently considering the adoption of these maps as the seismological basis for the earthquake design requirements for future editions of the National Building Code of Canada. It is therefore useful to have compatible time histories for these spectra, in order that dynamic analysis methods requiring the use of time histories can be employed. The simulated records provide a realistic representation of ground motion for the earthquake magnitudes and distances that contribute most strongly to hazard at the selected cities and probability level. For each selected city, two horizontal components are generated for a moderate earthquake nearby, and two horizontal components are generated for a larger earthquake farther away. These records match the short- and long-period ends of the target UHS, respectively. These simulations for local and regional crustal earthquakes are based on a point-source stochastic simulation procedure. For cities in British Columbia, records are also simulated for a scenario M8.5 earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone, using a stochastic finite-fault simulation model. Four different rupture scenarios are considered. The ground motions for this scenario event are not associated with a specific probability level, but current information suggests that their probability of occurrence is comparable to that of the 1/500 UHS (the probabilistic analyses performed for the national hazard maps do not explicitly include the Cascadia subduction event). Thus it would be reasonable to conduct engineering analyses for cities in British Columbia using both the simulated crustal-event motions and the simulated Cascadia-event motions for the Cascadia event. The time histories simulated for this study are available free of charge to all interested parties.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anttila, K</author><author>Eliason, EJ</author><author>Kaukinen, KH</author><author>Miller, KM</author><author>Farrell, AP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Facing warm temperatures during migration: cardiac mRNA responses of two adult Oncorhynchus nerka populations to warming and swimming challenges</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF FISH BIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>1439-1456</pages><volume>84</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>RAINBOW-TROUT</keyword><keyword>heat shock protein</keyword><keyword>hsp</keyword><keyword>immune defence</keyword><keyword>microarray</keyword><keyword>temperature tolerance</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>AEROBIC SCOPE</keyword><keyword>CARDIORESPIRATORY PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>GENE-EXPRESSION</keyword><keyword>GILLICHTHYS-MIRABILIS</keyword><keyword>HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS</keyword><keyword>LOWER FRASER-RIVER</keyword><keyword>THERMAL-ACCLIMATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1112,1095-8649</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jfb.12367</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The main findings of the current study were that exposing adult sockeye salmon Onchorhynchus nerka to a warm temperature that they regularly encounter during their river migration induced a heat shock response at an mRNA level, and this response was exacerbated with forced swimming. Similar to the heat shock response, increased immune defence-related responses were also observed after warm temperature treatment and with a swimming challenge in two different populations (Chilko and Nechako), but with some important differences. Microarray analyses revealed that 347 genes were differentially expressed between the cold (12-13 degrees C) and warm (18-19 degrees C) treated fish, with stress response (GO:0006950) and response to fungus (GO:0009620) elevated with warm treatment, while expression for genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0006119) and electron transport chain (GO:0022900) elevated for cold-treated fish. Analysis of single genes with real-time quantitative PCR revealed that temperature had the most significant effect on mRNA expression levels, with swimming and population having secondary influences. Warm temperature treatment for the Chilko population induced expression of heat shock protein (hsp) 90, hsp90 and hsp30 as well as interferon-inducible protein. The Nechako population, which is known to have a narrower thermal tolerance window than the Chilko population, showed even more pronounced stress responses to the warm treatment and there was significant interaction between population and temperature treatment for hsp90 expression. Moreover, significant interactions were noted between temperature treatment and swimming challenge for hsp90 and hsp30, and while swimming challenge alone increased expression of these hsps, the expression levels were significantly elevated in warm-treated fish swum to exhaustion. In conclusion, it seems that adult O. nerka currently encounter conditions that induce several cellular defence mechanisms during their once-in-the-lifetime migration. As river temperatures continue to increase, it remains to be seen whether or not these cellular defences provide sufficient protection for all O. nerka populations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;72</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anonson, June</author><author>Conroy, Stephanie</author><author>Healey-Ogden, Marion</author><author>Palmer, Jessie</author><author>Shawara, Elaine</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Planting the Seeds of Leadership</title><secondary-title>The Canadian Nurse</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian Nurse</full-title></periodical><pages>24-27</pages><volume>101</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>2.a Workers</keyword><keyword>24.a Intersectoral action</keyword><keyword>25.b Community / Social Systems / Equity</keyword><keyword>3.b.ii Health promotion/education</keyword><keyword>7.b Qualitative</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00084581</isbn><abstract>The college of New Caledonia (CNC) in Prince George, British Columbia, believes in creating an environment where students can learn leadership skills from the beginning of their professional education. To that end, students, faculty members and administrators of CNC's health sciences and social services division worked together to engage in a campaign called "Expect a Leader." The intention of this campaign was to strengthen interdisciplinary awareness between programs and to introduce leadership qualities to future healthcare professionals. This article demonstrates how this initiative created change within six health science programs and across an entire division. The authors represent a cross-disciplinary team of health professionals: former CNC students, faculty members and the administrator. This team came together to discuss leadership strategies and activities that occurred within the educational setting and in the community during the Expect a Leader campaign. The authors anticipate that the campaign will foster students' involvement in interdisciplinary leadership activities within practice settings. Readers of this article will learn about the positive effects of promoting interdisciplinary leadership campaigns across healthcare disciplines, and will gain an understanding of reasons for nurturing leadership from the beginning of the students' education.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Prince George&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.proquest.com/docview/232074790/abstract/A7274B81CD334ECFPQ/1</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2023-01-11 04:46:50</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Angen, J.

Abundant geomorphological evidence indicates that the Fraser River reversed its course to southward flow in the recent geological past. Investigation of two volcanic dams at Dog Creek demonstrates northward flow of the Fraser until at least 1.06 Ma, before reversal and erosion of the 270-km-long Fraser Canyon. We propose that the submarine Nitinat Fan off the coast of British Columbia records the reversal and sudden input of coarse continental-derived sediment ca. 0.76 Ma. This study confirms reversal of the Fraser River and places a firm constraint on the maximum age of that reversal. Reversal likely followed stream capture in response to enhanced glaciofluvial erosion and uplift of the Coast Mountains.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Andrews, GDM</author><author>Plouffe, A</author><author>Ferbey, T</author><author>Russell, JK</author><author>Brown, SR</author><author>Anderson, RG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The thickness of Neogene and Quaternary cover across the central Interior Plateau, British Columbia: analysis of water-well drill records and implications for mineral exploration potential</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>973-986</pages><volume>48</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>AREA</keyword><keyword>HISTORY</keyword><keyword>STRATIGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>BASALTS</keyword><keyword>GANG-RANCH</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E10-080</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Analysis of over 10 000 water-well records has been used to produce new depth-to-bedrock maps for areas around five cities on the central Interior Plateau of central British Columbia: 100 Mile House, Prince George, Quesnel, Vanderhoof, and Williams Lake. Hitherto, exploration for mineral and hydrocarbon resources has been hampered by a lack of basic knowledge of the thickness of Neogene and Quaternary lithologies. Interpretation of these new maps provides first-order constraints on the localization of thick drift in pre-Late Wisconsinan bedrock paleovalleys, some of which are now buried. Basalt lavas of the Chilcotin Group are restricted to erosional remnants of previously extensive sheets emplaced onto an older peneplain. Our results confirm that the Neogene and Quaternary cover is primarily controlled by paleotopography and is generally thin and patchy across much of the region. Increased understanding of the three-dimensional distribution of cover produces a corresponding increase in the utility of geological, geochemical, and geophysical exploration techniques, and a reduction in the risk for future mineral exploration activities, especially when combined with more sophisticated data sets.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Just like starting over at Endako</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN MINING JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN MINING JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>46</pages><volume>111</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4492</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anderson, RG</author><author>Resnick, J</author><author>Russell, JK</author><author>Woodsworth, GJ</author><author>Villeneuve, ME</author><author>Grainger, NC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cheslatta Lake suite: Miocene mafic, alkaline magmatism in central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>697-717</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>RIVER</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>GEOLOGY</keyword><keyword>STRATIGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>XENOLITHS</keyword><keyword>GEOCHEMISTRY</keyword><keyword>CHILCOTIN GROUP BASALTS</keyword><keyword>MANTLE</keyword><keyword>PETROGENESIS</keyword><keyword>VOLCANIC COMPLEX</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-121</electronic-resource-num><abstract>New mapping, mineralogical, and geochemical studies help characterize late Tertiary primitive, alkaline, sodic basanite, alkali olivine basalt, transitional basalt, and diabase in the Nechako River, Whitesail Lake, and McLeod Lake map areas of central British Columbia and distinguish the Miocene Cheslatta Lake suite. The suite encompasses scattered erosional remnants of topographically distinct, columnar-jointed, olivine-phyric basalt and diabase volcanic necks, dykes, and associated lava flows north of the Anahim volcanic belt and west of the Pinchi Fault. Volcanic centres at Alasla Mountain and at Cutoff Creek, near Cheslatta Lake, are proposed as type areas. Olivine, plagioclase, and pyroxene phenocrysts, megacrysts, and (or) xenocrysts; common ultramafic xenoliths; and rare but significant plutonic and metamorphic xenoliths are characteristic. Basanite, transitional basalt, and alkali olivine basalt groundmass contain plagioclase, clinopyroxene, Fe-Ti oxides, feldspathoid, olivine, and apatite. The Cheslatta Lake suite is characterized by its alkaline character, olivine-rich (&gt; 10 wt.%) normative mineralogy, and silica-undersaturated nature (&gt;1 wt.% normative nepheline; hypersthene-normative rocks are uncommon). Mg numbers vary between 72-42. Some samples encompass near-primitive mantle melt compositions.

Shy and retiring in life, Rose's venerators believe that her understated devotion was rewarded by a postmortem miracle generally reserved only for God's greatest saints: incorruption. The Catholic hierarchy and Rose's Carrier people, though at odds on much else, are unanimous that the Lejac Indian Residential School unwittingly hosted a saint between its opening in 1922 and Prince's death in 1949, and the two groups seek together to honor her with an annual pilgrimage to her gravesite. But this fragile unanimity exists in dynamic tension with the two groups' divergent interpretations of Prince's holiness, particularly as it pertains to the legacy of residential schools. For some within the Catholic hierarchy, Rose's sanctity provides a powerful justification for the much-critiqued assimilative educational system. For many Carrier, however, Prince is its starkest repudiation. For them, Rose was-and is-the heart of a heartless world, incarnating gentle compassion in a system that, while it trumpeted these Christian virtues, itself was notably lacking in them.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, KJ</author><author>Chen, XM</author><author>Mesak, LR</author><author>Kitts, DD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Antimicrobial Activity of Salmon Extracts Derived from Traditional First Nations Smoke Processing</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF FOOD PROTECTION</full-title></periodical><pages>1878-1882</pages><volume>75</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>GENOME SEQUENCE</keyword><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS</keyword><keyword>LISTERIA-MONOCYTOGENES</keyword><keyword>MEAT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0362-028X,1944-9097</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4315/0362-028X.JFP-12-010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Freshly caught salmon were hot smoked with the traditional smoke processing methods of the Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh First Nations communities, producing both half-smoked and fully smoked food products. To ascertain the nature of antimicrobial effects related to the smoking process, the residue content of 16 polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and total PAHs of smoked products were determined and correlated with smoking process duration. When compared with fully smoked samples, partially smoked fish had significantly less total PAHs and were composed solely of low-molecular-weight components, with phenanthrene, acenaphthylene, and napthlalene, respectively, being the most abundant. In contrast, fully smoked products possessed significantly higher levels of low- and high-molecular-weight PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene. Sequential extractions of water, ethyl acetate, and hexane were performed to identify antimicrobial activity imparted by the traditional smoking process. No activity was observed in water or ethyl acetate extractions, whereas hexane extracts were inhibitory to Staphylococcus aureus, with more inhibition observed in fully smoked samples when compared with partially smoked samples. This study provides evidence that traditional smoke processing methods used by First Nations communities can provide value toward producing food products that have extended shelf lives, and protect against a prevalent common pathogen easily transmitted by humans to processed food through direct contact.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Allen, SD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using perceptual maps to communicate concepts of sustainable forest management - Collaborative research with the Office of the Wet'suwet'en Nation in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</full-title></periodical><pages>381-386</pages><volume>81</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Wet'suwet'en</keyword><keyword>qualitative research</keyword><keyword>INDICATORS</keyword><keyword>social criteria and indicators</keyword><keyword>sustainable forest management</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-7546</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5558/tfc81381-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article discusses collaborative research with the Office of the Wet ' suwet ' en Nation on their traditional territories in north-central British Columbia, Canada, a forest-dependent region where contemporary and traditional forest resources management regimes overlap.

In a retrospective study, defoliation maps of the study area were overlaid onto British Columbia Ministry of Forests cover type maps using a geographic information system. Analysis of the combined data identified forest characteristics associated with increased susceptibility to defoliation by spruce budworm. These were stands where the leading species was white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). or where spruce was associated with aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx. and P. balsamifera L.) in mixed stands. Susceptibility to defoliation also was related to site quality, level of crown closure and stand age. Spruce stands on medium quality sites (site index 15 to 25 m, at reference breast height age 50 years) were more susceptible than stands on both poor- and high-quality sites. When spruce was mixed with aspen, stands on higher quality sites were more susceptible to budworm attack than poor sites. open stands, where crown closure was &lt;50%, were more susceptible to attack by spruce budworm than closed canopy stands. Older stands (120-199 years) were more susceptible to budworm attack than younger stands (40-110 years). In defoliated plots monitored for 6 years, tree mortality and top-kill reached a maximum of 30.4 and 47.2%, respectively. The losses varied with level of defoliation and were reduced by applications of the biological pesticide Bacillus thuringiensis. Crown Copyright &lt;(c)&gt; 2001 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

Above-canopy dispersion is simulated by the HYSPLIT atmospheric dispersion model using back trajectories started from locations identified by clear-air returns from the Prince George BC weather radar station. The dispersion calculations are carried out over the 10 days showing the highest intensity of clear-air returns from the 2005 emergence season. The Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model is used to simulate the meteorological conditions during each of the 10 emergence days. Cumulative clear-air returns throughout each emergence day are used to estimate the distribution of beetle emergence times and atmospheric residence times. Evaluation of the WRF model output is presented using both surface and upper air observations. Evaluation of the HYSPLIT model is performed through a comparison of the vertical distribution of MPB observed in a previous study. A secondary HYSPLIT evaluation is performed using aerial surveys taken during the following summer (2006), which identify the previous years' beetle-infested regions. Beetle flight distances from the time of beetle emergence to the time of peak clear-air returns are calculated for each trajectory, and the distribution of all flight distances is presented. The mean back trajectory distance is 20.2 km with a standard deviation of 13.6 km. These values represent the MPB flight distance during half of the beetle atmospheric residence time, and typical daily wind-assisted dispersion distances would be expected to be roughly double this value. Mean beetle residence time in the atmosphere over the 10 emergence events is found to be 3.2 h.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ainslie, B</author><author>Jackson, PL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The use of an atmospheric dispersion model to determine influence regions in the Prince George, BC airshed from the burning of open wood waste piles</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>2393-2401</pages><volume>90</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Airshed</keyword><keyword>AREA</keyword><keyword>ASSIMILATIVE-CAPACITY</keyword><keyword>CALPUFF</keyword><keyword>COASTLINE</keyword><keyword>Dispersion modeling</keyword><keyword>Influence region</keyword><keyword>INTERNAL BOUNDARY-LAYER</keyword><keyword>POLLUTANTS</keyword><keyword>SYSTEM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0301-4797,1095-8630</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jenvman.2008.11.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A means of determining air emission source regions adversely influencing the city of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada from potential burning of isolated piles of mountain pine beetle-killed lodge pole pine is presented. The analysis uses the CALPUFF atmospheric dispersion model to identify safe burning regions based on atmospheric stability and wind direction. Model results show that the location and extent of influence regions is sensitive to wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric stability and a threshold used to quantify excessive concentrations. A concentration threshold based on the Canada Wide PM2.5 Standard is used to delineate the influence regions while Environment Canada's (EC) daily ventilation index (VI) is used to quantify local atmospheric stability. Results from the analysis, to be used by air quality meteorologists in assessing daily requests for burning permits, are presented as a series of maps delineating acceptable burning locations for sources placed at various distances from the city center and under different ventilation conditions. The results show that no burning should be allowed within 10 km of the city center; under poor ventilation conditions, no burning should be allowed within 20 km of the city center; under good ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed within 10-15 km of the city center; under good to fair ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed beyond 15 km of the city center; and if the wind direction can be reliably forecast, burning can be allowed between 5 and 10 km downwind of the city center under good ventilation conditions.

RAMS precipitation fields are bias corrected using observations from Environment Canada (EC) synoptic and climate stations and BC provincial snow pillow stations. Raw and bias-corrected model output is compared with observations from EC Reference Climate Network stations, BC provincial Ministry of Transportation and Highways stations, BC Hydro stations, snow course data, and glacier mass balance studies. A water balance is also applied to 12 drainage basins located within the modeling domain to test the consistency of both the raw and bias-corrected precipitation fields with observed streamflow. Model output is compared with the Parameter-Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) and bias-corrected NARR. Isotropic spectral power densities are examined to compare the effective spatial resolution of the various precipitation fields. The spatial distribution of the bias-correction field suggests that RAMS underpredicts precipitation on the western edge of Vancouver Island, Canada, and overpredicts along the southern Coast Mountains. The bias correction helps close the water balance budgets in all basins except the Somass on Vancouver Island. The bias correction generally improves the agreement between RAMS and observed snow water equivalent amounts at the glacier and snow course sites, and observed precipitation amounts at the synoptic, climate, and snow pillow stations. The RAMS and NARR isotropic spectral power densities show a loss of variability at approximately 45 and 63 km, while PRISM shows little falloff down to 16 km.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;64</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abbott, George</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Persistance of Colonial Prejudice and Policy in British Columbia’s Indigenous Relations: Did the Spirit of Joseph Trutch Haunt Twentieth-Century Resource Development?</title><secondary-title>BC Studies</secondary-title><short-title>PERSISTENCE OF COLONIAL PREJUDICE AND POLICY IN BRITISH COLUMBIA'S INDIGENOUS RELATIONS</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BC Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>39-64,247</pages><number>194</number><issue>194</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>General Interest Periodicals--Canada</keyword><keyword>Humanities: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Governors</keyword><keyword>Native North Americans</keyword><keyword>Native peoples</keyword><keyword>Native rights</keyword><keyword>Prejudice</keyword><keyword>Public lands</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00052949</isbn><abstract>With its entry into Confederation, British Columbia assumed jurisdiction over public lands ("assumed" may have a double meaning given the Supreme Court's 2014 Tsilhqot'in decision) through section 92 (5) of the Constitution Act, while the federal government undertook responsibility for "Indians and lands reserved for Indians" under section 91 (24). Governmental conduct of Indigenous relations was further guided by Article 13 of the Terms of Union Act, which committed the Dominion to "a policy as liberal as that hitherto pursued" by colonial governments, supported by a concomitant provincial obligation for periodic transfer of public lands to the Dominion in pursuit of that goal.6 Those arrangements quickly brought competing provincial and federal approaches to "the Indian land question" into overt conflict. The Cheslatta and Ingenika bands were both abruptly uprooted from their homes and reserve lands by the Kemano and W.A.C. Bennett dams, respectively.7 Persistence of policy and prejudice during the period was reflected in two core themes: first, that Indigenous interests were subordinate to governmental interests (replacement of reserves lost to flooding was at best an afterthought, a cursory legal obligation to be fulfilled after substantive resource development decisions had been made);8 second, that government knew best what was good for Indigenous people (what the latter needed or wanted was irrelevant or inconsequential). 96 L.E.

These forward simulations are commonly based on "best-fit" parameter estimates of the Ricker stock-recruitment relationship, despite the fact that such estimates are often highly uncertain. To examine if explicitly accounting for parameter uncertainty using Bayesian methods would affect the results of forward simulations, we compared simulations based on best-fit Ricker parameters to simulations where parameter uncertainty was incorporated through a Bayesian formulation with noninformative priors. Forward simulations using fixed harvest rates were conducted using data for two stocks of Fraser River sockeye (O. nerka) salmon. We found that expected values of spawner and recruit projections for the Bayesian simulations were consistently larger than projections for the best-fit case. Increases in the Bayes projections over those of the best-fit case typically ranged from 5 to 15% for the Stellako stock, and 20 to 60% for the Late Stuart stock. However, these differences were largely attributable to low values of the Ricker beta parameter that were included in the Bayesian prior distribution. Results of Bayesian simulations were found to be highly sensitive to changes in the lower bound of the prior on beta. We conclude that the common approach of specifying noninformative priors by extending uniform distributions across a broad range of parameter values can be inappropriate for the Ricker model, and recommend the use of informative priors whenever possible.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>FISHERY STOCK ASSESSMENT MODELS</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Walton, PD</author><author>Bowden, ME</author><author>Kurtz, SL</author><author>Angus, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of a rime-based reading program with Shuswap and Heiltsuk First Nations prereaders</title><secondary-title>READING AND WRITING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>READING AND WRITING</full-title></periodical><pages>229-264</pages><volume>14</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Aboriginal</keyword><keyword>CAUSAL CONNECTION</keyword><keyword>EARLY LITERACY</keyword><keyword>letter</keyword><keyword>LETTER-SOUND KNOWLEDGE</keyword><keyword>ONSET-RIME</keyword><keyword>ORTHOGRAPHIC ANALOGIES</keyword><keyword>phoneme</keyword><keyword>PHONEMIC SEGMENTATION</keyword><keyword>PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS</keyword><keyword>POOR READERS</keyword><keyword>reading</keyword><keyword>rhyming</keyword><keyword>rime-analogy</keyword><keyword>SPELLING SKILLS</keyword><keyword>WORKING-MEMORY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0922-4777</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1011125315377</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The utility of teaching reading using rime-based reading strategies with prereaders was examined. Two experiments are presented that studied the effects of a rime-based reading program with First Nations prereaders; one experiment with Shuswap kindergartners and the other with Heiltsuk Grade 1 children. Rhyming, phoneme identity, letter-sound knowledge, phonological working memory, First Nations language speaking ability, and reading were measured. In the Shuswap group, the reading program increased the abilities that were specifically taught, rhyming, initial phoneme identity, letter-sounds, and word reading by rime-analogy, compared to the control group. Children also developed abilities that were not specifically taught, final phoneme identity and reading by letter recoding, and could use the rime-analogy strategy to read words with unfamiliar rime endings. Phonological working memory remained unchanged. The Heiltsuk children gained in reading compared to a Grade 1 comparison group. Pretest letter-sound knowledge and rhyming were related to later reading but phoneme identity and First Nations language ability were not. Progress in phonological awareness and word reading can be enhanced in prereaders by adding experience with rime-based strategies to the reading program.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;62</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bobrowsky, PT</author><author>Massey, NWD</author><author>Matheson, A</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Moore, D,Hungr, O</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Aggregate resource potential mapping</title></titles><periodical><full-title>EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-5</full-title></periodical><pages>2817-2823</pages><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>90-5410-990-4</isbn><abstract>Aggregate resources play an essential role in the urban development of most countries. Conflict arises where competing land-use options, dwindling resources and growing development needs, attempt to coexist without prior information on the location of local aggregate resources. As a result, the BC Geological Survey Branch has developed a methodology to provide a "first approximation" of aggregate resource potential. This methodology can be readily adapted elsewhere and integrated into future resource management plans. This paper outlines the methodology used in generating 1:50,000 scale Level-III 'aggregate potential maps'. It involves an area of about 4500 km(2) centred on Prince George, BC. Parameters used to evaluate aggregate potential include landform type, gravel/sand, deposit volume, overburden thickness, historical activity, etc. A weighted algorithm was used to determine the rank categories. The final product is a digital database and digital map product which can be used in any GIS environment.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT, PROCEEDINGS, VOLS 1-5</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Reddy, N</author><author>Iosfin, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BC hydro experience using a small STATCOM to address utility voltage problems</title></titles><periodical><full-title>2003 IEEE PES TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE &amp; EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-3, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS: BLAZING TRAILS IN ENERGY DELIVERY AND SERVICES</full-title></periodical><pages>1157-1161</pages><keywords><keyword>D-SMES</keyword><keyword>D-VAR</keyword><keyword>dynamic reactive compensation</keyword><keyword>simulation models</keyword><keyword>STATCOM</keyword><keyword>voltage regulation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0-7803-8110-6</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/TDC.2003.1335113</electronic-resource-num><abstract>FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) devices such as Static Compensators (STATCOMs) have long been used to solve utility voltage problems. Generally these have been on large-scale installations on interconnected systems providing economies of scale benefits for the utilities. Recent developments and availability of smaller capacity, modular STATCOMs have proved to be just as useful for utilities in addressing a wider array of problems-from voltage regulation of weak transmission systems to multiple just-in-time installations to prevent voltage collapse and improve system stability and reliability. BC Hydro, Vancouver Canada, recently installed a small STATCOM, an 8MVA D-VAR(TM) device, in their system at Fort St. James substation to prevent voltage collapse in the 66-kV long radial system and as a means to defer costly transmission reinforcement This paper outlines the system analysis, procurement, installation and performance of the D-VAR at Fort St. James along with modeling and other applications of small STATCOM devices such as D-VAR for transmission and distribution applications.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>2003 IEEE PES TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION CONFERENCE &amp; EXPOSITION, VOLS 1-3, CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS: BLAZING TRAILS IN ENERGY DELIVERY AND SERVICES</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Park, ND</author><author>Thring, RW</author><author>Garton, RP</author><author>Rutherford, MP</author><author>Helle, SS</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increased biogas production in a wastewater treatment plant by anaerobic co-digestion of fruit and vegetable waste and sewer sludge - A full scale study</title><secondary-title>WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>1851-1856</pages><volume>64</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>anaerobic digestion</keyword><keyword>biogas</keyword><keyword>co-digestion</keyword><keyword>CODIGESTION</keyword><keyword>FRACTION</keyword><keyword>fruit and vegetable waste</keyword><keyword>full scale</keyword><keyword>MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTES</keyword><keyword>ORGANIC WASTE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0273-1223</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2166/wst.2011.753</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Anaerobic digestion is a well established technology for the reduction of organic matter and stabilization of wastewater. Biogas, a mixture of methane and carbon dioxide, is produced as a useful by-product of the process. Current solid waste management at the city of Prince George is focused on disposal of waste and not on energy recovery. Co-digestion of fresh fruit and vegetable waste with sewer sludge can improve biogas yield by increasing the load of biodegradable material. A six week full-scale project co-digesting almost 15,000 kg of supermarket waste was completed. Average daily biogas production was found to be significantly higher than in previous years. Digester operation remained stable over the course of the study as indicated by the consistently low volatile acids-to-alkalinity ratio. Undigested organic material was visible in centrifuged sludge suggesting that the waste should have been added to the primary digester to prevent short circuiting and to increase the hydraulic retention time of the freshly added waste.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Price, R</author><author>Davison, D</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Hill, DA,Leckie, DG</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Operational techniques for assessing NSR areas using an airborne multispectral imager (CASI)</title></titles><periodical><full-title>AUTOMATED INTERPRETATION OF HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION DIGITAL IMAGERY FOR FORESTRY, INTERNATIONAL FORUM</full-title></periodical><pages>161-168</pages><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0-662-27659-0</isbn><abstract>Airborne multi-spectral (CASI) imagery has been acquired for approximately 80,000 hectares in the Prince George Forestry Region in B.C. This work has included validation test area at the Inga Lake Experimental Test Site and a more operational test at Big Lake in the Dawson Creek District. The validation work showed that the CASI can reliably detect individual isolated conifers down to about 75 cm height provided there are no significant obscuring effects due to deciduous trees or shrubs. The conifers are detected using spectral signatures, Then a "well-spaced" mask is applied to remove stems that are too close to other stems. The forest cover polygons are imported digitally and stem densities are calculated for each polygon and output as attribute file for each polygon. The stem densities are also calculated locally using a circular kernel of 0.1 ha size. The resultant stem density maps show the high variability of stem densities within most forest cover polygons. Finally, an example of an OAF (Operational Adjustment Factor) calculation is shown. The OAF image is generated by superimposing a disk of 2.7m diameter on each identified well-spaced stem and then calculating the residual gaps.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>AUTOMATED INTERPRETATION OF HIGH SPATIAL RESOLUTION DIGITAL IMAGERY FOR FORESTRY, INTERNATIONAL FORUM</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Plumb, JM</author><author>Moffitt, CM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Re-Estimating Temperature-Dependent Consumption Parameters in Bioenergetics Models for Juvenile Chinook Salmon</title><secondary-title>TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY</full-title></periodical><pages>323-330</pages><volume>144</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA</keyword><keyword>FISHES</keyword><keyword>TROUT</keyword><keyword>BODY-MASS</keyword><keyword>ENERGETICS</keyword><keyword>FOOD-CONSUMPTION</keyword><keyword>LAKE-MICHIGAN</keyword><keyword>METABOLIC-RATE</keyword><keyword>PERCH PERCA-FLAVESCENS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-8487,1548-8659</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00028487.2014.986336</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Researchers have cautioned against the borrowing of consumption and growth parameters from other species and life stages in bioenergetics growth models. In particular, the function that dictates temperature dependence in maximum consumption (C-max) within the Wisconsin bioenergetics model for Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha produces estimates that are lower than those measured in published laboratory feeding trials. We used published and unpublished data from laboratory feeding trials with subyearling Chinook Salmon from three stocks (Snake, Nechako, and Big Qualicum rivers) to estimate and adjust the model parameters for temperature dependence in C-max. The data included growth measures in fish ranging from 1.5 to 7.2 g that were held at temperatures from 14 degrees C to 26 degrees C. Parameters for temperature dependence in C-max were estimated based on relative differences in food consumption, and bootstrapping techniques were then used to estimate the error about the parameters. We found that at temperatures between 17 degrees C and 25 degrees C, the current parameter values did not match the observed data, indicating that C-max should be shifted by about 4 degrees C relative to the current implementation under the bioenergetics model. We conclude that the adjusted parameters for C-max should produce more accurate predictions from the bioenergetics model for subyearling Chinook Salmon.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samardzic-Petrovic, M</author><author>Dragicevic, S</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Gervasi, O,Murgante, B,Misra, S,Gavrilova, ML,Rocha, AMAC,Torre, C,Taniar, D,Apduhan, BO</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Modeling the Propagation of Forest Insect Infestation Using Machine Learning Techniques</title></titles><periodical><full-title>COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2015, PT III</full-title></periodical><pages>646-657</pages><volume>9157</volume><keywords><keyword>SCALE</keyword><keyword>Mountain Pine Beetle</keyword><keyword>PATTERNS</keyword><keyword>MOUNTAIN PINE-BEETLE</keyword><keyword>SUSCEPTIBILITY</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>Decision tree method</keyword><keyword>Geographic information system</keyword><keyword>Insect infestation</keyword><keyword>Machine learning</keyword><keyword>Spatial modeling</keyword><keyword>AGREEMENT</keyword><keyword>BARK BEETLE</keyword><keyword>EXPANSION</keyword><keyword>LANDSAT</keyword><keyword>LODGEPOLE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0302-9743,1611-3349,978-3-319-21470-2,978-3-319-21469-6</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-319-21470-2_47</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Infestations caused by the mountain pine beetle (MPB) can be seen as complex spatio-temporal process with severe ecological impacts on the forest environment. In order to manage and prevent the insect infestation and reduce significant forest loss it is necessary to improve knowledge about the infestation process. The main objective of this research study is to design and implement a model based on decision trees (DT) mashie learning (ML) technique to forecast the spatial propagation of MPB infestation. The study is implemented in the Bulkley-Nechako region of British Columbia, Canada using data sets for the three time points 2004, 2008 and 2012. The results indicate that the derived DT can accurately characterize the relationships between the considered factors and MPB propagation. The developed DT method can be used to estimate future spread patterns of MPB infestations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND ITS APPLICATIONS - ICCSA 2015, PT III</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bordet, E</author><author>Hart, CJR</author><author>McClenaghan, L</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Barra, F,Reich, M,Campos, E,Tornos, F</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Epithermal-style Au-Ag mineralization in Cretaceous to Eocene felsic volcanic complexes, central British Columbia, western Canada</title></titles><periodical><full-title>LET'S TALK ORE DEPOSITS, VOLS I AND II</full-title></periodical><pages>712-714</pages><keywords><keyword>CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>MAGMATISM</keyword><keyword>U-PB</keyword><keyword>extension</keyword><keyword>Eocene</keyword><keyword>epithermal gold</keyword><keyword>Late Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>magmatism</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-956-287-329-1</isbn><abstract>Precious metal mineralization in the Nechako region of central British Columbia, western Canada is represented by two types of epithermal mineralization hosted in Late Cretaceous to Middle Eocene felsic to intermediate flows, tuffs and breccias. The Capoose, Blackwater and Newton deposits contain disseminated sulphide Au-Ag mineralization associated with low temperature, silica-sericite alteration of Late Cretaceous fragmental volcanic rocks. Structural controls are not obvious, but the location of the Newton prospect between two regional dextral faults support regional-scale structural influences on the localization of mineralization. At Blackdome, Clisbako and Wolf, more traditional low-sulfidation Au-Ag epithermal mineralization is hosted in Eocene fragmental felsic volcanic rocks affected by multi-stage veining and brecciation, and appear to be strongly structurally controlled. These two styles of mineralization probably reflect an evolution of metallogenic conditions associated with episodic but widespread continental magmatism in a post-accretionary extensional tectonic setting.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>LET'S TALK ORE DEPOSITS, VOLS I AND II</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pawlowska-Mainville, A</author><author>Pierreroy, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Duni zuz utilnith, 'tanning moose-hide': weaving Dakelh (Indigenous) intangible cultural heritage transmission with academia hide</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTANGIBLE HERITAGE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTANGIBLE HERITAGE</full-title></periodical><pages>90-101</pages><volume>15</volume><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>Indigenous people</keyword><keyword>Dakelh/Carrier</keyword><keyword>decolonising and 'indigenising' academia</keyword><keyword>embodied pedagogy</keyword><keyword>Nak'azdli Whuten and Tl'azt'en Nations</keyword><keyword>tanning moose-hide</keyword><keyword>traditional practices</keyword><keyword>uda' dene khuna</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1975-3586,1975-4019</isbn><abstract>After many years of colonisation and oppressive policies, Indigenous cultures in Canada are reviving elements of their cultural heritage. As such, numerous Indigenous communities are working with higher learning institutions to safeguard elements of their heritage, specifically, knowledge and land-based practices. In this article, we discuss one case study of Dakelh [Indigenous) knowledge-holders that merged the practice of traditional moose-hide tanning with academic components surrounding issues in cultural heritage. With the intention of transmitting information about the field of ICH as well as safeguarding one Dakelh intangible cultural heritage element, we developed an experiential-learning university course that grounded theoretical issues in Indigenous cultural heritage. In discussing our methodology of merging the two ways of learning and teaching, including the benefits and challenges of such a course, the article elaborates how the combination of traditional and academic methodologies in a university setting can help Indigenous communities transmit their intangible cultural heritage to younger generations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Desai, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disrupting Settler-Colonial Capitalism: Indigenous Intifadas and Resurgent Solidarity from Turtle Island to Palestine</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>43-66</pages><volume>50</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>RIVER</keyword><keyword>settler colonialism</keyword><keyword>Indigenous peoples</keyword><keyword>DECOLONIZATION</keyword><keyword>Israel/Palestine</keyword><keyword>racial capitalism</keyword><keyword>resurgence</keyword><keyword>social movements</keyword><keyword>solidarity</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0377-919X,1533-8614</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/0377919X.2021.1909376</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article explores the resurgence of Indigenous/Palestine solidarity during the Wet'suwet'en land sovereignty struggle in Canada that took place around the same time Donald Trump's Middle East "peace plan" was released in early 2020. Historicizing this resurgence within a longer period of anti-colonial resistance, the article attends to the distinct historical, political-economic, and juridical formations that undergird settler colonialism in Canada and Israel/Palestine. It contends with the theoretical limits of the settler-colonial framework, pushing back against narratives of settler success, and shows how anti-colonial resistance accelerated economic crises that led both settler states to enter into "negotiations" with the colonized (reconciliation in one case, and peace talks in the other) as a strategy to maintain capitalist settler control over stolen lands. The analysis also sheds light on a praxis of solidarity that has implications for movement building and joint struggle.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zahir, S</author><author>Chowdhury, R</author><author>Payne, GW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Automated assessment of erythrocyte disorders using artificial neural network</title></titles><periodical><full-title>2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1 AND 2</full-title></periodical><pages>776-+</pages><keywords><keyword>artificial neural network</keyword><keyword>back propagation learning</keyword><keyword>blood analysis</keyword><keyword>image analysis</keyword><keyword>IMAGES</keyword><keyword>momentum</keyword><keyword>PATTERN-RECOGNITION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-0-7803-9753-8</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/ISSPIT.2006.270903</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper, we employ artificial neural network (ANN) together with image analysis techniques to automate the assessment of erythrocyte disorders using blood parameters such as red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin (Hgb) level, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The neural network is trained using 800 blood sample images collected from the Prince George-BC, Hospital. The images are captured using a high-resolution digital camera mounted on a microscope. The red, green, and blue values of each image are fed as the input of the neural network. The Hospital RBC, Hgb values of the samples measured using hydrodynamic focused analyzer (CELL-DYN 3200 System) are provided as the target values during training. Several variations of the back propagation-learning algorithm were applied for training. The trained network is tested against 200 blood samples. The output results are compared with those of Hospital laboratory and found to be near identical, most of which are within 5% margin of error, and are much significantly better than those published. The proposed method is Simple, fast, accurate, and can be a crucial step in automating laboratory reporting.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>2006 IEEE INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON SIGNAL PROCESSING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, VOLS 1 AND 2</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gottesfeld, AS</author><author>Tunnicliffe, J</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Bogen, J,Fergus, T,Walling, D</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Bed load measurements with a passive magnetic induction device</title></titles><periodical><full-title>EROSION AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT MEASUREMENT IN RIVERS: TECHNOLOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES</full-title></periodical><pages>211-221</pages><keywords><keyword>fluvial geomorphology</keyword><keyword>SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>TRANSPORT</keyword><keyword>bed load</keyword><keyword>bed load movement sensors</keyword><keyword>gravel bed streams</keyword><keyword>pool-riffle morphology</keyword><keyword>RECORDING BEDLOAD TRAP</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0144-7815,1-901502-42-2</isbn><abstract>The Bed load Movement Detector (BMD) is installed on the O'Ne-ell Creek, a gravel bed stream, with a forced pool-riffle morphology, in the upper Fraser River basin in northern British Columbia, Canada. The device records the passage of individual particles across the full width of the channel. At the peak of the 1999 nival flood sediment movement, approximately 3 x 10(-5) particle passages per hour were detected. The transport rate increases as the stage and water discharge increase. Bed load movement in this flood involved nearly all of the stream bed, but the point of most intense transport varied across the channel throughout the flood. During one week of flood discharge, 14.41 x 10(6) particles were recorded passing the BMD. We estimate that this is approximately equivalent to 7.88 m(3). Pulses of sediment movement are apparent at a variety of time scales ranging from diurnal to seconds. While the spasmodic character of the sediment transport is most pronounced at scales of 5 min to 1 h, there is no stable periodicity in the record.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>EROSION AND SEDIMENT TRANSPORT MEASUREMENT IN RIVERS: TECHNOLOGICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL ADVANCES</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Booth, AL</author><author>Skelton, NW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"There's a Conflict Right There": Integrating Indigenous Community Values into Commercial Forestry in the Tl'azt'en First Nation</title><secondary-title>SOCIETY &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIETY &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</full-title></periodical><pages>368-383</pages><volume>24</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>community forestry</keyword><keyword>ABORIGINAL FORESTRY</keyword><keyword>indigenous forestry</keyword><keyword>indigenous values</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0894-1920,1521-0723</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08941920902755390</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examines the experiences of the Tl'azt'en Nation, a Canadian indigenous community that became an early participant in industrial commercial forestry.

Four stands were aerially sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Defoliation and mortality levels were elevated in non-sprayed stands. The relationship between defoliation and survival-times was captured in a Cox proportional hazard model with a defoliation stress index (DSI), diameter (DBH), crown class (CCL), a random stand effect, Bt-treatment, and number of years of exposure to stand-level defoliation (DYEAR) as predictors. The DSI, optimized for discrimination between survivors and non-survivors, is the discounted sum of five lagged DF% values. Survival probabilities were predicted with a maximum error of 0.02. Hazard rates increased by 0.06 for every one point increase in DSI. CCL and random stand effects were highly significant.

Two climate simulations of western Canada (WCan) were conducted with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (version 4) at 15 (CRCM15) and 45km (CRCM45) horizontal resolution driven at the lateral boundaries by global reanalysis over the period 1973-1995. The simulations were evaluated with ANUSPLIN, a daily observational gridded surface temperature and precipitation product and with meteorological data recorded at 28 stations within the upper Peace, Nechako, and upper Columbia River basins. In this work, we focus largely on a comparison of the skill of each model configuration in simulating the 90th percentile of daily precipitation (PR90). The companion paper describes the results for a wider range of temperature and precipitation extremes over the entire WCan domain.Over all three watersheds, both simulations exhibit cold biases compared with observations, with the bias exacerbated at higher resolution. Although both simulations generally display wet biases in median precipitation, CRCM15 features a reduced bias in PR90 in all three basins in summer and throughout the year in the upper Columbia River basin. However, the higher resolution model is inferior to CRCM45 with respect to rarer heavy precipitation events and also displays high spatial variability and lower spatial correlations with ANUSPLIN compared with the coarser resolution model. A reduction in the range of PR90 biases over the upper Columbia basin is noted when the 15km results are averaged to the 45km grid. This improvement is partly attributable to the averaging of errors between different elevation data used in the gridded observations and CRCM, but the sensitivity of CRCM15 to resolved topography is also clear from spatial maps of seasonal extremes. At the station scale, modest but systematic reductions in the bias of PR90 relative to ANUSPLIN are again found when the CRCM15 results are averaged to the 45km grid. Furthermore, the annual cycle of inter-station spatial variance in the upper Columbia River basin is well reproduced by CRCM15 but not by ANUSPLIN or CRCM45. The former result highlights the beneficial effect of spatial averaging of small-scale climate variability, whereas the latter is evidently a demonstration of the added value at high resolution vis-a-vis the improved simulation of precipitation at the resolution limit of the model. RESUME[Traduit par la redaction] Nous evaluons la capacite d'un modele regional de climat a simuler les statistiques d'evenements extremes. Nous examinons aussi l'effet de diverses resolutions horizontales, a l'echelle de basins hydrologiques individuels, en Colombie-Britannique, une province du Canada a la topographie complexe. Deux simulations du climat pour l'ouest du Canada ont ete menees avec le Modele regional canadien du climat (version 4), a une resolution horizontale de 15km (MRCC15) et de 45km (MRCC45). Les conditions limites provenaient de reanalyses mondiales s'etendant de 1973 a 1995. Les simulations ont ete evaluees a l'aide d'ANUSPLIN, un produit representant sur une grille les observations quotidiennes de temperature en surface et de precipitations, et avec des donnees meteorologiques mesurees a 28 stations situees dans les bassins versants de la partie superieure de la riviere de la Paix, de la Nechako et du haut Columbia. Dans cette etude, nous nous attardons surtout a comparer la capacite de chaque configuration du modele a simuler le 90(e) centile des precipitations quotidiennes (PR90). L'etude connexe presente les resultats pour un large eventail d'extremes de temperatures et de precipitations sur le domaine entier de l'ouest du Canada.Pour les trois bassins, les deux simulations presentent un biais froid par rapport aux observations. Ce biais est exacerbe a haute resolution. Bien que les deux simulations montrent un biais humide relativement aux precipitations medianes, le MRCC15 possede un biais reduit pour le PR90, et ce, dans les trois bassins en ete, et tout au long de l'annee dans le bassin du haut Columbia. Toutefois, le modele a haute resolution reste inferieur au MRCC45 en ce qui concerne les cas rares de fortes precipitations. Il montre aussi une grande variabilite spatiale et de moindres correlations spatiales avec ANUSPLIN, en comparaison avec le modele de resolution inferieure. Une reduction de l'ecart des biais du PR90 pour le bassin du haut Columbia ressort quand les resultats de modele a 15km sont lisses sur la grille de 45km. Cette amelioration s'avere en partie attribuable au lissage des erreurs relativement aux diverses donnees d'elevation utilisees pour les observations reparties sur la grille et dans le MRCC, mais la capacite du MRCC15 a resoudre la topographie est aussi evidente sur les cartes spatiales des extremes saisonniers. l'echelle de la station, des reductions modestes mais systematiques du biais du PR90 relativement a ANUSPLIN ressortent quand les resultats du MRCC15 sont lisses sur la grille de 45km. De plus, le MRCC15 reproduit bien le cycle annuel des variances spatiales entre les stations du bassin du haut Columbia, mais ni ANUSPLIN ni le MRCC45 n'y parviennent. De ces deux resultats, le premier revele l'effet benefique du lissage spatial des variabilites climatiques de petite echelle. Le second demontre nettement la valeur ajoutee de la haute resolution en raison de la simulation amelioree des precipitations a la limite de la resolution du modele.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leckie, DG</author><author>Walsworth, N</author><author>Dechka, J</author><author>Wulder, M</author><author>IEEE, IEEE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An investigation of two date unsupervised classification in the context of a national program for Landsat based forest change mapping</title></titles><periodical><full-title>IGARSS 2002: IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM AND 24TH CANADIAN SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING, VOLS I-VI, PROCEEDINGS: REMOTE SENSING: INTEGRATING OUR VIEW OF THE PLANET</full-title></periodical><pages>1307-1311</pages><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0-7803-7536-X</isbn><abstract>A number of change mapping methods are being evaluated as part of a national program for monitoring Canada's forest cover, change and biomass (Earth Observation for Sustainable Development - EOSD). One approach being evaluated involves a simple two date multispectral unsupervised classification approach to map forest change at a national scale with Landsat data. Key factors are the types and consistency of change classes that emerge from the clustering algorithms and issues related to labelling these into desired change classes. The technique was investigated using two sites. Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada used 1990 and 1999 imagery. The second site of Petawawa in eastern Ontario, has fifteen images from a time period from 1984 to 2001 that were normalized and then analyzed in various image pairs. Utilizing the six visible and infrared Landsat bands from each of two dates in a K-means hyperclustering, classes of conifer, hardwood and mixedwood that had not changed were separated. Before any amalgamation, many clusters were associated with change, especially changes in vegetation on old cuts and open fields. Post-clearing ground vegetation density and type had a moderate influence on the clustering process. Pre-clearing forest type was only a factor in general terms, for example whether it was hardwood, softwood or mixedwood. Clearcuts often had several clusters associated with them, but were well detected when clusters were amalgamated. Partial cuts were only partly detected. The length of time after the cut was an important consideration in their detection. They were detectable for only 2 or 3 years after the cutting. The above approach is expected to be one of several tools used in the EOSD initiative.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>IGARSS 2002: IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM AND 24TH CANADIAN SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING, VOLS I-VI, PROCEEDINGS: REMOTE SENSING: INTEGRATING OUR VIEW OF THE PLANET</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Karjala, M</author><author>Dewhurst, S</author><author>Grainger, S</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Arthaudf, GJ,Barrett, TM</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Cooperative forest planning using criteria, indicators and systems analysis</title></titles><periodical><full-title>SYSTEMS ANALYSIS IN FOREST RESOURCES, PROCEEDINGS</full-title></periodical><pages>123-125</pages><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>Aboriginal forestry</keyword><keyword>criteria and indicators</keyword><keyword>planning</keyword><keyword>systems analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1-4020-1256-X</isbn><abstract>A systems analysis approach is being used to co-manage the 13,000-hectare John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in Central British Columbia.

To identify, from the perspectives of people with spinal cord injury (SCI), (a) appropriate components of a fatigue management programme; and (b) important outcomes or indicators of success. Method. Collaborative, qualitative methodology comprising four focus groups undertaken simultaneously in Kelowna, Prince George, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Participants included a purposive sample of 21 men and women with complete and incomplete SCI of high and low tetraplegia and paraplegia. Two family members, two care-providing assistants and four occupational therapists provided additional information (total n = 29). Interpretive data analysis identified common themes addressing each research question. Results. Building on those strategies they perceived to facilitate coping with fatigue, the participants identified 10 components of a helpful fatigue management programme. Dimensions of 'successful' outcomes from such a programme reflected quality of life concerns: enabling people with SCI to do the things they value, enhancing their sense of control over their lives, reducing pain and helplessness, increasing motivation and enhancing relationships strained by fatigue. Conclusions. This study identifies many of the necessary elements of a fatigue management programme to meet the specific needs of people with SCI; and ascertains important indicators of a successful programme from the perspectives of those who must live with the outcomes.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehrabadi, A</author><author>Paterson, K</author><author>Pearce, M</author><author>Patel, S</author><author>Craib, KJP</author><author>Moniruzzaman, A</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gender Differences in HIV and Hepatitis C Related Vulnerabilities Among Aboriginal Young People Who Use Street Drugs in Two Canadian Cities</title><secondary-title>WOMEN &amp; HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WOMEN &amp; HEALTH</full-title></periodical><pages>235-260</pages><volume>48</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>VANCOUVER</keyword><keyword>drug use</keyword><keyword>WOMEN</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal</keyword><keyword>AIDS</keyword><keyword>gender</keyword><keyword>HCV</keyword><keyword>hepatitis C</keyword><keyword>injection</keyword><keyword>CHILDHOOD</keyword><keyword>INJECTION-DRUGS</keyword><keyword>PREVENTION</keyword><keyword>RISK BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>sex work</keyword><keyword>sexual abuse</keyword><keyword>SEXUAL-ABUSE</keyword><keyword>VIOLENCE</keyword><keyword>women</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0363-0242,1541-0331</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/03630240802463186</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives: Vulnerability to HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection for indigenous populations worldwide must be contextualized in experiences of current and past trauma. Aboriginal women entrenched in poverty face further gender-specific harms which place them at increased risk for HIV infection. Methods: This study was cross-sectional and based on a community-based sample of Aboriginal young people (Metis, Aboriginal, First Nations, Inuit, and non-status Indians) between the ages of 14 and 30 years who used injection or non-injection non-cannabis illegal drugs (street drugs) in the previous month. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 543 participants living in either Vancouver or Prince George, Canada, were recruited by word of mouth, posters, and street outreach. Young people in the study completed a questionnaire administered by Aboriginal interviewers. Female participants (n = 262) were compared to male participants (n = 281) with respect to sociodemographics, trauma, sexual risk variables, and drug use patterns. Trained nurses drew blood samples for HIV and HCV antibodies and provided pre- and Post-test counseling. Results: Proportions positive for HIV and HCV were significantly higher among young women. HIV was 13.1% [9.5, 1.7.7] in women compared to 4.3% [2.5, 7.4] in men, and HCV was 43.6% [37.6, 49.8] in women as compared to 25.4% [20.5, 30.9] in men. When the analysis was restricted to young people who reported injection drug use, the proportions positive for HIV and HCV remained significantly higher among young women. Experiences of forced sex were reported by 70% of young women compared to 29% of young men, p &lt; 0.001, while the median age of first forced sex was 6-years-old for both men and women. Discussion: The results of the final model indicated that HIV had been associated with residing in Vancouver, having injected for longer, and sexual abuse, but not being female. However, this gendered analysis demonstrated that a greater proportion of young women were experiencing sexual abuse, and sexual abuse was associated with HIV positive status. Harm reduction and drug treatment programs are urgently required that target women at a young age and address complex traumatic experiences associated with childhood sexual abuse.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Halverson, MJ</author><author>Fleming, SW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Complex network theory, streamflow, and hydrometric monitoring system design</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>3301-3318</pages><volume>19</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>COMMUNITY STRUCTURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1027-5606,1607-7938</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-19-3301-2015</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Network theory is applied to an array of stream-flow gauges located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (BC) and Yukon, Canada. The goal of the analysis is to assess whether insights from this branch of mathematical graph theory can be meaningfully applied to hydrometric data, and, more specifically, whether it may help guide decisions concerning stream gauge placement so that the full complexity of the regional hydrology is efficiently captured. The streamflow data, when represented as a complex network, have a global clustering coefficient and average shortest path length consistent with small-world networks, which are a class of stable and efficient networks common in nature, but the observed degree distribution did not clearly indicate a scale-free network. Stability helps ensure that the network is robust to the loss of nodes; in the context of a streamflow network, stability is interpreted as insensitivity to station removal at random. Community structure is also evident in the streamflow network. A network theoretic community detection algorithm identified separate communities, each of which appears to be defined by the combination of its median seasonal flow regime (pluvial, nival, hybrid, or glacial, which in this region in turn mainly reflects basin elevation) and geographic proximity to other communities (reflecting shared or different daily meteorological forcing). Furthermore, betweenness analyses suggest a handful of key stations which serve as bridges between communities and might be highly valued. We propose that an idealized sampling network should sample high-betweenness stations, small-membership communities which are by definition rare or undersampled relative to other communities, and index stations having large numbers of intracommunity links, while retaining some degree of redundancy to maintain network robustness.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;54 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;56 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Booth, AL</author><author>Aben, K</author><author>Otter, B</author><author>Corrigall, T</author><author>Ray, C</author><author>Earley, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbon management and community-based action learning: a theory to work experience</title><secondary-title>ACTION LEARNING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ACTION LEARNING</full-title></periodical><pages>62-71</pages><volume>17</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>carbon management</keyword><keyword>experiential learning</keyword><keyword>University action learning</keyword><keyword>university-community partnerships</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-7333,1476-7341</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14767333.2020.1712845</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We discuss an innovative action-learning course co-developed by the University of Northern British Columbia, the Prince George Chamber of Commerce (Canada) and local businesses.

The benefit to the original owner of the water rights, the Province of British Columbia, was economic and population growth. The purpose of this paper is to follow the contestation over these rights from 1948 to 2016. Design/methodology/approach An institutional logics perspective was taken to analyze the main actors and how their relative power (dominant versus fringe) changed in the institutional field. Archival data and selected interviews were mapped to institutional logics across three time periods. Findings In the inter-temporal setting, many of the actors that were fringe in 1950 became more dominant by 2016. For example, the local indigenous peoples, the Cheslatta Carrier First Nation, were flooded off their land to make way for Alcan's dam. They ended up as very powerful players in the institutional field. The perpetual rights given to Alcan made it a dominant actor across all time periods, despite changes in the logics of the institutional field. Research limitations/implications A single case was studied; other comparative settings should be explored to contrast and compare. The data were primarily archival, supplemented by only three interviews of those related to the case study. This case study is also one where water rights were privatized in perpetuity, which may not be the case in other settings. Practical implications Current governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should use this case to understand the long-term effects of resource policy decisions. Social implications The building of large dams has been, and continues to be, used worldwide to provide power to create economic growth. Our setting provides insight into the long-term societal outcomes of using water rights in this way. Originality/value This is an original use of institutional logics around a natural resource-based institutional field. Using institutional logics in a multi-period setting, focusing on the power relations of the key actors, and how they can be constrained by historical forces, provides a contribution to the literature.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Jongbloed, K</author><author>Pooyak, S</author><author>Christian, KWM</author><author>Teegee, MGM</author><author>Caron, NR</author><author>Thomas, V</author><author>Henderson, E</author><author>Zamar, D</author><author>Yoshida, EM</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: exploring the role of colonial harms and childhood maltreatment on HIV and hepatitis C infection in a cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in two Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>BMJ OPEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BMJ OPEN</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>epidemiology</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>WOMEN</keyword><keyword>ABUSE</keyword><keyword>HIV &amp; AIDS</keyword><keyword>mental health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2044-6055</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1136/bmjopen-2020-042545</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives This study examined associations between childhood maltreatment, colonial harms and sex/drug-related risks for HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among young Indigenous people who use drugs. Design The Cedar Project is a cohort involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia (BC), Canada. Indigenous collaborators, collectively known as the Cedar Project Partnership, govern the entire research process. Setting Vancouver is a large city on the traditional territory of the Coast Salish peoples. Prince George is a mid-sized city, on the traditional territory of Lheidli T'enneh First Nation. Participants 420 participants completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire and returned for follow-up from 2003 to 2016. Primary/secondary outcome measures Primary outcomes were HIV and HCV infection over the study period. Secondary outcomes included sex and substance use-related risks. Results Prevalence of childhood maltreatment was 92.6% experienced any maltreatment; 73.4% experienced emotional abuse; 62.6% experienced physical abuse; 60.3% experienced sexual abuse; 69.5% experienced emotional neglect and 79.1% experienced physical neglect. We observed significant associations between childhood maltreatment and apprehensions into residential schools and foster care.

Aboriginal people have been especially assertive in politicizing the connections between time and place through the display and performance of memory in forms as diverse as life history narratives. the cultural landscape, media and grass-roots development projects. Such constructions suggest that future developments in traditional lands must come through an engagement with the past - its meanings, practices, and significance in the particular places of cultural and economic production. I explore how Dakelh territories serve as sites for imagining and enacting alternative political and development agendas. I argue that these territories have increasingly become spaces forged in the margins of modernity's binary oppositions of self-other, nature-culture and future-past. This finding is not meant to marginalize indigenous territories conceptually or politically, but rather to recognize their centrality to contemporary provincial politics where margins - both geographic and discursive - have become central locations for pursuing sovereignty over land and nation.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bakri, T</author><author>Jackson, P</author><author>Doherty, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Along-Channel Winds in Howe Sound: Climatological Analysis and Case Studies</title><secondary-title>ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN</full-title></periodical><pages>12-30</pages><volume>55</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>EVENT</keyword><keyword>ALASKA</keyword><keyword>FJORD</keyword><keyword>gap winds</keyword><keyword>GAP WINDS</keyword><keyword>Howe Sound</keyword><keyword>inflow</keyword><keyword>JUAN-DE-FUCA</keyword><keyword>NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS</keyword><keyword>outflow</keyword><keyword>SAR wind images</keyword><keyword>STRAIT</keyword><keyword>TOPOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics</keyword><keyword>wind profile</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0705-5900,1480-9214</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07055900.2016.1233094</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper examines along-channel winds within Howe Sound, British Columbia, Canada, that occur from both the interior plateau out toward the coast as outflows and from the coast inland as inflows. First, the relationships between along-channel winds and pressure, temperature, and humidity are explored in Howe Sound-Cheakamus Valley. The pressure gradients between Pam Rocks and Squamish and Pam Rocks and Pemberton have the strongest correlations with outflow strength and that between Pam Rocks and Squamish has the strongest correlation with inflow strength. Outflows (inflows) have lower (higher) temperatures and dew point temperatures, except for the inflows in summer, which have lower dewpoint temperatures than the overall mean. Second, two case studies of outflow events are presented and described during the period of intensive observations prior to and during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. The January 2010 outflow event is caused by a zone of strong across-barrier mean sea level pressure gradient. The pressure gradient is formed behind an Arctic front that moved southward across Howe Sound. The February 2010 outflow event is caused by an approaching sea level low pressure centre from the Pacific that formed a northeast-southwest mean sea level pressure gradient across southern British Columbia. In the January case, the outflow layer is about 1.5 km deep, while it is shallower in the February case. Only the January outflow case exhibits hydraulic behaviour.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petticrew, EL</author><author>Biickert, SL</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Summer, W,Klaghofer, E</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of sediment transport and storage in the upstream portion of the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada)</title></titles><periodical><full-title>MODELLING SOIL EROSION, SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CLOSELY RELATED HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>383-391</pages><keywords><keyword>SUSPENDED SEDIMENT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0144-7815,1-901502-50-3</isbn><abstract>Several techniques to determine the in-situ size, morphology, settling and storage characteristics of fine grained sediment have been used in the Fraser River at Prince George. The river was sampled both upstream and downstream of the effluent outflow of a major pulp mill (Northwood) to determine the role of this effluent in modifying the transport and storage of sediments, Both the natural suspended sediment load (upstream) and the effluent-sediment mix (downstream) were characterized by concentration, organic/inorganic ratios and image analysis to identify the presence and size of aggregates or flocs in the water column. Preliminary analysis of the data from the first eight months of 1997 indicates seasonal changes in flee size of the natural sediments but no significant difference between sites upstream and downstream of the effluent pipe. Buried gravel traps were used to quantify and characterize the amount of fine grained storage in the gravel bed during the post flooding period. Over short periods (four days) abundant fine grained (&lt;63 mu m) material was collected. The modal size of the constituent particles in the size class below 150 mu m was 40-60 mu m This storage of silts and clays in the gravel bed is important in the context of both habitat quality and sediment associated contaminant transfers.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>MODELLING SOIL EROSION, SEDIMENT TRANSPORT AND CLOSELY RELATED HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>e Leeuw, S</author><author>Maurice, S</author><author>Holyk, T</author><author>Greenwood, M</author><author>Adam, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>With Reserves: Colonial Geographies and First Nations Health</title><secondary-title>ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ANNALS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN GEOGRAPHERS</full-title></periodical><pages>904-911</pages><volume>102</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>CARE</keyword><keyword>British Columbia colonialism</keyword><keyword>CARTOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>CHILDREN</keyword><keyword>COMPLEXITY</keyword><keyword>CONSTRUCTIONS</keyword><keyword>First Nations' health</keyword><keyword>MENTAL-HEALTH</keyword><keyword>POPULATION HEALTH</keyword><keyword>social and geographic determinants</keyword><keyword>SOCIAL DETERMINANTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0004-5608,1467-8306</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/00045608.2012.674897</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples persist globally.

An understanding of birch's genecology is important to deploy it successfully. Eighteen paper birch populations (49-558 degrees N) were collected from five distinct geographic regions in BC to determine whether observed variability in spring bud phenology was due to genetics, the growing environment or their interaction. Seedlings were grown at three common gardens in Prince George (53 degrees 45'N), Salmon Arm (50 degrees 47'N) and Victoria (48 degrees 29'N) to observe the bud break. Further a controlled photoperiod, a root zone temperature and a translocation experiment from the northern to central garden were conducted to investigate the effect of photoperiod and root temperature on birch bud break. Results revealed that timing of spring bud phenology in paper birch is under genetic and environmental control, following climatic clines based on latitude from south to north. Bud flush at the southern common garden was on an average 25 days earlier and required 177 more growing degree day than the northern common garden. Conversely, our controlled experiments and seed source translocation experiment showed that the signal for the onset of spring bud flush is controlled by air temperature, soil temperature, and photoperiod. These results allow us to characterize spring budburst phenology of paper birch and begin to consider seed zones and seed zone transfer guidelines for BC.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;55</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ding, C</author><author>McAuley, L</author><author>Meitner, MJ</author><author>El-Kassaby, YA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating Interior Spruce Seed Deployment with GIS-Based Modeling Using British Columbia's Prince George Seed Planning Zone as a Model</title><secondary-title>SILVAE GENETICA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SILVAE GENETICA</full-title></periodical><pages>271-279</pages><volume>61</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>ECOSYSTEM</keyword><keyword>SYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>CONSERVATION</keyword><keyword>Deployment in time and space</keyword><keyword>FOREST TREES</keyword><keyword>GAP ANALYSIS</keyword><keyword>GENETIC-RESOURCES</keyword><keyword>Geographical information system</keyword><keyword>Interior spruce</keyword><keyword>PINE</keyword><keyword>Seed Planning Zone</keyword><keyword>TRANSFER GUIDELINES</keyword><keyword>Wild stands and seed orchard seed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0037-5349,2509-8934</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1515/sg-2012-0034</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The maintenance, protection, and conservation of forest genetic resources for economic, ecological and social benefits are daunting tasks. Understanding how reforestation materials are spatially and temporally deployed across the landscape is an integral component of forest genetic resources management. To improve the current understanding of how reforestation materials are deployed in British Columbia (BC), we developed a geographical information systems (GIS) method to track seed deployment across silviculture openings. Generally, reforestation materials can originate from either natural stand (wild seed collections) or orchards' seed sources (improved seed); the latter are produced within the framework of specific tree improvement program designed for a particular species within a well-defined seed deployment area, commonly known as Seed Planning Zone (SPZ). In this paper, we present a GIS-based method for evaluating seed deployment patterns for interior spruce (Picea glauca and Picea engelmannii and their natural hybrids) within the Prince George SPZ. The evaluation period (1970-2004) is associated with wild stands and improved seed availability and the dynamic of each seed source proportionate contribution followed three distinct phases; namely, developing (1970-1987), immature (1988-1994), and mature (1995-2004) with a progressive increase of orchards' seed use over time. The developed method is scalable across SPZs of the same species or multiple species, thus providing the means to: 1) temporally and spatially monitor improved and natural stands seed deployment over the landscape; and 2) identify areas of concerns where a particular seed source is over-represented which might pose an increased genetic vulnerability. The present study revealed that the current interior spruce orchard's seed use within the Prince George SPZ is expected to exceed the provincial goal of performance target of 75% by 2014. Additionally, areas of excessive use of one seed orchard seed were identified.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, M</author><author>Wei, X</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of cumulative forest disturbance on streamflow in a large watershed in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>2021-2034</pages><volume>16</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>CATCHMENT</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE VARIABILITY</keyword><keyword>HYDROLOGY</keyword><keyword>LAND-COVER CHANGE</keyword><keyword>RIVER-BASIN</keyword><keyword>SENSITIVITY</keyword><keyword>VEGETATION CHANGES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1027-5606,1607-7938</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-16-2021-2012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Baker Creek watershed (1570 km(2)), situated in the central interior of British Columbia, Canada, has been severely disturbed by both logging and natural disturbance, particularly by a recent large-scale mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestation (up to 2009, 70.2% of the watershed area had been attacked by MPB) and subsequent salvage logging. The concept of equivalent clear-cut area (ECA) was used to indicate the magnitude of forest disturbance, with consideration of hydrological recovery following various types of disturbance (wildfire, logging and MPB infestation), cumulated over space and time in the watershed. The cumulative ECA peaked at 62.2% in 2009. A combined approach of statistical analysis (i.e. time series analysis) and graphic method (modified double mass curve) was employed to evaluate the impacts of forest disturbance on hydrology. Our results showed that severe forest disturbance significantly increased annual mean flow. The average increment in annual mean flow caused by forest disturbance was 48.4 mm yr(-1), while the average decrease in annual mean flow caused by climatic variability during the same disturbance period was 35.5 mm yr(-1). The opposite changes in directions and magnitudes clearly suggest an offsetting effect between forest disturbance and climatic variability, with the absolute influential strength of forest disturbance (57.7%) overriding that from climate variability (42.3%). Forest disturbance also produced significant positive effects on low flow and dry season (fall and winter) mean flow. Implications of our findings for future forest and water resources management are discussed in the context of long-term watershed sustainability.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;50 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Skakun, R</author><author>Franklin, SE</author><author>Wulder, MA</author><author>Carroll, A</author><author>IEEE, IEEE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aerial, GIS, and field data calibration of a Landsat ETM plus mountain pine beetle detection procedure in British Columbia, Canada</title></titles><periodical><full-title>IGARSS 2002: IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM AND 24TH CANADIAN SYMPOSIUM ON REMOTE SENSING, VOLS I-VI, PROCEEDINGS: REMOTE SENSING: INTEGRATING OUR VIEW OF THE PLANET</full-title></periodical><pages>2887-2889</pages><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0-7803-7536-X</isbn><abstract>The identification and classification of mountain pine beetle, Dentroctonus ponderosa (Hopkins), red-attack damage patterns in a mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest located in the Fort St. James Forest District, British Columbia, was accomplished using 1999 Landsat ETM+ satellite imagery, a 1999 mountain pine beetle field and aerial survey point dataset, and GIS forest inventory data.

Baker Creek, located in the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada, is in the heart of the infested region. This study relates observed and modelled changes in hydrology to geomorphic controls to predict the potential for channel change. Modelling using the Distributed-Hydrology-Soil-Vegetation-Model indicates that discharge is highly sensitive to tree kill and salvage logging, with increases of 65-100% possible. It was found that low-gradient reaches typical of the interior plateau are likely to be relatively insensitive to channel change, but will become significant sediment stores as sediment is mobilized elsewhere in the catchment. Higher gradient reaches, which typically occur where interior rivers incise to meet the Fraser River, are more susceptible to change. A geomorphic threshold classification was able to identify change channel thresholds. Salvage harvesting scenarios exceeding 40% cause some reaches to cross stability thresholds, with the potential for significant changes in channel morphology.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>COLD AND MOUNTAIN REGION HYDROLOGICAL SYSTEMS UNDER CLIMATE CHANGE: TOWARDS IMPROVED PROJECTIONS</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Margold, M</author><author>Jansson, KN</author><author>Kleman, J</author><author>Stroeven, AP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glacial meltwater landforms of central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF MAPS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF MAPS</full-title></periodical><pages>486-506</pages><volume>7</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>HISTORY</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN</keyword><keyword>STRATIGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>CORDILLERAN ICE-SHEET</keyword><keyword>CHANNELS</keyword><keyword>ESKER</keyword><keyword>PATTERNS</keyword><keyword>RECONSTRUCTION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1744-5647</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4113/jom.2011.1205</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS), which grew and melted repeatedly across the mountain ranges of westernmost Canada during the late Cenozoic, has imprinted its legacy in the form of glacial landforms, such as meltwater landforms. However, despite their abundance, a coherent effort to map meltwater landforms has been lacking. Here, we present a first regional geomorphological map of glacial meltwater landforms of central British Columbia. Series of well-developed meltwater channels occur at higher elevations on the Interior Plateau, in marginal ranges east of the Coast Mountains, in the Skeena and Omineca mountains, and, in much lower abundances, in the Rocky Mountains. Single-ridged eskers, that in direction are consistent with the regional ice flow direction from glacial lineations, occur in elevated areas of the Interior Plateau. Multiple-ridged larger eskers and esker complexes are, on the other hand, confined to the main topographic lows. The geographical distribution of meltwater landforms is a new reliable dataset for use in palaeoglaciological reconstructions and inference of late glacial ice sheet dynamics in central British Columbia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;85</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Booth, AL</author><author>Ryan, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Goldilocks Revisited: Public Perceptions of Urban Bears in Northern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HUMAN DIMENSIONS OF WILDLIFE</full-title></periodical><pages>460-470</pages><volume>21</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bears</keyword><keyword>management implications</keyword><keyword>suburban wildlife</keyword><keyword>urban wildlife</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1087-1209,1533-158X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10871209.2016.1183730</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Management of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban settings is of growing concern because they often recolonize areas from which they had been extirpated. Urban landscapes offer much needed bear habitat, buffer habitat losses in other areas, and offer protection for bear populations, but only if conflicts between bears and humans are managed. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, a survey of a sample of Prince George residents was conducted to determine their attitudes toward black bears and bear management, including euthanasia (N = 71). These residents tended to feel positively toward black bears, but were split on the issue of euthanasia, with half being firmly opposed and half recognizing the need under certain conditions. There was a significant preference for non-lethal management tools, suggesting an opportunity for governments to explore options for managing human activities that created bear attractants.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ebata, T</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Shore, TL,Brooks, JE,Stone, JE</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Current status of mountain pine beetle in British Columbia</title></titles><periodical><full-title>MOUNTAIN PINE BEETLE SYMPOSIUM: CHALLENGES AND SOLUTIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>52-56</pages><volume>399</volume><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0830-0453,0-662-38389-3</isbn><abstract>Province-wide aerial overview surveys have been conducted in British Columbia by the Ministry of Forests since 1999 and earlier by the Forest Insect and Disease Survey, Canadian Forest Service.

In order to examine the radial growth response of mountain hemlock to subseasonal climate variables, ring-width and X-ray densitometric analyses were used to construct intra-annual dendroclimatic records. The intent was to highlight the difference between the dendroclimatic outcomes of standard ring-width analyses to those derived from density chronologies collected at high elevation locations in the British Columbia Coast Mountains. This study highlights the importance of using multiple tree-ring parameters to better define the complex growth behaviour in mountain hemlock trees for the construction of more robust proxy climate records. Tree-ring chronologies from three sites were used to describe the inherent climate-growth trends. Maximum tree-ring density values provided a robust data series for constructing site-specific proxy records of late-summer temperature. Annual ring-width measurements provided independent proxies of spring snowpack trends. Significant decreases in temperature and an increase in snowpack depth during the early 1700s and early 1800s coincides with documented PDO phases and Little Ice Age glacier advances. Identification of early and late growing season climate signals within mountain hemlock trees demonstrates the value of documenting the characteristics of multiple tree ring parameters in future dendroclimatic studies.

Karst can host unique flora and subsurface fauna, as well as a wide range of other scientific, recreational and cultural values. Karst and potential karst areas underlie approximately 10% of British Columbia (BC), but the distribution and extent of this landscape has yet to be fully explored and delineated. Some of the most extensive and well-developed karst areas occur within the forested limestone areas of coastal BC, such as on Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii, where numerous surface karst features and caves are known. Karst in the interior plateau regions of British Columbia is less well known, being in part covered by thick deposits of glacial materials. Alpine karst regions are most apparent in the Rocky Mountains where there are limestone plateaus, karst drainages and cave systems that have close connections to past and present glacial systems. Mapping of karst is a critical component for any land-use or resource development activity in all regions of British Columbia, as the environmental impacts on karst and its associated values are potentially significant. The regional distribution of karst in BC is not well mapped, with only an office-based reconnaissance karst potential map (1:250,000-scale) and a related database completed in 1999. A renewed effort should now be made to better map karst across British Columbia using digital bedrock mapping data released in 2017, combined with more recent satellite imagery and improved field knowledge.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;69</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pun, SB</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The implications and challenges of First Nations forestry negotiations in British Columbia, Canada: The Tl'azt'en Nation experience</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE FORESTRY</full-title></periodical><pages>543-561</pages><volume>35</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>First Nations</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal interests</keyword><keyword>First Nations' consultation</keyword><keyword>forest policy</keyword><keyword>forestry negotiations</keyword><keyword>future considerations</keyword><keyword>key barriers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1054-9811,1540-756X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10549811.2016.1228071</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article examines the implications and limitations of First Nations forestry negotiations in British Columbia (BC), Canada by assessing how effectively the Tl'azt'en Nation is able to realize benefits under the current form of negotiations. The primary goal of the Tl'azt'en Nation has always been to defend their Aboriginal interests within their ancestral lands, which would entail the cessation of clear-cutting on their traditional territory. Although the community has pursued some economic opportunities in the forestry sector to improve their socioeconomic conditions, despite their efforts, the socioeconomic status of the community remains unchanged. The collective experience of the Tl'azt'en Nation illustrates that simply obtaining certain forest tenures and short-term-based revenue sharing agreements does not adequately meet their forestry and self-sufficiency goals. Without addressing the fundamental issues and challenges facing the community, the current practice of forestry negotiations between the Provincial government and the Tl'azt'en Nation has produced no significant benefits to the community.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lofroth, EC</author><author>Krebs, JA</author><author>Harrower, WL</author><author>Lewis, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Food habits of wolverine Gulo gulo in montane ecosystems of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>WILDLIFE BIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WILDLIFE BIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>31-37</pages><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>food habits</keyword><keyword>foraging</keyword><keyword>Gulo gulo</keyword><keyword>wolverine</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0909-6396,1903-220X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2981/0909-6396(2007)13[31:FHOWGG]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We examined the seasonal food habits of wolverine Gulo gulo in subboreal and interior wet-belt montane environments in British Columbia by analyzing scats collected during the course of two concurrent wolverine studies. Understanding foraging ecology for a wide-ranging carnivore such as the wolverine is important, particularly because reproduction has been demonstrated to be closely linked to food abundance. Wolverine diet was shown to vary regionally and seasonally. Regional variation was related to differences in prey availability between study areas. Moose Alces alces, caribou Rangifer tarandus, and hoary marmots Marmota caligata were abundant and common prey items within both study areas. Mountain goats Oreamnos americanus and porcupine Erithizon dorsatum were more abundant and more frequent prey items in the Columbia Mountains, while snowshoe hare Lepus americanus and beaver Castor canadensis were more abundant and more frequent prey items in the Omineca Mountains. Within the winter season, diet choices by reproductive females were different than other sex and age classes. Caribou, hoary marmots and porcupines were found in significantly higher frequencies in the diet of reproductive females. Foraging observations concurred with the findings of scat analyses. Dependence of reproductive females on a species of current conservation concern (caribou) and one which could be affected by issues related to climate change (hoary marmot) may present conservation issues for wolverines in the future.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Albers, SJ</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Petticrew, EL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Flooding in the Nechako River Basin of Canada: A random forest modeling approach to flood analysis in a regulated reservoir system</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>250-260</pages><volume>41</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>TRENDS</keyword><keyword>SALMON</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0701-1784,1918-1817</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07011784.2015.1109480</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Flooding events can have significant impacts, in terms of both loss of life and property damage. Analyzing floods to understand their processes and patterns improves our ability to predict when floods will occur. Under changing climate conditions, this will become even more important. The utility of an alternative approach to conventional flood analysis was investigated in a regulated river system with a reservoir, the Nechako River Basin located in British Columbia, Canada. Using the 1955-2008 daily discharge measured on the Nechako River discharge and its major tributaries, a random forest model was constructed to evaluate the relative importance of contributing discharges to the main stem during significant flood events in the downstream community of Prince George. Discharges from the unregulated Stellako and Nautley Rivers were found to be the most important variables during a spring flood. Conversely, during a winter flood, the regulated Skins Lake Spillway and the Kemano Powerhouse discharges were found to be the most important variables in the model. During periods of no flood, the main stem Nechako River at Isle Pierre discharge was the most important. This work provides a novel source of evidence that flow regulation on the Nechako River is an important indicator of downstream winter flood conditions in Prince George, potentially exacerbating ice jams and/or causing significant property damage and economic losses.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owens, PN</author><author>Slaymaker, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contemporary and post-glacial rates of aeolian deposition in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</full-title></periodical><pages>267-276</pages><volume>79A</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>COLORADO</keyword><keyword>USA</keyword><keyword>aeolian deposition</keyword><keyword>alpine environment</keyword><keyword>atmospheric dust fallout</keyword><keyword>CALIFORNIA</keyword><keyword>cumulic soils</keyword><keyword>ENRICHED SURFACE MANTLES</keyword><keyword>EOLIAN DUST</keyword><keyword>EPISODE</keyword><keyword>FRONT RANGE</keyword><keyword>INDIAN BASIN</keyword><keyword>ORIGIN</keyword><keyword>sediment supply</keyword><keyword>TRANSPORT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0435-3676,1468-0459</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1468-0459.00022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Contemporary and post-glacial rates of aeolian deposition are determined for three small catchments that straddle the alpine-subalpine ecotone in the Pacific Ranges of the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. From process measurement over a single year, the mean annual regional (allochthonous) rate of aeolian deposition for the catchments is estimated to be approximately 11 g m(-2). The average rate of annual deposition over the post-glacial period is calculated from the soil profiles to be c. 6 g m(-2), although fallout rates are likely to have varied significantly over the Holocene epoch due to changes in climate and catchment conditions. It would appear that the vegetated ground strata in these catchments are net receivers of aeolian dust fallout. Consequently, many of the soils are cumulic in nature and protect the bedrock in these catchments from subaerial weathering. These results have implications for sediment transfers in alpine and subalpine environments in southwestern British Columbia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macdonald, JS</author><author>Morrison, J</author><author>Patterson, DA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Efficacy of Reservoir Flow Regulation for Cooling Migration Temperature for Sockeye Salmon in the Nechako River Watershed of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>415-427</pages><volume>32</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>FRASER-RIVER</keyword><keyword>PERSPECTIVE</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>STREAM</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENTAL FLOWS</keyword><keyword>MODIFYING DAM OPERATIONS</keyword><keyword>ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA</keyword><keyword>REQUIREMENTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0275-5947</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02755947.2012.675946</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Since the early 1980s, a water temperature management program has been in existence on the Nechako River system in central British Columbia, Canada. The program releases water based on anticipated meteorological conditions in an attempt to prevent temperature from exceeding a specified threshold of 20 degrees C downstream during a period when spawning migrations of sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka are in the Nechako River. Since the inception of the program, this threshold has been exceeded only rarely; however, the variables that influence water temperature and that are used to manage water releases in the Nechako River watershed have not been subject to an independent analysis. Increasing demand for water at other times of year and a desire to restore a more natural hydrograph to the river to meet other ecological demands have impelled this analysis. A principal components analysis that examined the factors contributing to river temperature demonstrated that the summer controlled flow releases accounted for 24% of the temperature variability and were probably a factor in maintaining compliance with the program's temperature threshold. Furthermore, during most summers, the Nechako River provided a cooling influence to input from the Stuart River tributary in a downstream reach that is used by the majority of the migrating sockeye salmon. Water temperature has a modest influence on prespawning mortality (up to 22% of the variability), suggesting that attempts to reduce summer water temperatures through releases in the upper Nechako River watershed can mitigate against poor spawning success of sockeye salmon populations that migrate through the lower reaches of the system.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;66</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lyon, Christopher</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Place Systems and Social Resilience: A Framework for Understanding Place in Social Adaptation, Resilience, and Transformation</title><secondary-title>Society &amp; Natural Resources</secondary-title><short-title>Place Systems and Social Resilience</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Society &amp; Natural Resources</full-title></periodical><pages>1009-1023</pages><volume>27</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>place</keyword><keyword>social–ecological systems</keyword><keyword>community resilience</keyword><keyword>natural resources–environmental sociology</keyword><keyword>resource-dependent communities</keyword><keyword>social resilience</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-10-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0894-1920</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08941920.2014.918228</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article proposes a three-part framework for accounting for the physical and social components of place as a system in community adaptation to crisis.

This article develops a novel three-part framework—incarnate, discarnate, and chimerical place—to provide a richer description of how place acts a system to inform social adaptation to crises, and specifically how it informs community resilience or transformation.

Boundary adjustments usually involve responding to urban sprawl occurring outside the municipal limits and to development trends occurring within the city as boundaries are altered to 'make room' for urban development. There has been little research within the Canadian context on the frequency of boundary adjustments undertaken by Canadian municipalities through time and by province. Existing studies tend to focus on individual case studies, included as part of a broader urban history, or they focus on general policy implications. This paper examines the broad sweep of annexation frequencies, temporal and spatial patterns through the post-war years, 1941 to 1991, for the provinces of Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Descriptive statistical tests, such as analysis of variance, are used to examine comparisons of key variables within each province. The paper presents and analyzes statistics on annexation to answer three questions: (i) How important is annexation? One approach to this question is to assess how much annexation has taken place. The answer to this question can be taken as a partial measure of urban growth through annexation. (ii) How has annexation activity been distributed through time? Is annexation of only historical importance or are there significant contemporary events? (iii) How has annexation activity varied by province? The findings reveal that annexation is a pervasive form of local government reorganization. The frequency of annexation is shown to be related to municipal class, growth rate and population size. Annexation is also found to be unevenly distributed over time and space.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1468381290?pq-origsite=gscholar</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 19:34:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McMillan, W.

The Enbridge Corporation has applied to construct a pipeline system to deliver diluted bitumen from the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, but the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and their member communities have asserted the authority to prevent this project from passing through their unceded territories. Studying Carrier Sekani contestation of Canadian regulatory assessment of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project, we examine how the processes of Indigenous becoming exceed notions of Indigenous being that are included in the permitting process as traditional knowledge. We focus both on the performance of legal obligations to consider Aboriginal traditional knowledge and the emerging politics of Carrier Sekani resistance. Our intention is not to question the integrity of traditional knowledge that the regulatory process incorporates, but to highlight how traditional knowledge functions as an anchor for a field of governmental inquiry and action. Providing a historical and geographical context of Carrier Sekani relations with development and the state, we argue that the coding of Indigenous being as traditional works to disavow contemporary processes of Indigenous becoming that are surplus to the spatial ontology of capitalist energy development for global markets. Against efforts to sanction development on disputed territory through formal recognition of a constrained Indigeneity, Carrier Sekani people assert the sovereign authority to prevent or permit development on their lands and waterways using traditional governance systems. Broadly, this paper suggests that recognizing the ontological politics at stake in this permitting process provides a useful opening to understand continued colonial captures at work in the inclusion of traditional knowledge in environmental governance. But it also demonstrates the capacity of Indigenous resistance to these enclosures to challenge and reshape global geographies of energy, capitalism, and climate.</abstract><remote-database-name>cgj.sagepub.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://cgj.sagepub.com/content/21/1/115</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-26 22:53:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCarthy, James</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Neoliberalism and the Politics of Alternatives: Community Forestry in British Columbia and the United States</title><secondary-title>Annals of the Association of American Geographers</secondary-title><short-title>Neoliberalism and the Politics of Alternatives</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Annals of the Association of American Geographers</full-title></periodical><pages>84-104</pages><volume>96</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0004-5608</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00500.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Calls for community forestry on public forests grew in strength in both British Columbia and the United States during the 1990s, as part of a global movement touting the advantages of community control over centralized state administration of forests. Despite structural similarities, the trajectories of community forestry in the two locations diverged sharply, with community forests rapidly becoming a reality in British Columbia while similar proposals in the United States were blocked. This article explains these divergent trajectories by examining the differences in property relations, state institutions, stakeholder interests, and environmental social-movement strategies that led to nearly opposite outcomes in initially similar situations. It also analyzes community forestry in British Columbia relative to current debates over neoliberalism and alternative economies, arguing that detailed examination of such empirical examples demonstrates the utility of neoliberalism as an analytical concept.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Burns Lake, Prince George</research-notes><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8306.2006.00500.x</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-27 17:44:49</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McAdam, Steven O.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of substrate condition on habitat use and survival by white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) larvae and potential implications for recruitment</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

Velocities of 20 cm·s–1 led to significantly lower drift only at 1 dph over small gravel. Hiding occurred an average of 2.0–13.3 s after release at 0–6 dph. Predation by sculpins (Cottus spp.) on larval sturgeon also decreased significantly in response to porous substrates at 1 dph.

Opening up new markets for Canada’s oil sands, shale and off-shore gas resources will require an expansion of the pipeline system in northern British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. While navigating the regulatory approval process can be a formidable hurdle, a far greater challenge is how proponents manage the process of building relationships and consulting with affected Aboriginal communities. Failing to earn Aboriginal support for proposed projects can be a “show-stopper”.Exploration of new basins in Canada, driven by increased demand for energy in Asia, may compete with other land uses and constitutionally-protected rights and practices of indigenous peoples. Public, media and environmental response to new pipelines is often lead by the reaction of impacted communities. The task of identifying the social risks to a project, understanding the engagement process, fulfilling the regulatory consultation requirements of different jurisdictions, balancing impacts with benefits, managing issues and resolving disputes, communicating with the public and media effectively all require improved skills and approaches.The paper surveys the stakeholder engagement experience and differences in approaches for recently proposed major arctic gas and western oil pipeline projects, as well as pipelines to service Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities on the Pacific north coast, providing practical insights with possibly international application. Utilizing decision and risk analysis and scenario planning methodologies, applied to development of an Aboriginal engagement and consultation strategy, the paper examines how multi-billion dollar investments in new pipelines can be better secured by integrating stakeholder engagement into a project’s risk management design. With greater precision and improved approaches proponents can effectively manage social risks, reduce stakeholder conflict and associate project uncertainties.</abstract><remote-database-name>Silverchair</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/IPC2012-90145</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 19:01:13</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mathews, W.

It provides material for dating and for reconstructing the original form of the paleosurface on which it was deposited.

In places the low-relief surfaces had been incised to depths of 100–200 m and the valleys backfilled with mid-or late Cenozoic sediments prior to burial by the basalts. The low-relief surfaces throughout the area are believed to have been developed close to a common base level, and regional differences in their present elevation are thus largely a product of post-basalt deformation.

In order to improve the performance of SDP, this project evaluates the impact of re-updating the policy at every time step by using Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP). We present a case study of the Kemano's hydropower system on the Nechako River in British Columbia, Canada. Managed by Rio Tinto Alcan (RTA), this system is subject to large streamflow volumes in spring due to important amount of snow depth during the winter season. Therefore, the operating policy should not only maximize production but also minimize the risk of flooding. The hydrological behavior of the system is simulated with CEQUEAU, a distributed and deterministic hydrological model developed by the Institut national de la recherche scientifique - Eau, Terre et Environnement (INRS-ETE) in Quebec, Canada. On each decision time step, CEQUEAU is used to generate ESP scenarios based on historical meteorological sequences and the current state of the hydrological model. These scenarios are used into the SDP to optimize the new release policy for the next time steps. This routine is then repeated over the entire simulation period. Results are compared with those obtained by using SDP on historical inflow scenarios.</abstract><remote-database-name>NASA ADS</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014AGUFM.H11F0921M</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-10-11 01:46:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Markey, Sean</author><author>Halseth, Greg</author><author>Manson, Don</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Capacity, scale and place: pragmatic lessons for doing community-based research in the rural setting</title><secondary-title>The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien</secondary-title><short-title>Capacity, scale and place</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien</full-title></periodical><pages>158-176</pages><volume>54</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Rural development</keyword><keyword>community-based research</keyword><keyword>développement rural</keyword><keyword>recherche communautaire</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1541-0064.2009.00284.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Community-based research (CBR) represents a particularly timely approach to rural research. Rural areas in industrialized nations are undergoing dramatic and rapid processes of economic, social and political restructuring. These forces, combined with a trend towards place-based development and territorial policy make CBR an appropriate rural method given its flexibility and sensitivity to local context. The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the use and methods of CBR in the rural setting, drawn from our collective research experience in northern British Columbia. There has been increased attention paid to CBR, signalling a form of acceptance within the academy towards community-based and participatory methods. However, gaps exist in addressing the various approaches to conducting CBR and in considering the relevance of CBR in different contexts. Researchers also note the need for better training in the use of community-based methods. We reflect upon our rural CBR experience to offer insights and pragmatic lessons on effective methodological practices using a simplified framework of the key research process stages: preparing for community engagement, doing community-based research and after the fieldwork.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1541-0064.2009.00284.x/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marcolongo, Tullia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Pits: BC's Huckleberry mine raises more concerns about flaws in the environmental assessment process, and conflicts of interest in government</title><secondary-title>Alternatives Journal</secondary-title><short-title>The Pits</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Alternatives Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>4-5</pages><volume>23</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Environmental aspects</keyword><keyword>Copper</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Mining industry</keyword><keyword>Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Native peoples</keyword><keyword>environment</keyword><keyword>Environmental Studies</keyword><keyword>Environmental conditions</keyword><keyword>Environmental protection</keyword><keyword>Environmental impact statements</keyword><keyword>Exploration &amp; development</keyword><keyword>International</keyword><keyword>Mineral resources</keyword><keyword>Mines</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>12057398</isbn><abstract>In July, the Cheslatta sought an injunction from the BC Supreme Court to halt work on an access road. The presiding judge, Justice Robert Hutchison, known as the "one-day judge", abruptly ended the hearing claiming that Cheslatta's lawyer, Karen Wristen, had "just run out of time." She was unable to finish her closing arguments. After months of delays, the BC Supreme Court will finally hear the legal arguments from both sides in mid February 1997. The Huckleberry Project Committee, composed of representatives from Environment Canada, the BC Ministry of Environment, Lands and Parks, the BC Mines Branch, as well as the Cheslatta and Wet'suwet'en First Nations, reviewed the mine proposal. However, Cheslatta critics say the committee's deliberations were based on incomplete information concerning metal concentration, toxin leachate, water quality and other hydrological factors. When more information was provided, specifically about the chemical characterization of the ore and design of the mine, it was not properly referred back to the project committee for full reassessment. The committee also lacked adequate information regarding the habitat and migratory patterns of fish, birds and wildlife that will be affected by the mine. A major claim of the mining lobby has been that BC will gain substantial economic benefits from the Huckleberry project. In 1995, Alan Savage, president of New Canamin Resources Ltd., sent a letter to then employment and investment minister Glen Clark, stating that "with export sales value in excess of $100 million per year at today's metal prices, this project can provide a significant contribution not only to the people of the Bulkley Valley, but, indeed, the province as a whole." Mine opponents say the Huckleberry mine will only employ approximately 200 people while all the ore will be shipped to Japan for processing.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/218748950?pq-origsite=gscholar</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 21:07:22</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manson, Don</author><author>Markey, Sean</author><author>Ryser, Laura</author><author>Halseth, Greg</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Recession Response: Cyclical Problems and Local Solutions in Northern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Economic and Social Geography</secondary-title><short-title>Recession Response</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Economic and Social Geography</full-title><abbr-1>Tijdschr Econ Soc Geogr</abbr-1></periodical><pages>100-114</pages><volume>107</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Community development</keyword><keyword>recession</keyword><keyword>Rural development</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-02-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1467-9663</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/tesg.12153</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The purpose of this paper is to trace community and regional responses to the economic downturn of 2008/2009 in Northern British Columbia, Canada. Our research during this period (2009–2011), the Northern Economic Vision II (NEV II) project, sought to investigate whether communities in the region were incorporating some of the core findings, lessons from an earlier project, the NEV I project (conducted in 2002–2005), in terms of preparing for both economic uncertainty and opportunity through place-oriented community planning and enhanced regional collaboration. Findings suggest that in the face of economic hardship, many communities continued to pursue community and regionally-oriented strategies in an attempt to preserve services and quality of life for local residents, and did not engage in reactive budget cuts in the face of economic decline, as experienced in previous bust periods.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tesg.12153/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacNeill, A C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Amidostomum anseris infection in wild swans and goldeneye ducks.</title><secondary-title>The Canadian Veterinary Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian Veterinary Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Can Vet J</abbr-1></periodical><pages>164-167</pages><volume>11</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1970</year><pub-dates><date>1970-08</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-5286</isbn><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1695093/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1695093/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-23 01:09:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Macdonald, J S</author><author>Beaudry, P G</author><author>MacIsaac, E A</author><author>Herunter, H E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of forest harvesting and best management practices on streamflow and suspended sediment concentrations during snowmelt in headwater streams in sub-boreal forests of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Forest Research</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

During the period from 1976 to 1986, the proportion of anesthetics that were administered by non-certified anesthetists declined from 28.3% to 22.1% of the total number. Small and medium-sized hospitals continue to depend on family-physician anesthetists. Family practitioners make up 96.9% of all anesthetists practising in hospitals with fewer than 50 beds and 88.2% of anesthetists in hospitals with 50-99 beds. Rural areas are served almost exclusively by family-practice anesthetists, since 16 of 29 B.C. regional districts have one or no certified anesthetists.

Topics considered include troubling the urban/rural divide in the context of Indigenous knowledge and expanding to include the common Canadian notion of the “remote”, a designation rooted in our national colonial narrative for the mythic, typically northern, wilderness sparsely inhabited by primarily Indigenous peoples. These concepts are further considered through exploration of Indigenous and allied ecological activism in Canada and the United States related to the proposed Northern Gateway and Keystone XL pipelines. This discussion concludes with an argument for the inherent pedagogical opportunity presented by such cases for contemporary educators to engage students in consideration of wicked problems, geographically rooted cognitive diversity, and the legal, economic, ecological, and cultural underpinnings and ramifications of the current events prominent in their home communities and abroad.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11422-016-9746-4</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-24 22:35:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linning, Shannon J.</author><author>Andresen, Martin A.</author><author>Ghaseminejad, Amir H.</author><author>Brantingham, Paul J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Crime Seasonality across Multiple Jurisdictions in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Criminology and Criminal Justice</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-01-16</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3138/cjccj.2015.E31</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Seasonal changes in crime have been documented since the mid-1800s, but no definitive consensus has been reached regarding universal annual patterns. Researchers also tend to focus on a single city over a particular time period, and, due to methodological differences, studies can often be difficult to compare. As such, this study investigates the seasonal fluctuations of crime across eight cities in British Columbia, Canada, between 2000 and 2006. Uniform Crime Report data, representing four crime types (assault, robbery, motor vehicle theft, and break and enter) were used in negative binomial or Poisson count models and regressed against trend, weather, and illumination variables. Results suggest that temperature changes impacted assault levels, few weather variables affected the occurrence of robberies, and fluctuations in property crime types were variable across the cities. Moreover, rain and snow had a deterrent effect on crime in cities that were not used to such weather conditions.

Resource extractive industries are, however, fixtures in many rural, remote, northern, and Indigenous communities in settler colonial British Columbia, Canada. These industries shape youths' perceived options for social and economic ventures when they are looking towards their futures. By engaging literature on climate change, settler colonialism, and critical Indigenous studies, and drawing on empirics from workshops conducted with youth from northern British Columbia, this paper explores how rural and remote northern and Indigenous youth engagement and perspectives can transform discussions on climate change and resource extraction. The paper documents how rural and northern youth have been engaged in environmental decision making, particularly in light of resource extraction. The paper also suggests that environmental decision making has at times been extractive itself. The paper concludes that when engaged meaningfully, youth desire to work collectively against social and environmental injustices.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Location: northern BC&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/cag.12605</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2022-04-13 13:36:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melnychuk, Natalya</author><author>Loë, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Legitimacy assessment throughout the life of collaborative water governance</title><secondary-title>Environmental Policy and Governance</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Policy and Governance</full-title><abbr-1>Env Pol Gov</abbr-1></periodical><pages>14-28</pages><volume>30</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>3.b.ii Health promotion/education</keyword><keyword>7.b Qualitative</keyword><keyword>20.d Knowledge synthesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1756-932X, 1756-9338</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/eet.1872</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Collaborative governance arrangements involving a diversity of groups (e.g., governments, civil society, industry) are increasingly being used to make decisions or give advice to decision-makers on water issues. Legitimacy is a critical factor for the effectiveness, efficiency, stability, and popular approval of collaborative efforts. However, as a concept, legitimacy remains contested with various meanings, theoretical backgrounds, and source norms. Clarity is particularly needed around the changing sources of legitimacy as collaborative efforts mature. Drawing on case-study research of five collaborations in British Columbia, Canada, we present a framework of legitimacy sources as collaborations evolve. Legitimacy during the establishment of a collaboration depends principally on community readiness to collaborate, a sense of need, and the perceived potential for goal achievement. As a collaboration continues to grow, its legitimacy forms mainly from normative processes—the perceived quality of factors such as accountability, transparency, consensus-building, and representation of relevant discourses. Once a collaboration reaches maturity and faces questions of its future existence, legitimacy is largely result-based—tangible and contextually meaningful outcomes must be easily identifiable and promoted. Increased understanding of the dynamics of legitimacy can help collaborative efforts strategically plan and work toward their goals as they evolve.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Location: Nechako watershed&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/eet.1872</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2022-04-13 13:00:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ouellet-Proulx, Sébastien</author><author>St-Hilaire, André</author><author>Boucher, Marie-Amélie</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Implication of evaporative loss estimation methods in discharge and water temperature modelling in cool temperate climates</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><pages>2867-2884</pages><volume>33</volume><number>22</number><issue>22</issue><keywords><keyword>7.a Quantitative</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>3.b.ii Health promotion/education</keyword><keyword>20.d Knowledge synthesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.13534</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Evaporative flux is a key component of hydrological budgets. Water loss through evapotranspiration reduces volumes available for run-off. The transition from liquid to water vapour on open water surfaces requires heat. Consequently, evaporation act as a cooling mechanism during summer. Both river discharge and water temperature simulations are thus influenced by the methods used to model evaporation. In this paper, the impact of evapotranspiration estimation methods on simulated discharge is assessed using a semidistributed model on two Canadian watersheds. The impact of evaporation estimation methods on water temperature simulations is also evaluated. Finally, the validity of using the same formulation to simulate both of these processes is verified. Five well-known evapotranspiration models and five evaporation models with different wind functions were tested. Results show a large disparity (18–22% of mean annual total evapotranspiration) among the evapotranspiration methods, leading to important differences in simulated discharge (3–25% of observed discharge). Larger differences result from evaporation estimation methods with mean annual divergences of 34–48%. This translates into a difference in mean summer water temperature of 1–15%. Results also show that the choice of model parameter has less influence than the choice of evapotranspiration method in discharge simulations. However, the parameter values influence thermal simulations in the same order of magnitude as the choice of evaporation estimation method. Overall, the results of this study suggest that evapotranspiration and open water evaporation should be represented separately in a hydrological modelling framework, especially when water temperature simulations are required.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Location: Nechako watershed&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hyp.13534</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2022-04-07 13:40:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Souther, J.

An eroded Pleistocene subaerial flow at the base of the pile is overlain by a subglacial mound of hyaloclastite that is, in turn, partly covered by a younger composite pyroclastic cone and associated lava flows. A whole-rock K–Ar date of 0.34 ± 0.03 Ma on the oldest flow is consistent with a hotspot model for the Anahim Belt and implies absolute late Neogene motion of 2.6 cm/year for North America. The hyaloclastite mound was erupted beneath the Cordilleran Ice Sheet during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps during the Fraser Glaciation (25 000 – 10 000 years BP). Radiocarbon dates from peat above and below Nazko tephra in a bog near the cone suggest that the volcano last erupted about 7200 years BP.Nazko basalt has 10–15% normative nepheline and is classified as basanite.

It coincides with a period of general uplift during which the central part of the former eugeosyncline was subjected to tensional stresses resulting in rifting and block faulting accompanied by submissive intrusion of epizonal, acid plutons. Both the plutons and the acid volcanic rocks are considered to be products of the same magma. Periodic escape of gas from the tops of large magma chambers was accompanied by intense shattering of the roof rocks and expulsion of great volumes of gas-charged magma which produced the thick piles of welded tuff and ignimbrite that characterize the early Tertiary Sloko succession.The area underlain by the early Tertiary acid volcanic rocks coincides with that of the Whitehorse-Nechako Trough, a belt of prolonged subsidence in which the greatest thickness of eugeosynclinal sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated through most of Mesozoic time. This fact, plus the predominance of acidic rather than basic lavas and plutons in the early Tertiary of British Columbia, suggests that these rocks originated from primary anatectic magma rather than acid magma derived through differentiation of a more basic parent.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02597666</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:36:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Slaney, T.

We then collected supplementary information by circulating the database among fisheries professionals and interest groups throughout British Columbia and thus identified 9,662 anadromous salmon stocks. These stocks included 866 chinook, 1,625 chum, 2,594 coho, 2,169 pink, 917 sockeye, 867 steelhead and 612 sea-run cutthroat trout stocks. We assessed the status of anadromous stocks by employing a classification scheme similar to that of Nehlsen et al. (1991). Assessments were possible for 5,487 (57%) of all stocks and included all large, commercially important stocks. The assessments found 624 stocks were at high risk, 78 were at moderate risk, 230 were of special concern, and 142 were extirpated in this century. We were unable to classify 4,172 (43%) of the stocks because of an absence of reliable data. Due to their small size, these stocks are not of great commercial importance, although they are important to the maintenance of salmonid diversity. We also identified many potential threats to anadromous salmon stocks. The absence of systematic, high-quality assessments at the biological stock level precluded reliable assignment of the specific causes for many of the stocks apparently at risk. Nevertheless, habitat degradation associated with logging, urbanization, and hydropower development contributed to most of the 142 documented stock extinctions. Furthermore, there is little doubt that overutilization by commercial and recreational fisheries has in many cases resulted in severe stock depressions that, when added to other factors, has put many stocks at risk.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/1548-8446%281996%29021%3C0020%3ASOASAT%3E2.0.CO%3B2</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:21:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sinclair, William F.</author><author>Reid, David J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Conflicts among recreational resource users-the case of non-Canadian participation in the regional sport fisheries of British Columbia and the Yukon</title><secondary-title>The Annals of Regional Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Annals of Regional Science</full-title><abbr-1>Ann Reg Sci</abbr-1></periodical><pages>24-42</pages><volume>8</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1974</year><pub-dates><date>1974-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0570-1864, 1432-0592</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF01295823</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There has been a great deal of controversy recently in British Columbia over the non-Canadian use of the province's recreational resources. Tourism is British Columbia's third largest industry, yet tourist facilities, especially publicly provided facilities, have been experiencing crowding problems, which many believe result in deterioration in the quality of the recreational experience. In July, 1973, British Columbia's Minister of Highways responded to this situation by advocating a ban on all United States' recreational vehicles.In the present paper the problems of recreational resource development are subjected to economic analysis. One group of non-Canadian users, namely, sport fishermen, is singled out for attention. The consequences of various relevant recreation policies are discussed on a regional basis, drawing on a selection of studies undertaken by the Northern Economics Unit, Federal Fisheries Service, in Vancouver.The conclusions of the paper are as follows. It is evident that public attitudes towards non-resident use of locally identified recreational resources vary significantly from one region to another.Overcrowded conditions prevailing in some areas are not evident in others and policies must be flexible enough to take account of regional variation. Furthermore, excess demand is often a reflection of inconsistent government policies which produce a gap between the planned utilisation and the planned provision of facilities. Under such conditions discrimination on the basis of residential status is likely to be carried to lengths beyond those justified by economic analysis. In particular, in the case of British Columbia, to focus attention on restricting non-Canadian use is to divert attention away from the real problem. In the final analysis, if governments are concerned with providing an optimal amount of good quality recreational opportunities and maximising the real net benefits accruing to residents under their jurisdictions, then a policy package more finely attuned to these objectives is necessary.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01295823</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 19:32:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Northcote, T.

More importantly these provincial features intensify problems in predicting the magnitude and sometimes even the direction of such effects. Nevertheless a number of useful models are available to help predict these changes acting through alterations in stream discharge and periodicity, ice-free period, water temperature, epilimnial depth and volume, dissolved oxygen level and hypolomnetic depletion rate, all of which are major determinants of sportfish habitat quality and quantity. Not surprisingly there is great regional difference in the direction and severity of probable effects of global environmental change within the province — in some areas negative and in others positive. These are reviewed and suggestions made regarding management policies required to meet their challenge.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00216405</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:57:13</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nepal, Sanjay K.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indigenous Ecotourism in Central British Columbia: The Potential for Building Capacity in the Tl'azt'en Nations Territories</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ecotourism</secondary-title><short-title>Indigenous Ecotourism in Central British Columbia</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ecotourism</full-title></periodical><pages>173-194</pages><volume>3</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-10-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1472-4049</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14664200508668431</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article explores the potential for building capacity to plan and develop ecotourism in a traditionally forest-dependent indigenous community in central British Columbia (BC), Canada. It is based on fieldwork conducted in 2001 and 2002, consisting mainly of two community workshops, and a survey of 128 Tl'azt'en Nation households. Results show that there is significant potential for ecotourism development in the Tl'azt'en territory. The Tl'azt'en have a strong desire to be involved in ecotourism; however, they are incognisant of the challenges and opportunities that come with its development. There is a general lack of commitment to a shared responsibility in the planning and management of ecotourism. Four potential obstacles to fully realise the development of ecotourism include the speculation that most commercial ‘niches’ are already filled; lack of clearly identified target visitor markets; competing interests from other northern BC communities that have similar resources; and stereotypical images of First Nations in Canada. The article suggests several strategies, including the capitalisation of Tl'azt'enne knowledge of the resources, building networks with other aboriginal and non-aboriginal agencies and individuals, exploring opportunities for educating and training the youth in tourism and small enterprise development, and building partnerships with tour operators.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14664200508668431</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-06-17 22:51:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelsen, Jacqueline</author><author>Scoble, Malcolm</author><author>Ostry, Aleck</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sustainable socio-economic development in mining communities: north-central British Columbia perspectives</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Mining, Reclamation and Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>163-179</pages><volume>24</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The recent global commodities price boom prompted a significant growth in mineral exploration projects in British Columbia (BC). These now face the impacts of the recession in the global economy. The forests in BC where many of these projects are underway is also facing a massive, climate-change related, pine beetle infestation which along with the housing slowdown in North America is causing a collapse of the region’s forestry industry. Mining development could create new jobs through economic development, reducing the exodus of skilled workers and nurturing the already fragile state of many rural communities, including First Nations. Recent issues over new BC mining projects and their impacts on surrounding communities prompt consideration of an approach to project planning that goes beyond simply aiming to mitigate environmental and social impacts. The opportunity exists to involve the participation of communities early in the planning process and to place greater consideration on the contribution of a project to building social capital in these mining communities. There is also the possibility to consider the role of a particular project in a more strategic sense, as part of regional development planning that deals with wider issues, time spans and synergies relating to socio-economic development in mining communities. This article stems from early research into the characterisa- tion of social capital and the use of community-indicators to forecast specific social and economic outcomes for new mining projects. The overall objective is to evaluate an approach to mine planning that potentially takes greater account of opportunities to enhance community health and resilience. Reference is made to a current mining project in north-central BC, characteristic of the complex socio- economic setting of contemporary mining developments in BC.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Vanderhoof</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17480930903185107</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Neilson, John D.</author><author>Banford, Christine E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) spawner characteristics in relation to redd physical features</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Zoology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Zoology</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

Les premiers reproducteurs arrivés pondent leurs œufs dans des nids plus grands, construits en eau plus profonde et à courant plus lent. Les nids des poissons qui arrivent plus tard sont en moyenne plus petits et sont construits en eau relativement peu profonde à courant rapide; ces poissons occupent en moyenne leurs nids moins longtemps que les premiers arrivants.

Information exists on the microhabitat characteristics that define suitable salmon spawning habitat. However, traditional spawning habitat models that use these characteristics to predict available spawning habitat are restricted because they can not account for the heterogeneous nature of rivers. We present a conceptual spawning habitat model for fall chinook salmon that describes how geomorphic features of river channels create hydraulic processes, including hyporheic flows, that influence where salmon spawn in unconstrained reaches of large mainstem alluvial rivers. Two case studies based on empirical data from fall chinook salmon spawning areas in the Hanford Reach of the Columbia River are presented to illustrate important aspects of our conceptual model. We suggest that traditional habitat models and our conceptual model be combined to predict the limits of suitable fall chinook salmon spawning habitat. This approach can incorporate quantitative measures of river channel morphology, including general descriptors of geomorphic features at different spatial scales, in order to understand the processes influencing redd site selection and spawning habitat use. This information is needed in order to protect existing salmon spawning habitat in large rivers, as well as to recover habitat already lost.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s002679900137</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 19:33:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gaudreau, Kyrke</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Angling for success: wayne Salewski Is Earth Day Canada's Hometown Hero</title><secondary-title>Alternatives Journal</secondary-title><short-title>Angling for success</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Alternatives Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>60-61</pages><volume>40</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>12057398</isbn><remote-database-name>go.galegroup.com</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;issn=12057398&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA397094590&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;linkaccess=abs</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-17 15:39:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fiske, Jo-Anne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pocahontas's Granddaughters: Spiritual Transition and Tradition of Carrier Women of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Ethnohistory</secondary-title><short-title>Pocahontas's Granddaughters</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ethnohistory</full-title></periodical><pages>663-681</pages><volume>43</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0014-1801</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/483250</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Spirituality and sexuality marked moral boundaries on the North American colonial frontier. Images of women's bodies and presumptions about female morality were central signifiers of relative stages of "civilization." Images created in the seventeenth century endure and persist in dividing aboriginal womanhood into the dichotomous and harmful categories of "princess" and "squaw." The continuing appeal of Pocahontas myths reveals the power of these images to affect contemporary understandings of morality and gender. This article considers the contemporary implications of frontier constructs of female sexuality and spirituality. If colonial and postcolonial relations are conceptualized as an enduring "im/moral" frontier, issues of spirituality and sexuality can be understood as complex negotiations of meaning that reflect changing power relations. Contemporary aboriginal women, metaphorical granddaughters of Pocahontas, confront their spiritual transformations in diverse ways. In central British Columbia they have done so alongside the move to beatify a former student of a residential school.</abstract><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/483250</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-29 22:04:57</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fabre, Cara</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>“There’s a treatment centre where the residential school used to be”: Alcoholism, Acculturation, and Barriers to Indigenous Health in Eden Robinson’s Monkey Beach</title><secondary-title>Studies in Canadian Literature / Études en littérature canadienne</secondary-title><short-title>“There’s a treatment centre where the residential school used to be”</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Studies in Canadian Literature / Études en littérature canadienne</full-title></periodical><volume>38</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1718-7850</isbn><abstract>The Drunken Indian stereotype has a long history of expression across literary, scientific, sociological, and political discourses. This article traces the persistence and operative nature of its production and reproduction and argues that Eden Robinson's Monkey Beach challenges the stereotype through refiguring addiction as social suffering rather than individual — and racialized — pathology. By employing cartographic imagery, generational juxtaposition, and a first-person dual point of view that negotiates between spectral and spiritless worlds, Monkey Beach contextualizes habitual drinking as a response to alienation from cultural practices that are becoming increasingly threatened by ongoing colonial and capitalist policies of individualism and acculturation. The Haisla characters contend with the affective consequences of living in what Karl Marx calls a “coerced” and “forced labor” economy. Yet, because the forced transition to this mode of production is a relatively recent process within Indigenous histories — one that is violently and insidiously imposed, rather than always already installed — it has not become fully naturalized. Consequently, Robinson depicts addiction as engendered not only by historical trauma emergent from the dismantling of Indigenous lifeways connecting kinship, land, and spirituality, but also by the ideological and material conditions of capital. Ultimately, Robinson's novel betrays how the material conditions of late capitalism exacerbate colonial trauma, which manifests as social suffering, and extend colonialism’s acculturative shadow. As such, Monkey Beach re-signifies addiction as exposing the limits of full participation in a colonial and capitalist economy, precisely because of the cultural, economic, and spiritual violence on which such systems are predicated.</abstract><remote-database-name>journals.lib.unb.ca</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/SCL/article/view/22062</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Everitt, Robert R.</author><author>Sonntag, Nicholas C.</author><author>Puterman, Martin L.</author><author>Whalen, Patrick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Mathematical Programming Model for the Management of a Renewable Resource System: The Kemano II Development Project</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada</secondary-title><short-title>A Mathematical Programming Model for the Management of a Renewable Resource System</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada</full-title><abbr-1>J.

Management objectives are specified as bounds and desirable target levels for certain important variables. The mathematical program consists of minimizing the deviation from these targets subject to natural and policy constraints. A detailed application studying the effect of the proposed Kemano II development project on the salmon fisheries of northwestern British Columbia is presented. Parametric programming is used to compare several development scenarios on the basis of the sensitivity of the system to reduce runoff in a specified year.

L'établissement de limites et de niveaux désirables pour certaines variables importantes est considéré comme un objectif spécifique de la gestion. Le programme mathématique consiste à réduire au minimum l'écart entre cibles et variables, compte tenu des contraintes naturelles et politiques.

However, the Skeena Fold Belt, which spans most of the width of the northern Intermontane Belt, exhibits shortening comparable with that in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. The Skeena Fold Belt has many features of thin-skinned fold and thrust belts, such as thrust faults which sole into a detachment, a wide variety of structural styles which depend on rock type, a foreland basin which was cannibalized by continued deformation, a frontal triangle zone, and a hinterland of metamorphic and plutonic rocks (Coast Plutonic Complex). The Skeena Fold Belt thus is comparable with the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt, but rather than deforming a continental terrace wedge, it developed in a terrane (Stikinia) which had accreted to North America in the early Mesozoic, and in Jurassic and Cretaceous clastic successions (Bowser Lake and Sustut groups) which overlie Stikinia. Structural and stratigraphic relationships show that the earliest deformation occurred between Oxfordian and Albian time and that the last folds developed in latest Cretaceous or early Tertiary time. As much as 160 km of northeastward shortening in the Skeena Fold Belt was broadly contemporaneous with crustal thickening in the Coast Plutonic Complex and Omineca Belt, with dextral strike-slip faulting east of the Skeena Fold Belt, and with shortening in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. Therefore, between latest Jurassic and early Tertiary times, horizontal shortening occured across most of the width of the northern Canadian Cordillera. Concurrent shortening across the Cordillera suggests that a common detachment (or detachments) fed all of these zones as far east as the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/90TC02680/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:20:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Evans, Mike</author><author>McDonald, James</author><author>Nyce, Deanna</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Acting across boundaries in Aboriginal curriculum development: Examples from Northern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Native Education</secondary-title><short-title>Acting across boundaries in Aboriginal curriculum development</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Native Education</full-title></periodical><pages>190-205</pages><volume>23</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>education</keyword><keyword>Ethnic Interests</keyword><keyword>Native American Studies</keyword><keyword>Colleges &amp; universities</keyword><keyword>Curriculum development</keyword><keyword>Native education</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>07101481</isbn><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/230306376/citation/C8C8C8B91320424APQ/1</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:54:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eliason, E.

Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jfb.12790/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-05-08 02:54:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bunch, Martin J.</author><author>Parkes, Margot</author><author>Zubrycki, Karla</author><author>Venema, Henry</author><author>Hallstrom, Lars</author><author>Neudorffer, Cynthia</author><author>Berbés-Blázquez, Marta</author><author>Morrison, Karen</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Watershed Management and Public Health: An Exploration of the Intersection of Two Fields as Reported in the Literature from 2000 to 2010</title><secondary-title>Environmental Management</secondary-title><short-title>Watershed Management and Public Health</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Management</full-title><abbr-1>Environmental Management</abbr-1></periodical><pages>240-254</pages><volume>54</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-08-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0364-152X, 1432-1009</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00267-014-0301-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Watersheds are settings for health and well-being that have a great deal to offer the public health community due to the correspondence between the spatial form of the watershed unit and the importance to health and well-being of water. However, managing watersheds for human health and well-being requires the ability to move beyond typical reductionist approaches toward more holistic methods. Health and well-being are emergent properties of inter-related social and biophysical processes. This paper characterizes points of connection and integration between watershed management and public health and tests a new conceptual model, the Watershed Governance Prism, to determine the prevalence in peer-reviewed literature of different perspectives relating to watersheds and public health. We conducted an initial search of academic databases for papers that addressed the interface between watershed management (or governance) and public health themes. We then generated a sample of these papers and undertook a collaborative analysis informed by the Watershed Governance Prism. Our analysis found that although these manuscripts dealt with a range of biophysical and social determinants of health, there was a tendency for social factors and health outcomes to be framed as context only for these studies, rather than form the core of the relationships being investigated. At least one cluster of papers emerged from this analysis that represented a cohesive perspective on watershed governance and health; “Perspective B” on the Watershed Governance Prism, “water governance for ecosystems and well-being,” was dominant. Overall, the integration of watershed management/governance and public health is in its infancy.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00267-014-0301-3</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-08-14 16:36:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boon, Sarah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Snow accumulation and ablation in a beetle-killed pine stand in Northern Interior British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ecosystems and Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ecosystems and Management</full-title></periodical><volume>8</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Mountain Pine Beetle</keyword><keyword>ablation</keyword><keyword>accumulation</keyword><keyword>energy balance</keyword><keyword>forest canopy</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007-12-17</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>This preliminary study examined the impact of mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation and subsequent canopy mortality on ground snow accumulation and ablation in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands. During the winter of 2005–2006, meteorological and snow conditions were measured in three stands—dead, alive, and cleared—in Northern Interior British Columbia. Variations in measured snow conditions and meteorological data between stands were assessed. Data were used in an energy-balance model to calculate snow ablation in each stand and estimate effects on meltwater production. Results showed that the dead stand no longer behaved like an alive stand, but had not yet approached cleared stand conditions. Ablation rates in the dead stand remained similar to those in the alive stand, although accumulation was closer to that in the cleared stand. The combination of a low ablation rate and increased ground snow accumulation in the dead stand resulted in a lengthened period of snowpack disappearance. In the cleared stand, however, high ablation rates were sufficient to remove the thicker snowpack earlier than in the dead stand. A multi-year study is under way at a new research site to further quantify the relationship between beetle-kill and its effect on snowpack.</abstract><remote-database-name>jem-online.org</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://jem-online.org/forrex/index.php/jem/article/view/369</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-23 01:10:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christie, Gordon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indigenous Authority, Canadian Law, and Pipeline Proposals</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Law and Practice; Scarborough</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Law and Practice; Scarborough</full-title></periodical><pages>189-215</pages><volume>25</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Native North Americans</keyword><keyword>Environmental Studies</keyword><keyword>Law</keyword><keyword>Environmental protection</keyword><keyword>Studies</keyword><keyword>Authority</keyword><keyword>PIPELINES</keyword><keyword>Nahleh Whut'en</keyword><keyword>Nak'azdli</keyword><keyword>Saik'uz</keyword><keyword>Wet'suwet'en and TTazt'en</keyword><keyword>Yinka Dene Alliance is made up of six First Nations - the Takla Lake</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>11817534</isbn><abstract>The Yinka Dene Alliance is a coalition of six First Nations in British Columbia. This Alliance has engaged a form of resistance to the proposed Northern Gateway pipeline articulated in such manifestos as the Save the Fraser Declaration. This Declaration (endorsed by over 130 First Nations in western Canada) brings to the fore the authority of the nations of the Yinka Dene Alliance, authority possessed as Indigenous nations and expressed in the form of pronouncements about what they consider to be against their Indigenous laws. The middle sections of this paper contain an exploration into how the Indigenous authority grounding these expressions of Indigenous law would likely be treated by Canadian law. The intent is to show just how antagonistic the Canadian legal apparatus is to such forms of resistance. Illustration of the depth and nature of the hostility leads into questions about why this might be so. Reflections on what seems to fuel an absolute denial of Indigenous authority show not only how challenging it will be to make headway but also the great promise held out by resistance founded on such authority. This promise is not only for Aboriginal peoples in Canada (as they struggle to protect their lands and cultures), but for citizens of the world in search of grounds of authority that might stand up in the face of powerful forces seemingly intent on short-term wealth maximization based on unsustainable resource exploitation.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/docview/1668005740/abstract/21947444EA7C4601PQ/1</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25 21:35:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Christensen, Bev</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Too good to be true: Alcan's Kemano completion project // Review</title><secondary-title>Alternatives Journal</secondary-title><short-title>Too good to be true</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Alternatives Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>30-31</pages><volume>22</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Environmental aspects</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Environmental Studies</keyword><keyword>Book reviews</keyword><keyword>Hydroelectric plants</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>12057398</isbn><abstract>The Nechako River originally drained a network of spectacular wilderness streams and lakes. Few knew this area, other than the Cheslatta T'en First Nations community and some tourists, farmers and ranchers. Alcan arrived in 1950, lured by the promise of cheap electricity (required in vast quantities for aluminum smelting) and provincial subsidies. In return for Alcan's investment in a dam, power plant and smelter, the Industrial Development Act of 1949 provided tax exemptions, considerable autonomy, and control over much of the forests and waters of the region. In 1979 Alcan announced plans to expand electrical production at Kemano. A 1987 agreement, negotiated secretly with the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans, gave it permission to divert more of the Nechako, reducing its flow to about 12 percent of the pre - 1950 amount. The agreement also contained conditions intended to ensure protection of salmon stocks. But even as Alcan began construction in 1988, opposition was increasing among residents of the Nechako Valley, led by the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and the Rivers Defense Coalition. Eventually, this opposition spread throughout the province, and captured considerable media attention. The controversy culminated in a public review by the BC Utilities Commission, and subsequently, [Mike Harcourt]'s announcement in January 1995.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/cbcacurrent/docview/218767007/abstract/64809FD44D6649FDPQ/79?</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-10 21:12:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ching, Hilda Lei</author><author>Andersen, Karin</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Description of Εubothrium tulipai sp. n.

Six antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains belonging to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas were used as inocula. For controlled environment assays, surface sterilized seeds were inoculated with log 6 Bacillus or log 8 Pseudomonas colony-forming units (cfu) under gnotobiotic conditions for assessment of rhizosphere and internal root and stem tissue colonization. In the field trial, one-year-old, container-grown hybrid spruce seedlings were inoculated with each of the Bacillus or Pseudomonas strains 1–2 days before planting at nine field sites in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. All six strains colonized the rhizosphere with log 5.6−7.6 cfu g−1 root tissue under controlled environmental conditions. Two strains, Bacillus Pw-2R and Pseudomonas Sm3-RN, were also recovered from internal root and stem tissues with population sizes ranging from log 3.9 to log 5.0 cfu g−1 plant tissue. In the field trial, PGPR survived the winter in the rhizosphere with populations of log 2 to log 5 cfu g−1 root tissue 17 months after inoculation. In addition, spruce growth was significantly enhanced by bacterial inoculation at certain sites. The most effective growth-promoting strains were the endophytes, Sm3-RN and Pw2-R, and the external root colonizing strain, Ss2-RN. These three strains increased seedling dry weight up to 57% above noninoculated controls at five of the nine outplanting sites. Pseudomonas strain Sw1 and the other two Bacillus strains produced mean spruce dry weight increases at four of the sites. Seedling growth inhibition due to bacterial inoculation was detected at some sites. Our results confirm the short-term, site specific effectiveness of PGPR for reforestation of conifer seedlings, and indicate that benefits of a single inoculation at planting can extend through the second year in the field. In addition, bacteria capable of colonizing the seedling interior may be more effective PGPR for spruce than those restricted to the rhizosphere and the root surface. However, site specific seedling growth promotion may necessitate matching PGPR strains to outplanting sites for effective growth promotion.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811279900300X</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 22:28:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Budhwa, Rick</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An Alternate Model for First Nations Involvement in Resource Management Archaeology</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Archaeology / Journal Canadien d’Archéologie</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Archaeology / Journal Canadien d’Archéologie</full-title></periodical><pages>20-45</pages><volume>29</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0705-2006</isbn><abstract>The Wet'suwet'en are currently struggling to affirm their Aboriginal and territorial rights through the British Columbia treaty process. While this process continues, resource extraction activities remove large volumes of culturally important resources. At present, very few areas of the their territory have not been impacted by logging or mining development. Understandably, the Wet'suwet'en feel a sense of urgency regarding the conservation and protection of their natural and cultural resources. This paper examines how the Wet'suwet'en adapted the existing archaeological process within the resource management industry to better reflect their vision and cultural values. The creation of non-legislated policy and protocol agreements with various industry and government entities, combined with the Wet'suwet'en Territorial Stewardship Plan (WTSP), has allowed this First Nation to centrally position themselves in the archaeological process, which did not adequately address their needs. The primary result has been greater Wet'suwet'en involvement in decisions made regarding the management of their cultural resources.</abstract><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/41103515</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-27 19:30:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brown, Doug</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carrier Sekani self-government in context: land and resources</title><secondary-title>Western Geography</secondary-title><short-title>Carrier Sekani self-government in context</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Western Geography</full-title></periodical><pages>21-67</pages><volume>12</volume><number>2002</number><issue>2002</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Since the mid-19th century Carrier Sekani nations have been  undergoing  changes  that  have  weakened,  but  not destroyed,  the  basis  for  self-government.

All models that received support using Akaike’s information criterion included stream characteristics that are associated with cover. These included the percent area of pools, percentage of the banks that were undercut, and large woody debris (in that order). These results suggest the importance of stream characteristics, which reduce risk of predation on adults, in determining spawning sockeye salmon densities.

All but one were built between 1950 and 1985; a period when environmental considerations for large projects were evolving to present-day social, political and regulatory standards. Large projects result in ecosystem transformations; river valleys are converted to reservoirs, and the release of water for power generation results in highly altered flow regimes downstream of dams. I describe the effects of three projects on aquatic ecosystems and measures that have been taken over the past 60 years to monitor and mitigate those effects, with an emphasis on downstream effects to fish populations. I briefly review methods that were used to predict effects, particularly on key fish species, and consider the role of adaptive management and its alternatives on resolving uncertainties about ecological effects of large hydroelectric projects.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Location: the Kenney Dam (53.579316670846914, -124.94999463732606)&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10750-020-04362-3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradford, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends in the abundance of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Nechako River, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>965-973</pages><volume>51</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/f94-096</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-06-06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradford, M J</author><author>Taylor, G C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Individual variation in dispersal behaviour of newly emerged chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the Upper Fraser River, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

We tested the hypothesis that this range in dispersal distances is caused by innate differences in nocturnal migratory tendency among individuals. Using an experimental stream channel, we found repeatable differences in downstream movement behaviour among newly emerged chinook fry. Fish that moved downstream were larger than those that held position in the channel. However, the incidence of downstream movement behaviours decreased over the first 2 weeks after emergence. We propose that the variation among individuals in downstream movement behaviour we observed leads to the dispersal of newly emerged fry throughout all available rearing habitats.

Nous avons vérifié l'hypothèse que cette gamme de distances de dispersion soit attribuable à des différences innées dans les tendances migratoires nocturnes chez les individus. En utilisant un chenal de cours d'eau expérimental, nous avons observé des différences répétées dans le comportement de déplacement en aval chez les alevins de saumon chinook nouvellement émergés.

However, adaptation is being increasingly recognized as a necessary action to respond to changes in the climate as societies concurrently mitigate to minimize future anthropogenic climatic forcing. Environmental planners will play a leading role in assisting communities as they face the challenge of preparing for a changing and uncertain future. This research uses a self-assessment survey and workshop to provide a perspective of planner knowledge of climate change adaptation. It also explores climate impacts in communities across the province of British Columbia, Canada, and barriers to effective adaptation. The results indicate that planners do not have a high level of knowledge regarding climate change adaptation. The top impacts that planners believe will affect British Columbia are related to forests, agriculture and river flooding. Planners want adaptation incorporated into existing documents (such as community, regional and provincial plans) rather than separate adaptation plans. The findings of this study demonstrate the need to promote capacity building related to climate change adaptation among planners.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Prince George</research-notes><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/1523908X.2012.659847</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-27 17:45:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Curry, C L</author><author>Islam, S U</author><author>Zwiers, F W</author><author>Déry, S J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Atmospheric Rivers Increase Future Flood Risk in Western Canada's Largest Pacific River</title><secondary-title>Geophysical Research Letters</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geophysical Research Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1651-1661</pages><volume>46</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>7.a Quantitative</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>3.b.ii Health promotion/education</keyword><keyword>20.d Knowledge synthesis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2018GL080720</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Snow‐dominated watersheds are bellwethers of climate change. Hydroclimate projections in such basins often ﬁnd reductions in annual peak runoff due to decreased snowpack under global warming. British Columbia's Fraser River Basin (FRB) is a large, nival basin with exposure to moisture‐laden atmospheric rivers originating in the Paciﬁc Ocean. Landfalling atmospheric rivers over the region in winter are projected to increase in both strength and frequency in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models. We investigate future changes in hydrology and annual peak daily streamﬂow in the FRB using a hydrologic model driven by a bias‐corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (8.5), the FRB evolves toward a nival‐pluvial regime featuring an increasing association of extreme rainfall with annual peak daily ﬂow, a doubling in cold season peak discharge, and a decrease in the return period of the largest historical ﬂow, from a 1‐in‐200‐year to 1‐in‐50‐year event by the late 21st century. Plain Language Summary: Snow‐covered areas of the globe are particularly sensitive to global warming. Future projections using global climate models generally show that as the ratio of snow to rain declines, river ﬂows peak earlier in the year with reduced volume. These models also capture the phenomenon of “atmospheric rivers”: long, meandering plumes of water vapor often originating over the tropical oceans that bring sustained, heavy precipitation to the west coasts of North America and northern Europe. The present‐day frequency of landfalling atmospheric rivers on the Canadian west coast is projected to increase nearly fourfold by the late 21st century, with a proportionate increase in extreme rainfall events. Our work is the ﬁrst to directly investigate the impact of these “rivers in the sky” on “rivers on the land” using climate model projections. Focusing on the Fraser River Basin, Canada's largest Paciﬁc watershed, and using a business‐as‐usual industrial emissions scenario, we show that the basin transitions from one where peak ﬂow results from spring snowmelt to one where peak ﬂow is often caused by extreme rainfall. Our modeling suggests that extreme rainfall events resulting from atmospheric rivers may lead to peak annual ﬂoods of historic proportions, and of unprecedented frequency, by the late 21st century in the Fraser River Basin.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;Location: Research focused on the Fraser River Basin.

The Fraser River is the largest Canadian waterway flowing to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the world’s greatest salmon rivers. Our analyses reveal high runoff rates and low interannual variability in alpine and coastal rivers, and low runoff rates and high interannual variability in most streams in BC’s interior. The interannual variability in streamflow is also low in rivers such as the Adams, Chilko, Quesnel and Stuart where the principal salmon runs of the Fraser River occur. A trend analysis shows a spatially coherent signal with increasing interannual variability in streamflow across the FRB in recent decades, most notably in spring and summer. The upward trend in the coefficient of variation in annual runoff coincides with a period of near-normal annual runoff for the Fraser River at Hope. The interannual variability in streamflow is greater in regulated rather than natural systems; however, it is unclear whether it is predominantly flow regulation that leads to these observed differences. Environmental changes such as rising air temperatures, more frequent polarity changes in large-scale climate teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and retreating glaciers may be contributing to the greater range in annual runoff fluctuations across the FRB. This has implications for ecological processes throughout the basin, for example affecting migrating and spawning salmon, a keystone species vital to First Nations communities as well as to commercial and recreational fisheries. To exemplify this linkage between variable flows and biological responses, the unusual FRB runoff anomalies observed in 2010 are discussed in the context of that year’s sockeye salmon run. As the climate continues to warm, greater variability in annual streamflow, and hence in hydrological extremes, may influence ecological processes and human usage throughout the FRB in the 21st century.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Stuart River</research-notes><remote-database-name>Institute of Physics</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/7/2/024019</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-07-03 17:30:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rex, John</author><author>Dubé, Stephane</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting the risk of wet ground areas in the Vanderhoof Forest District: Project description and progress report</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ecosystems and Management</secondary-title><short-title>Predicting the risk of wet ground areas in the Vanderhoof Forest District</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ecosystems and Management</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>risk assessment</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Mountain Pine Beetle</keyword><keyword>risk indicators</keyword><keyword>soil hydrology</keyword><keyword>water balance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-07-13</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The mountain pine beetle epidemic is changing British Columbia forests and watersheds at the landscape scale. Watersheds with dead-pine-leading stands in the Vanderhoof Forest District of central British Columbia are reported to have wet soils due to raised water tables. They report a conversion of summer logging ground (dry firm soil) to winter logging ground (wetter less firm soil), upon which forestry equipment operation is difficult or impossible before freeze-up. This paper outlines a project that explores this serious operational issue through the perspective of the hydrologic water balance. It aims to determine the spatial extent of wet ground areas and to provide operational guidance through the development of a model that can predict where wet ground may occur at the stand and watershed level. The watershed-level prediction described here will be based on risk indicators developed from available geographic information system data and aerial photographs, as well as local knowledge. Predictions will be qualified through field verification studies at representative stands within ranked watersheds.

Included in winter diets are various species of conifers, some of which are important forestry and ornamental crop trees. Diet choices and feeding habits of mule deer utilizing conifer crops, however, have not been widely reported. Here, we document diet choices made by human-habituated mule deer from north central British Columbia during an exploratory cafeteria-style feeding trial using boughs of thirteen species of native North American and introduced European conifers. Mule deer consumed more biomass from exotic conifers (specifically pine) than from rarely encountered native conifers, and consumed the least biomass from those native conifers commonly encountered by deer in northern BC, a finding which appears to lend support to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis. From most to least biomass consumed, deer selected Mugho pine, Scots pine, western hemlock, subalpine fir, Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Ponderosa pine, western white pine, lodgepole pine, common juniper, red cedar, black spruce, and hybrid white spruce. Analysis of Variance testing suggested that deer preferred to eat exotic Mugho and Scots pine and avoided eating commonly encountered, native black and hybrid white spruce. A relationship also existed between the biomass consumed and the number of bites taken by deer from each species, which generally indicated that deer took more bites from exotic and rarely encountered conifers, but not always. Our results suggest that northern mule deer, therefore, may be more likely to damage introduced pine and other exotics relative to native species planted in either ornamental or forest plantation settings when deer densities are high and/or browse resources are limited.</abstract><remote-database-name>bioone.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.3955/046.091.0110</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-03-06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Poff, Deborah C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Importance of Story-Telling: Research Protocols in Aboriginal Communities</title><secondary-title>Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics</secondary-title><short-title>The Importance of Story-Telling</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics</abbr-1></periodical><pages>27-28</pages><volume>1</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>First Nations</keyword><keyword>aboriginal</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>oral tradition</keyword><keyword>benefit</keyword><keyword>community consultation</keyword><keyword>harm</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1556-2646, 1556-2654</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/jer.2006.1.3.27</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An oral tradition and story telling culture are still central to aboriginal personal and community identity, and provide major means of remembering and conveying personal and community experience with university researchers.

The development of new operations, however, raises concerns around the impacts of mining activities on the environment, health and traditional ways of life of Indigenous peoples. Using the proposed expansion of the Kemess mine in northern British Columbia as a case study, this paper examines two First Nations’ perspectives regarding the regulatory process through which environmental values may be validated and protected, and seeks to understand how these First Nations’ environmental values and perceptions of risk are connected to health and well-being. Sixteen key informant interviews were carried out and thematically analyzed through political ecology and environmental justice frameworks. The paper argues that accommodating First Nations’ environmental values and perceptions of risks is a necessary first step to reclaim health and well-being in politically marginalized settings.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-009-9286-5</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-29 22:23:36</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Peterman, Randall M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamics of Native Indian Food Fisheries on Salmon in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

Although the growth of juvenile Chinook Salmon has been well studied, research has focused on a single population, a narrow range of fish sizes, or a narrow range of temperatures. Therefore, we incorporated the Ratkowsky model for temperature-dependent growth into an allometric growth model; this model was then fitted to growth data from 11 data sources representing nine populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon. The model fit the growth data well, explaining 98% of the variation in final mass. The estimated allometric mass exponent (b) was 0.338 (SE = 0.025), similar to estimates reported for other salmonids. This estimate of b will be particularly useful for estimating mass-standardized growth rates of juvenile Chinook Salmon. In addition, the lower thermal limit, optimal temperature, and upper thermal limit for growth were estimated to be 1.8°C (SE = 0.63°C), 19.0°C (SE = 0.27°C), and 24.9°C (SE = 0.02°C), respectively. By taking a meta-analytical approach, we were able to provide a growth model that is applicable across populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon receiving an ad libitum ration of a pelleted diet.Received May 20, 2014; accepted December 4, 2014</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00028487.2014.996667</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-16 23:19:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parkes, Margot W.</author><author>Allison, Sandra</author><author>Harder, Henry G.</author><author>Hoogeveen, Dawn</author><author>Kutzner, Diana</author><author>Aalhus, Melissa</author><author>Adams, Evan</author><author>Beck, Lindsay</author><author>Brisbois, Ben</author><author>Buse, Chris G.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Addressing the environmental, community, and health impacts of resource development: Challenges across scales, sectors, and sites</title><secondary-title>Challenges</secondary-title><short-title>Addressing the environmental, community, and health impacts of resource development</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Challenges</full-title></periodical><pages>22</pages><volume>10</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>e Leeuw, Sarah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Writing as righting: Truth and reconciliation, poetics, and new geo-graphing in colonial Canada</title><secondary-title>The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien</secondary-title><short-title>Writing as righting</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien</full-title></periodical><pages>306-318</pages><volume>61</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>feminist anti-racist indigenous geographies</keyword><keyword>géographies autochtones antiracistes féministes</keyword><keyword>geohumanities</keyword><keyword>poésie</keyword><keyword>poetry</keyword><keyword>sciences humaines de la géographie</keyword><keyword>truth and reconciliation</keyword><keyword>vérité et réconciliation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12395</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper is anchored in two recent and concurrent openings, openings that offer opportunities for geographers to consider new modes of engaging colonial violence. The first opening is the release, in Canada, of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's final report and calls to action. By demanding new types of settler-subject attention to Indigenous peoples and places, it opens new spaces for extending reflection about anti-Indigenous racism and colonial violence in Canadian consciousness. The second opening is geography's growing uptake of creative and humanities-informed theories and practices. These manifest in new knowledges and practices with consequent possibilities for addressing colonial violence. I consider these two openings first by proposing changes to conversations about settler-normalized violences lived by Indigenous peoples, and, second by engaging poets working to radically re/configure language and written expression. Specifically, the paper ends with a call for geographers—particularly non-Indigenous settler geographers—to rethink ways (and forms) by which we produce knowledge, especially about colonialism and Indigenous geographies and especially in and through writing practices. The paper is experimental in form, meant to disrupt easy uptake or digestion of ideas that must remain—for settler subjects—fundamentally ragged, upsetting, and always beyond conclusion, coherence, or closure.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cag.12395/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:05:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Leeuw</author><author>Sarah de</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>‘If anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young’: colonial constructions of Aboriginal children and the geographies of Indian residential schooling in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Children's Geographies</secondary-title><short-title>‘If anything is to be done with the Indian, we must catch him very young’</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Children's Geographies</full-title></periodical><pages>123-140</pages><volume>7</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal children</keyword><keyword>colonialism</keyword><keyword>school-spaces</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-05-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1473-3285</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14733280902798837</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Although not fully conceptualized as such by geographers, children and concepts of childhood were focal points of colonialism. Well into the twentieth century, Aboriginal peoples in Canada were discursively constructed by colonists as child-like subjects in need of colonial intervention in order that they ‘grow up’ into de-Indigenized Canadian citizens. Further, an important aspect of the colonial project entailed confining Aboriginal children in institutions known as Indian Residential Schools wherein, through material and curricular means, efforts were made to transform the children and dispossess them of socio-cultural identities. Much of the literature on children's geographies contemplates the socially constructed nature of childhood and critiques the pervasive (yet under-evaluated) understanding that childhood is a clear and demarcatable state of being prior to adulthood. Little attention, though, has been paid to historic or social discourses that relegated groups of people to a perpetual state of truncated childhood while simultaneously removing their children in order that those children mature into adults who embodied radically different cultural traits than their ancestors. This paper explores how Aboriginal peoples were doubly confined; firstly, by colonial constructions about children, childhood, and Othered (Aboriginal) peoples and then, secondly, within the material geographies of colonial residential schools.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14733280902798837</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-04-17 19:08:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dalton, Anthony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Whitewater Devils: Adventure on Wild Waters</title><secondary-title>BC Studies</secondary-title><short-title>Whitewater Devils</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BC Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>160</pages><number>173</number><issue>173</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>General Interest Periodicals--Canada</keyword><keyword>Humanities: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>RIVERS</keyword><keyword>Books</keyword><keyword>Canoes &amp; canoeing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00052949</isbn><abstract>Boudreau launches his readers into the white water of the book's title with his memories of barrel races on the Fraser River near Prince George, canoe races on the Nechako and Stuart rivers, and others.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/cbcacurrent/docview/1021199756/abstract/64809FD44D6649FDPQ/256?</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-10 21:31:36</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Curry, John</author><author>Mynen, Tonianne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrating sustainability concepts and First Nations values in an urban neighbourhood: a case study of Carney Hill neighbourhood, Prince George, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Sustainable Society</secondary-title><short-title>Integrating sustainability concepts and First Nations values in an urban neighbourhood</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Sustainable Society</full-title><abbr-1>International Journal of Sustainable Society</abbr-1></periodical><pages>26-49</pages><volume>2</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-12-22</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1756-2538</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1504/IJSSoc.2010.030561</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In 2002, the Carney Hill neighbourhood in Prince George, British Columbia, was identified as the highest risk neighbourhood in the province for healthy child development. This paper describes the community development efforts underway since 1992 to create a positive healthy neighbourhood for residents of all ages. A review of literature explores First Nations traditional value and belief structures, the concept of integrative planning, theories of social learning and principles of community sustainability. Concepts of social capital are reviewed and the concept of sustainability capital is introduced. A case study approach is used to explore the community development process, identify positive and negative elements within the neighbourhood and to suggest methods and activities to aid in the facilitation of positive changes within the neighbourhood. Finally, ideas to integrate First Nations values and beliefs and relevant concepts of environmental sustainability within the development process are discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>inderscienceonline.com (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJSSOC.2010.030561</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25 21:28:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Craig, J.

Anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn sympatrically and interbreed, yet allele frequency differences at neutral loci indicate restricted gene flow. Disruptive natural selection associated with strong selective differences between anadromous and nonanadromous life histories is thought to maintain the genetic differentiation of the morphs. Recently, a putative third morph of O. nerka exhibiting green rather than red breeding colour has been found on the spawning grounds sympatric with sockeye and kokanee. We investigated the ancestry of these green fish in a 2-year controlled breeding study by using previously documented heritable, countergradient variation in red breeding colour to distinguish pure and hybrid morphs. Stabilizing sexual selection for similar red breeding colour in sockeye and kokanee has led to adaptive differences in the efficiency of carotenoid uptake between the morphs given differences in carotenoid availability between marine and lacustrine habitats. On the same diet, offspring parented by the green fish were intermediate in colour and in the concentration of dietary carotenoid pigments in their flesh and skin to those parented by either sockeye or kokanee; they were most similar to those parented by known kokanee × sockeye hybrids. This countergradient variation in carotenoid use results in a genotype-environment mismatch in nonanadromous hybrids that exposes them by their breeding colour on the spawning grounds. Given that red colour is important in mate choice, sexual selection will almost certainly reduce reproductive opportunities for these hybrids and promote sympatric divergence of these incipient species. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 84, 287–305.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00430.x/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-29 22:37:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Craib, Kevin JP</author><author>Spittal, Patricia M</author><author>Patel, Sheetal H</author><author>Christian, Wayne M</author><author>Moniruzzaman, Akm</author><author>Pearce, Margo E</author><author>Demerais, Lou</author><author>Sherlock, Christopher</author><author>Schechter, Martin T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus infection among Aboriginal young people who use drugs: results from the Cedar Project</title><secondary-title>Open Medicine</secondary-title><short-title>Prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus infection among Aboriginal young people who use drugs</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Open Medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Open Med</abbr-1></periodical><pages>e220-e227</pages><volume>3</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>7.c Mixed Methods</keyword><keyword>3.a Characterize health impacts</keyword><keyword>2.k General Public</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>25.c Health / Well-being</keyword><keyword>8.b Behavioral or social</keyword><keyword>4.e Infectious disease</keyword><keyword>STI</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-12-15</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1911-2092</isbn><abstract>Background We sought to estimate the prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection among Aboriginal young people who use drugs and to identify risk factors associated with HCV infection in this population. Methods The Cedar Project is a longitudinal study involving Aboriginal young people living in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. Eligibility criteria include age from 14 to 30 years and self-reported use (smoking or injection) of illicit drugs (e.g., crystal methamphetamine, crack cocaine, heroin or other opiates, and cocaine) at least once in the month before enrolment. At each visit, participants completed a detailed questionnaire administered by an Aboriginal interviewer. For this analysis, we included information for 512 participants who were recruited between September 2003 and April 2005. Results Among the 512 participants, the prevalence of HCV infection was 34.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.6%–38.9%); the rates were similar in Prince George and Vancouver (34.5% and 35.0% respectively, p = 0.37). Among those who reported the use of injection drugs at baseline (n = 286), the prevalence of HCV infection was 59.4% (95% CI 53.8%–65.1%); the rate in this group was slightly higher in Prince George than in Vancouver (62.4% v. 57.1% respectively, p = 0.37). The prevalence was 3.5% among participants who reported smoking drugs (n = 226). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, factors significantly associated with HCV infection among participants who used injection drugs included daily injection of opiates (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.0–7.4), reuse of syringes (adjusted OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.3–4.4), having at least 1 parent who attended residential school (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.4), female sex (adjusted OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1–3.4) and duration of injection drug use (per year) (adjusted OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3–1.5). The crude incidence rate of HCV infection was 10.6% and the incidence density estimate was 9.9 per 100 person-years in this cohort. Interpretation The prevalence of HCV infection was elevated among Aboriginal young people living in Prince George and Vancouver who use drugs. Culturally based prevention, treatment and harm-reduction programs are urgently needed in this population.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;PG and Van&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>PubMed Central</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090112/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3090112/</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2023-01-11 04:39:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Collins, Lynda</author><author>Morales, Sarah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Aboriginal Environmental Rights in Tort</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Law and Practice; Scarborough</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Law and Practice; Scarborough</full-title></periodical><pages>1-21</pages><volume>27</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Native North Americans</keyword><keyword>Environmental Studies</keyword><keyword>Law</keyword><keyword>Environmental protection</keyword><keyword>Studies</keyword><keyword>Civil rights</keyword><keyword>Torts</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>11817534</isbn><abstract>While environmental rights have largely been situated within the public law arena of statutes and constitutions, tort law is an important complementary tool for protecting environmental entitlements.

An introductory summary of impacts on temperature, precipitation and streamflow was prepared by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) and presented at several workshops. From the workshops the implications of these changes were identified with feedback from senior city staff and planners and documented in a report, Climate Change in Prince George: Summary of Past Trends and Future Projections and will form the basis of the report Adapting to Climate Change in Prince George. Prince George is a city of roughly 77,000 inhabitants, built on a flood plain at the confluence of the Nechako and Upper Fraser rivers. During the winter of 2007-2008, Prince George experienced severe ice-related flooding when lands along the lower Nechako River were inundated causing extensive damage. The watersheds surrounding Prince George encompass the headwaters of the largest river in BC (the Fraser) and have been heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle. These factors make this region susceptible to climate change impacts, and maintaining water security in this region is a concern to both the residents of Prince George and the Province. Over the last century the city experienced an average warming trend of 1.3°C. In recent decades, Prince George has become warmer in the winter season and a greater percentage of precipitation has fallen as rain rather than snow. Future climate projections were used with an evaluation of uncertainty to allow planners, managers and engineers to better integrate this information and make informed decisions as they prepare to adapt. Annual temperatures in the region are projected to increase by an average of 1.6°C to 2.5°C over the next 50 years. Precipitation during this time is projected to increase by 3% to 10%, with increases occurring primarily in winter and decreases possibly occurring in summer. These precipitation and temperature changes will result in changes to streamflow timing and amount that depend on watershed location and type. PCIC partnered with a local resident and expert in adaptation to synthesize these findings and place them in the context of vulnerabilities particular to their community. PCIC has undertaken several similar assessments and has established that an integral part of the procedure is identifying a local champion who leads the effort of defining community needs and ensuring that the report addresses these issues. The champion facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer that is the first step in the complex and difficult process of engaging stakeholders with diverse needs and conflicting demands for limited water resources. Many organizations and user groups such as Rio Tinto Alcan, who regulate flow on the Nechako River, have a stake in water resource management in this north-central region of the Province.</abstract><remote-database-name>NASA ADS</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009AGUFMGC21A0721R</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-10-11 01:47:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shrestha, Rajesh R.</author><author>Schnorbus, Markus A.</author><author>Peters, Daniel L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of a hydrologic model's reliability in simulating flow regime alterations in a changing climate</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title><abbr-1>Hydrol.

Previous studies indicate that the hydrologic model may not be able to replicate some of the indicators of interest, which raises questions on the reliability of model simulated changes. Hence, we initiated a study to evaluate the replicability of the streamflow changes by employing the widely used variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model for sub-basins and mainstem of the Fraser River Basin, Canada. Given that the hydrologic regime of the region is known to be influenced by teleconnections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we used hydrologic responses to the PDO and ENSO states as analogues for evaluating the model's ability to simulate climate-induced changes. The results revealed that the qualitative patterns of response, such as lower flows for the warm PDO state compared to the cool state, and progressively higher flows for the warm, neutral and cool ENSO states, were generally well reproduced for most hydrologic indicators. Additionally, while the directions of change between the different PDO and ENSO states were mostly well replicated, the magnitude of change for some of the indicators showed considerable differences. Hence, replicability of both magnitude and direction of change need to be carefully examined before using the simulated indicators for assessing future hydrologic changes, and a reliable replication increases the confidence of projected changes.

In the province, there are over 241,500 lakes and reservoirs greater than 1,000 m2in size. These water bodies cover 2.37 percent of the province area and contain an estimated 521 km3of water (312 km3in natural lakes and 209 km3in reservoirs). A hypsometric relation suitable for order-of-magnitude estimates of lake volume from lake area is presented. Based on the distribution and morphometric attributes of lakes, several distinctive limnologic regions were identified, including the northeastern Alberta Plateau (highest proportion of circular lakes), the southwestern Alberta Plateau (lowest lake density/coverage and highest proportion of irregularly shaped lakes) and the Milbanke Strandflat (highest density of lakes). Observed regional and scale-related patterns in lake distribution/morphometry appear to be largely related to geomorphic controls, particularly tectonic and glacial history. Large-scale hydrologic implications of these standing water bodies and potential ecosystem/water resource management applications of the provincial inventory are also discussed.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0008-3658.2004.00064.x/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-08-11 18:55:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shrestha, Rajesh R.</author><author>Schnorbus, Markus A.</author><author>Werner, Arelia T.</author><author>Berland, Anne J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling spatial and temporal variability of hydrologic impacts of climate change in the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title><abbr-1>Hydrol.

This large basin presents a unique modelling case due to its physiographic heterogeneity and the potentially large implications of changes to its hydrologic regime. The macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model was employed to simulate 30-year baseline (1970s) and future (2050s) hydrologic regimes based on climate forcings derived from eight global climate models (GCMs) runs under three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2). Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation was used to statistically downscale GCM outputs to the resolution of the VIC model (1/16°). The modelled future scenarios for the 11 sub-basins and three regions (eastern mountains, central plateau and coastal mountains) of the FRB exhibit spatially varied responses, such as, shifts from snow-dominant to hybrid regime in the eastern and coastal mountains and hybrid to rain-dominant regime in the central plateau region. The analysis of temporal changes illustrated considerable uncertainties in the projections obtained from an ensemble of GCMs and emission scenarios. However, direction of changes obtained from the GCM ensembles and emissions scenarios are consistent amongst one another. The most significant temporal changes could include earlier onsets of snowmelt-driven peak discharge, increased winter and spring runoff and decreased summer runoff. The projected winter runoff increases and summer decreases are more pronounced in the central plateau region. The results also revealed increases in the total annual discharge and decreases in the 30-year mean of the peak annual discharge. Such climate-induced changes could have implications for water resources management in the region. The spatially and temporally varied hydro-climatic projections and their range of projections can be used for local-scale adaptation in this important water resource system for British Columbia.

Recently this method has been called into question and estimation of the effective population size (Ne) proposed as a complementary method to determine population health. We examined genetic diversity in five populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Fraser River watershed (British Columbia, Canada) at 11 microsatellite loci over 20 years using DNA extracted from archived scale samples. We tested for changes in genetic diversity, calculated the ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size to give the statistic M, calculated Ne from the temporal change in allele frequency, used the maximum likelihood method to calculate effective population size (NeM), calculated the harmonic mean of population size, and compared these statistics to annual census estimates. Over the last two decades population size has increased in all five populations of chinook examined; however, Ne calculated for each population was low (81–691) and decreasing over the time interval measured. Values of NeM were low, but substantially higher than Ne calculated using the temporal method. The calculated values for M were generally low (M &lt; 0.70), indicating recent population reductions for all five populations. Large-scale historic barriers to migration and development activities do not appear to account for the low values of Ne; however, available spawning area is positively correlated with Ne. Both Ne and M estimates indicate that these populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding effects and may lack the ability to respond adaptively to stochastic events. Our findings question the practice of relying exclusively on census estimates for interpreting population health and show the importance of determining genetic diversity within populations.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01932.x/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 23:04:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shrestha, Rajesh R.</author><author>Schnorbus, Markus A.</author><author>Cannon, Alex J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Dynamical Climate Model–Driven Hydrologic Prediction System for the Fraser River, Canada</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrometeorology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrometeorology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

This study evaluates the hydrologic prediction skill of a dynamical climate model–driven hydrologic prediction system (CM-HPS), based on an ensemble of statistically downscaled outputs from the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS). For comparison, historical and future climate traces–driven ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) was employed. The Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) hydrologic model setup for the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada, was used as a test bed for the two systems. In both cases, results revealed limited precipitation prediction skill. For streamflow prediction, the ESP approach has very limited or no correlation skill beyond the months influenced by initial hydrologic conditions, while the CM-HPS has moderately better correlation skill, attributable to the enhanced temperature prediction skill that results from CanSIPS’s ability to predict El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its teleconnections. The root-mean-square error, bias, and categorical skills for the two methods are mostly similar. Hydrologic modeling uncertainty also affects the prediction skill, and in some cases prediction skill is constrained by hydrologic model skill. Overall, the CM-HPS shows potential for seasonal streamflow prediction, and further enhancements in climate models could potentially to lead to more skillful hydrologic predictions.</abstract><remote-database-name>journals.ametsoc.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JHM-D-14-0167.1</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-05-08 02:42:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shirvell, C.

Predictions of the model were compared to the location and amount of habitat actually used by adult chinook salmon in 1974, 1980, and 1986. About 3800 m2 (70 per cent) of the spawning area actually used by the population were predicted as unusable by the ‘best’ prediction, while 87 per cent of the area predicted as usable has never had recorded use. The ‘best’ prediction resulted from using close transect spacing, frequent measurements along the transect, river-specific habitat suitability criteria, and modelling habitat at the fish's position near the stream bottom. Depending upon the spacing of the transects and the habitat suitability criteria used, PHABSIM predicted 210 per cent to 660 per cent more spawning habitat was available than historically had ever been used. Chinook salmon in the Nechako River spawn mainly on the upstream face of dunes, therefore, the assumption in PHABSIM that conditions predicted at the transects remain unchanged upstream and downstream part way to the adjacent transects was false. This assumption resulted in about two-thirds of the correct predictions being made for the wrong reason. The accuracy of PHABSIM's predictions for spawning might be improved by incorporating an index of river bottom topography or velocity gradient into the model.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/rrr.3450030127/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-06-06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shaw, Leona R.</author><author>Young, Jane P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethnobotany of Tl'azt'en Nation: Plant Use and Gathering Site Characteristics</title><secondary-title>Ethnobiology Letters</secondary-title><short-title>Ethnobotany of Tl'azt'en Nation</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ethnobiology Letters</full-title></periodical><pages>1-12</pages><volume>3</volume><number>0</number><issue>0</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Ethnobiology</keyword><keyword>Ethnobotany</keyword><keyword>Plant gathering sites</keyword><keyword>Tl’azt’en Nation</keyword><keyword>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-03-07</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2159-8126</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.14237/ebl.3.2012.42</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aboriginal people have intimate and venerable relationships with the environment, and plants were and still are important for food, medicine, and cultural purposes.  The present research is a collaborative project between Tl'azt'en Nation (located in northcentral British Columbia, just north of Fort St. James) and the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC).  The objectives of the study were to collect Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to gain an understanding of the criteria for gathering individual plants for food or medicine use, and to understand why traditional plant gathering sites may fall out of use.  Multiple methods were used to gather information from knowledgeable Tl'azt'enne community members including focus groups, interviews, and field trips.  Community members possess deep understandings of plants and their gathering sites.  People’s concerns include the loss of TEK and changing landscapes due to the effects of disturbances on their lands.  The knowledge gathered and documented throughout the study can be used to promote the preservation of the culture and language of Tl'azt'en Nation</abstract><remote-database-name>ojs.ethnobiology.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ojs.ethnobiology.org/index.php/ebl/article/view/42</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-09-01 23:53:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schiefer, Erik</author><author>Petticrew, Ellen L.</author><author>Immell, Richard</author><author>Hassan, Marwan A.</author><author>Sonderegger, Derek L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Land use and climate change impacts on lake sedimentation rates in western Canada</title><secondary-title>Anthropocene</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anthropocene</full-title><abbr-1>Anthropocene</abbr-1></periodical><pages>61-71</pages><volume>3</volume><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>land use</keyword><keyword>western Canada</keyword><keyword>Lake sediment</keyword><keyword>Mixed-effects modeling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013-11</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2213-3054</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ancene.2014.02.006</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fine sediment derived from catchment erosion can adversely impact aquatic ecosystems. Previous studies of lake sediment deposits in western Canada attributed increased sedimentation to land use; however, high catchment variability and short- and long-term climatic responses complicated the interpretation of those regional records. We compiled a large inventory of lake catchment data transecting the Canadian cordillera that comprised 210Pb-based profiles of deposition, GIS-based land use records, and interpolated climate change data. We used these data and mixed-effects modeling to relate sedimentation trends to land use and climate change since the mid-20th century. Although sedimentation was highly variable, increasing trends in accumulation corresponded with cumulative land use and, to a lesser degree, with climate change. Road density was the most important variable, but the inclusion of timber harvesting density further improved model fits significantly. Land use effects were more difficult to discern for the easternmost region of the Alberta Plateau where sedimentation appeared to be cumulatively associated with both timber and energy resource extraction. Stronger relations were obtained with whole catchment (0.50–273 km2) measures of land use, suggesting that fine sediment is efficiently transferred from hillslopes to the lake basins. While accounting for land use, a climate signal was also detected with improved model fits obtained with the inclusion of catchment warming. Further modeling results suggest that at least one critical control of reconstructed sedimentation remains undetermined. Interdecadal rates of lake sedimentation in western Canada have steadily increased during the late 20th century, following patterns of regional environmental change.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>//www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213305414000083</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Santomauro, Domenico</author><author>Johnson, Chris J.</author><author>Fondahl, Gail</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Historical-ecological evaluation of the long-term distribution of woodland caribou and moose in central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Ecosphere</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosphere</full-title></periodical><pages>1-19</pages><volume>3</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>moose</keyword><keyword>traditional ecological knowledge</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>woodland caribou</keyword><keyword>ecological change</keyword><keyword>historical ecology</keyword><keyword>Hudson's Bay Company</keyword><keyword>species distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-05-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2150-8925</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1890/ES11-00371.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Throughout the 1800s and the 1900s, woodland caribou disappeared from much of the central and southern portions of British Columbia, Canada. Conversely, moose populations expanded during the 1900s and rapidly colonized forested areas formerly occupied by caribou. Although the general trend in range recession and expansion is documented, the processes, timing, and spatial extent of overlap between these two ungulates are uncertain. Such details have implications for our understanding of the ecology of these species and the conservation of woodland caribou. Using historical-ecological methods, we documented the distribution and abundance of caribou and moose over a 150-year period. Also, we evaluated three general sources of evidence for documenting long-term changes in the distribution of hunted or trapped fauna: (1) semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents; (2) journals of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC); and (3) primary written sources. The findings of this study suggested that caribou were relatively wide-spread throughout the study area until the late 1800s when their distribution began to decline. The first recorded sighting of moose in the study area was 1832, although consensus among sources suggested that moose expanded into the area at the end of the 1800s becoming abundant in the 1920s and 1930s. Proposed causes of decline of caribou included climatic change during the 1800s and habitat loss, hunting, and altered predator-prey dynamics through the early 1900s. Our analysis of three sources of historical information and knowledge confirmed the value of Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in documenting and explaining long-term historical distribution of hunted species. Alternatively, HBC journals and other written sources provided good temporal specificity, but few recorded locations of caribou or moose. Documenting changes in the long-term distribution of both species can enlighten conservation planning for woodland caribou.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/ES11-00371.1/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-24 22:44:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sandercock, Leonie</author><author>Attili, Giovanni</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Changing the Lens: Film as Action Research and Therapeutic Planning Practice</title><secondary-title>Journal of Planning Education and Research</secondary-title><short-title>Changing the Lens</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Planning Education and Research</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Planning Education and Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>19-29</pages><volume>34</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-03-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0739-456X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0739456X13516499</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper discusses an action research project in which the making and screening of a film was conceived as a catalyst for social change in a deeply divided community.

While attention has been paid to the local transportation needs of rural seniors, fewer researchers have explored their regional transportation needs. This is important given policies that have reduced and regionalized many services and supports. This article explores mobility constraints impeding rural seniors' access to regionalized services using the example of northern British Columbia. Drawing upon several qualitative studies, we explore geographical, maintenance, organizational, communication, human resources, infrastructure, and financial constraints that affect seniors' regional mobility. Our findings indicate that greater coordination across multiple government agencies and jurisdictions is needed and more supportive policies and resources must be in place to facilitate a comprehensive regional transportation strategy. In addition to discussing the complexities of these geographies, the article identifies innovative solutions that have been deployed in northern British Columbia to support an aging population. This research provides a foundation for developing a comprehensive understanding of the key issues that need to be addressed to inform strategic investments in infrastructure and programs that support the regional mobility and, hence, healthy aging of rural seniors.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Granisle, Burns Lake, Vanderhoof</research-notes><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08959420.2012.683329</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-27 17:38:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Russell, Virginia L.</author><author>e Leeuw, Sarah</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intimate Stories: Aboriginal Women's Lived Experiences of Health Services in Northern British Columbia and the Potential of Creative Arts to Raise Awareness About HPV, Cervical Cancer, and Screening</title><secondary-title>Journal of Aboriginal Health; Victoria</secondary-title><short-title>Intimate Stories</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Aboriginal Health; Victoria</full-title></periodical><pages>18-27</pages><volume>8</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Native American Studies</keyword><keyword>Native People</keyword><keyword>Public Health And Safety</keyword><keyword>Social Services And Welfare</keyword><keyword>Cervical cancer</keyword><keyword>Health care</keyword><keyword>Medical research</keyword><keyword>Public Health</keyword><keyword>Womens health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>17100712</isbn><abstract>Guided by feminist and community-based participatory methodologies and by efforts to decolonize health research practices, and undertaken with qualitative research methods (interviews, open-ended questionnaires, and analysis of arts-based expressions like storytelling, joumaling, and picture-making), this research identified challenges and barriers that (predominantly Aboriginal) women in northern British Columbia faced when trying to access sexual health care services related to HPV and cervical cancer screening. The research also examined the possible effectiveness of creative or arts-based strategies to promote cervical health and screening awareness among young and/or traditionally underserved or marginalized women. We review findings from data gathered over six months during multiple interactions with 22 women from a wide range of ethnic backgrounds. Results confirm that ethnicity, finances, and formal education are determinants in women's awareness about, access to, and use of cervical screening services, and that experiences of gendered victimization, feelings of disempowerment, and life circumstances all influenced women's comfort levels with, access to, and use of cervical cancer screening services.

In addition, cytoxicity assays, to test the anticancer activity of methanolic extracts of Alnus incana and Shepherdia canadensis against mouse mastocytoma cells, were shown to be positive.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378874196014079</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-23 01:09:33</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rice, J</author><author>Rother, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Team approach to charting: medical staff join in</title><secondary-title>Leadership in health services = Leadership dans les services de sante</secondary-title><short-title>Team approach to charting</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Leadership in health services = Leadership dans les services de sante</full-title><abbr-1>Leadersh Health Serv</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5-8</pages><volume>3</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>7.c Mixed Methods</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>2.a Workers</keyword><keyword>25.b Community / Social Systems / Equity</keyword><keyword>3.b.ii Health promotion/education</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994-05-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1188-3669</isbn><abstract>At British Columbia's Prince George Regional Hospital, collaboration between the hospital's chief of medical staff and its manager of health records has resulted in more meaningful, accurate, timely and complete patient records.

In this paper, we review the available information, most of it culled from the “grey” literature. We use a simple one-dimensional morphodynamic model as a conceptual tool to illustrate potential morphological effects of riprap placement in a gravel-bed river, which include inhibition of local sediment supply to the channel and consequent channel bed scour and substrate coarsening, and downstream erosion. Riprap placement also tends to sever organic material input from the riparian zone, with loss of shade, wood input, and input of finer organic material. Available information on the consequences for the aquatic ecosystem mainly concerns effects on commercially and recreationally important fishes. The preponderance of studies report unfavorable effects on local numbers, but habitat niches created by openings in riprap can favorably affect invertebrates and some small fishes. There is a need for much more research on both morphological and ecosystem effects of riprap placement.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jawr.12279/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-05-09 16:30:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Simon, Maciej J.

It is has resulted in and continues in over a million deaths worldwide and halted medical systems and particularly elective surgeries worldwide. The aim of this study was to identify the effect of the initial COVID-19 pandemic months on orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia. Methods: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. Results: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of &gt; 15% (range 0–100%). Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancellation of surgeries has created an increased backlog of 32,400 orthopaedic surgeries in British Columbia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the implementation of telemedicine, which will be a long-lasting benefit in providing healthcare.

This period for boreal forests has been assumed to be 10 years, but this has not been validated empirically for most forest types including sub-boreal spruce-dominated forests of central British Columbia, Canada. Therefore., we sought to determine the timing of the source to sink transition for a sub-boreal clearcut. Clearcuts such as the one documented in this study occurring on glaciolacustrine deposits with relatively poor drainage represent about 20% of the 1.5 million ha in the Prince George area. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) for a clearcut was measured over four growing seasons in years 5, 6, 8 and 10 after harvest. A Bowen ratio approach in combination with a bottom-up modeled NEE based on ecosystem component CO2-flux measurements was used for years 5 and 6. In years 8 and 10, growing season NEE was measured using an open-path eddy covariance system. A cross comparison of Bowen ratio and eddy covariance systems was performed and measurements agreed relatively well (r(2) = 0.58). The results demonstrated that while this clearcut was still a source for C (NEE of +336 to +487 g C m(-2)) after 6 years, it was most likely a sink for C between 8 (NEE of - 189 to -52 g C m(-2)) and 10 (NEE of -185 to -48 g C m(-2)) years following harvest.

Records of Punctum randolphii and Vertigo columbiana are the first higher elevation localities in British Columbia. Pristiloma arcticum was collected from one site in the Babine Mountains and is newly recorded from the province. Microphysula cookei, previously known only from southern British Columbia and adjacent Washington, occurs north to the Babine and Hazelton Ranges, Nechako Plateau, and Boundary Range. While sharing many species in common, the mountain snail fauna differed from that of the adjacent Bulkley Valley by the inclusion of "coastal" and montane elements. Absent from the drier valley floor, Punctum randolphii, Microphysula cookei, Vertigo columbiana and Vespericola columbianus are considered coastal species whose distributions extend far inland along climatically favourable corridors.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Foreman, MGG</author><author>Lee, DK</author><author>Morrison, J</author><author>Macdonald, S</author><author>Barnes, D</author><author>Williams, IV</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulations and retrospective analyses of Fraser watershed flows and temperatures</title><secondary-title>ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ATMOSPHERE-OCEAN</full-title></periodical><pages>89-105</pages><volume>39</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>PACIFIC-OCEAN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0705-5900</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07055900.2001.9649668</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In order to provide better estimates of the thermal-induced stress encountered by salmon migrating to their spawning grounds, a model is used to hindcast temperatures throughout the mainstem Fraser and Thompson Rivers back to 1953. Tributary and headwater temperatures that are not available prior to 1993 are estimated with both linear regression and neural network techniques. The average root mean square difference between model temperatures and those observed at Hell's Gate, on the lower Fraser River, is computed to be 1.12 degreesC. Historical flow and temperature observations are also used to establish patterns and trends for the Fraser River watershed. The Julian day numbers by which one-third and one-half of the integrated yearly discharge had occurred were computed and found to be progressing earlier at the rates of 0.11 and 0.09 days per year, respectively. Both values are significant at the 95% level. Average summer Hell's Gate temperatures from 1941 to 1998 are warming at the rate of 0.012 degreesC per year, though the relatively large standard error of 0.008 degreesC means that this result is not significantly different from zero at the 95% level. However, when the analysis is restricted to 1953 to 1998, the trend becomes 0.022 degreesC per year and the significance level rises to 98%. An analysis of the 1953-98 atmosphere-to-river heat exchange at Kamloops and Prince George produces positive increases of 0.52 W m(-2) per year and 0.90 W m(-2) per year, respectively. When these trends are used to force the river temperature model, they explain approximately 35% of the 1953-98 temperature increase at Hell's Gate. An additional 20% is explained by related increases in the headwater and tributary temperatures. Though these estimates have considerable statistical uncertainty, they nevertheless suggest that most of the river warming can be attributed to climatic effects. Flow rates and river temperatures are also shown to exhibit significant differences in the summers following El Nino and La Nina winters. On average, during the summers following El Nino events, flows are approximately 800 m(3) s(-1) smaller and river temperatures are approximately 0.9 degreesC higher on the lower Fraser River. Similar estimates are produced for the major tributaries and headwaters of the Fraser and Thompson Rivers. The implications for future salmon recruitment are briefly discussed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ford, JC</author><author>Pinder, KE</author><author>Ovalle, WK</author><author>Li, CH</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pathology education in a multisite urban/rural distributed curriculum</title><secondary-title>HUMAN PATHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HUMAN PATHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>811-816</pages><volume>39</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>distributed medical education</keyword><keyword>pathology education</keyword><keyword>rural medical education</keyword><keyword>telepathology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0046-8177,1532-8392</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.humpath.2008.02.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To address concerns about regional physician shortages within British Columbia, the University of British Columbia began distributing its undergraduate medical curriculum across multiple campuses (ie, urban Vancouver, small urban Victoria, and rural Prince George) in 2005. The distribution of the pathology curriculum required meeting 3 specific challenges: (i) implementation of high-quality technologies to facilitate distribution; (ii) recruitment of pathologists to teach; and (iii) creation of an electronic pathology learning center. Technological needs were met by a state-of-the-art audiovisual system allowing simultaneous interactive didactic sessions across all 3 sites, and by the use of a digital "virtual slide" system. Recruitment of pathologist educators proved challenging owing to comparatively limited staffing levels at the rural site. A physical and virtual pathology learning center was developed to assist students in self-directed study. Student performance on pathology examinations has proven to be essentially identical pre- and post-distribution, and is equivalent across all 3 sites. Quantitative and qualitative student survey data show that distributed pathology instruction is overwhelmingly well received by medical students at all sites, that pathologists' expertise is very important to students, and that pathology is one of the most popular components of the distributed curriculum. Pathology education continues to be a vital part of a distributed undergraduate medical program, and student grades and feedback demonstrate the value of the teaching and the technologies we have used. To be implemented successfully, the distribution of pathology education requires considerable financial and infrastructure investment, and ongoing commitment from pathologists and university administrators.

Options for using uneven-aged management to satisfy a range of management objectives were simulated using different sets of BDq regulation parameters, and by varying species composition and rules for reserve trees. The greatest timber yields were attained by promoting the highest possible spruce component, using high q ratios, low to moderate maximum diameters and 20 to 25 year cutting cycles, and allowing no reserves.

Gold is recovered from three Late Pleistocene sedimentary facies: postglacial fluvial gravels (&lt; 10 Ka), Late Wisconsin till(ca. 25-10 Ka), and ''older'' fluvial gravels(&gt; 25 Ka). This study reports the morphology (size, roundness, sphericity) of 1636 gold grains, ranging in size from 0.25 to 17 mm, recovered from 19 placer mines. Older gravels contain the smallest gold grains (mean grain size 1.53 mm), grains of intermediate size occur in till (2.23 mm) and the coarsest gold occurs in postglacial gravels (2.34 mm) with a mean of 1.93 mm for the mining district as a whole. The most common grain shapes are sub-rounded, discoidal (14.73% of the grain population), sub-angular, discoidal (10.88%), and sub-rounded, sub-discoidal (9.59%); the most angular grains occur in postglacial gravels. In-situ growth of coarse, angular grains is indicated by a ''composite'' grain structure, consisting of aggregates of gold particles welded together by high-grade (Ag = &lt; 2%) filamentous gold; in-situ coarsening may be reliant on organic complexing agents produced below a dense forest cover. An evolutionary sequence of grain form, from angular aggregates to rounded ''pumpkin seed'' grains, is suggested. Rounded grains commonly show a crystalline structure which may result from the cold hammering of gold during transport; fracturing along crystal boundaries is common. Gold grains may undergo cycles of coarsening, rounding, diagenesis and breakup in response to repeated recycling through Pleistocene sedimentary environments.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;89</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Elliott, JE</author><author>Wilson, LK</author><author>Henny, CJ</author><author>Trudeau, SF</author><author>Leighton, FA</author><author>Kennedy, SW</author><author>Cheng, KM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessment of biological effects of chlorinated hydrocarbons in osprey chicks</title><secondary-title>ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY</full-title></periodical><pages>866-879</pages><volume>20</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>PACIFIC-NORTHWEST</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS</keyword><keyword>GREAT-LAKES</keyword><keyword>TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTORS</keyword><keyword>POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS</keyword><keyword>CYP1A</keyword><keyword>DIBENZO-P-DIOXINS</keyword><keyword>dioxin</keyword><keyword>DOUBLE-CRESTED CORMORANTS</keyword><keyword>HERRING GULL EMBRYOS</keyword><keyword>ORGANOCHLORINE PESTICIDES</keyword><keyword>osprey</keyword><keyword>REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS</keyword><keyword>toxic equivalents</keyword><keyword>vitamin A</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0730-7268,1552-8618</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/etc.5620200423</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Osprey (Pandion haliaetus) eggs were collected during 1995 and 1996 at seven sites along the Fraser and Columbia River systems of British Columbia, Canada, and Washington and Oregon, USA.

Residual yolk sacs of eggs collected downstream of the large bleached-kraft pulp mill at Castle.-ar contained greater mean concentrations of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD, 2,930 ng/kg lipid) compared with reference sites such as the Nechako River, an upper tributary of the Fraser system (33.7 ng/kg). Total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in yolk sacs were also higher at Castlegar and in samples from the Columbia River downstream of Portland, Oregon, compared with those from the Nechako River. Concentrations of measured chemicals, including TCDD toxic equivalents (TEQs), total PCBs, p,p ' -dichlorodiphenylethylene (p,p ' -DDE), and other organochlorines were not different in eggs that failed to hatch compared with calculated whole-egg values for hatched eggs. There were significant biochemical responses; a hepatic cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A) cross-reactive protein was detected in all samples tested and correlated positively with ethoxyresorufin o-deethylase (EROD) activity and yolk sac concentrations of TEQs and total PCBs. Tissue concentrations of vitamin A compounds varied among sites and correlated positively with yolk sac concentrations of TEQs and PCBs. Morphological, histological, and other physiological parameters, including chick growth, edema, deformities, and hepatic and renal porphyrin concentrations, neither varied among sites nor showed concentration-related effects.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;62 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;66 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;48</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eliason, EJ</author><author>Gale, MK</author><author>Whitney, CK</author><author>Lotto, A</author><author>Hinch, SG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intraspecific differences in endurance swim performance and cardiac size in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) parr tested at three temperatures</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>425-432</pages><volume>95</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>POPULATIONS</keyword><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>MORPHOLOGY</keyword><keyword>aerobic swim performance</keyword><keyword>ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>cardiac</keyword><keyword>COD GADUS-MORHUA</keyword><keyword>DEVELOPMENTAL BIOLOGY</keyword><keyword>EGG SIZE</keyword><keyword>endurance</keyword><keyword>FRASER-RIVER SYSTEM</keyword><keyword>heart</keyword><keyword>local adaptation</keyword><keyword>LOCAL ADAPTATION</keyword><keyword>Oncorhynchus nerka</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>RAINBOW-TROUT</keyword><keyword>sockeye salmon</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4301,1480-3283</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjz-2016-0248</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Pacific salmon encounter widely varying environmental conditions across populations. Performance traits and environmental tolerance limits are predicted to be related to the typical abiotic and biotic conditions encountered by each population. Endurance swim performance at three different temperatures (8, 12, 22 degrees C) was compared across nine populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum, 1792)) parr from British Columbia, Canada, reared in a common laboratory environment. In addition, relative ventricular mass (RVM) was compared between good and poor performers from each population. Populations significantly differed in endurance swim performance and these differences were related to the natal lake environment. Specifically, parr populations that reside in warm, shallow lakes (Okanagan, Scotch, and Stellako) had superior swim performance at 12 degrees C compared with 8 degrees C. All other populations from deeper, cooler lakes had equivalent swim performance at 8 and 12 degrees C. Individual variability in swim performance within a population was not due to differences in cardiac size. Similarly, RVM did not vary across parr populations, suggesting that population differences in swim performance were not associated with cardiac size. This study provides further support that sockeye salmon parr are locally adapted to their environmental conditions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eisenberg, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Decolonizing Authority: The Conflict on Wet'suwet'en Territory</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SCIENCE POLITIQUE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SCIENCE POLITIQUE</full-title></periodical><pages>40-58</pages><volume>55</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>authority</keyword><keyword>decolonization</keyword><keyword>Indigenous politics</keyword><keyword>political and legal pluralism</keyword><keyword>SUPREME-COURT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4239,1744-9324</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0008423921000858</electronic-resource-num><abstract>One of the leading features of colonialism is the imposition on a given territory and people a framework for what constitutes authority that renders pre-existing governing practices and legal orders unrecognizable as features of legitimate law and governance. Understood in this way, colonialism renders Indigenous law and governing practices invisible. As a result, decolonization requires changing how authority is apprehended and not only how it is distributed. This article compares two frameworks of authority in relation to the conflict on Wet'suwet'en territory: liberal postcolonial statism and relational pluralism. It shows how each framework provides a distinct lens through which to understand the pertinent features of political authority but argues that relational pluralism presents a better account of how to reconceive political authority in the context of real-world conflict.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eberle, JJ</author><author>Rybczynski, N</author><author>Greenwood, DR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Early Eocene Mammals from the Dirftwood Creek beds, Dirftwood Canyon Provincial Park, Northern British Columbia.</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>739-746</pages><volume>34</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>GEOCHRONOLOGY</keyword><keyword>ELLESMERE-ISLAND</keyword><keyword>INSECTIVORA</keyword><keyword>LATE PALEOCENE</keyword><keyword>MIDDLE EOCENE</keyword><keyword>OKANAGAN HIGHLANDS</keyword><keyword>PLANT DIVERSITY</keyword><keyword>WASHINGTON-STATE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0272-4634,1937-2809</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02724634.2014.838175</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The early Eocene is an important time in Cenozoic history because it marked the height of global warming, coincident with significant reorganization of the mammalian biota. In North America, our understanding of mammalian diversity during this interval is largely limited to a fossil record south of the 49th Parallel. New discoveries in the early Eocene Driftwood Creek beds (Ootsa Lake Group), northern British Columbia (similar to 55 degrees N) double the known diversity of Eocene mammals from this Canadian province and provide a window into the mammalian community that lived near the northernmost lake of the Okanagan Highlands, a series of Eocene lake deposits extending north-south from Republic, Washington, to Smithers, northern British Columbia. A diverse insect and fish fauna has been described from Okanagan Highlands Eocene lake shales, together with a diverse flora, interpreted as a cool upland forested landscape. We report the tapiroid cf. Heptodon and an erinaceomorph lipotyphlan Silvacola acares, gen. et sp. nov., from the Driftwood Creek beds. Presence of cf. Heptodon is consistent with the late early Eocene age of the Driftwood Creek beds determined by radiometric dating and palynology. Heptodon is otherwise known from Eocene localities in Wyoming and Colorado as well as Ellesmere Island in the High Arctic, whereas erinaceids are recorded from late Paleocene sites in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the U. S. Western Interior and are relatively uncommon at Eocene sites in the U. S. Western Interior. Occurrence of cf. Heptodon at Driftwood Canyon supports the hypothesis proposed by others that tapiroids are proxies of densely forested habitats.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;56</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>e la Bastide, PY</author><author>LeBlanc, J</author><author>Kong, LS</author><author>Finston, T</author><author>May, EM</author><author>Reich, R</author><author>Hintz, WE</author><author>von Aderkas, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fungal colonizers and seed loss in lodgepole pine orchards of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>BOTANY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BOTANY</full-title></periodical><pages>23-33</pages><volume>97</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>SELECTION</keyword><keyword>DIVERSITY</keyword><keyword>BORNE FUNGI</keyword><keyword>endophyte</keyword><keyword>ENDOPHYTIC FUNGI</keyword><keyword>microbiome</keyword><keyword>NEEDLES</keyword><keyword>PATHOGENS</keyword><keyword>Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm. ex S.

Watson) is an important lumber species in Canada, and seed orchards are expected to meet the increased demand for seed. However, seed production has been consistently low in the Okanagan region orchards of British Columbia, Canada. To determine whether the fungal microbiome contributes to seed loss, histological and molecular approaches were used. Seed production was studied at seven Okanagan orchards, all outside the natural range of lodgepole pine, and at one near Prince George, within its natural range. Seed losses were highest in the Okanagan, compared with Prince George. The role of fungal colonizers in consuming seed during the last stages of maturation is described. Fungal hyphae were frequently observed at all locations in developing seed, particularly once storage substances accumulated. Fungi identified from host tissues using molecular and morphological techniques included Alternaria, Cladosporium, Fusarium, Penicillium, and Sydowia. The opportunistic foliar pathogen Sydowia polyspora, which is known to have a variable biotrophic status, was detected at most orchards within different host tissues (seeds, needles, and conelets), in association with pollen, and in the air column. Reduced seed viability observed in Okanagan orchards is most likely due to a combination of factors, including composition of the fungal microbiome.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dylke, E</author><author>Folkestad, C</author><author>Retsina, T</author><author>Savvakis, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thermal optimization study at Prince George - Pinch analysis identified substantial energy savings</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>24-26</pages><volume>104</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>energy conservation</keyword><keyword>optimization</keyword><keyword>pilot projects</keyword><keyword>return on investment</keyword><keyword>steam</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><abstract>A study using Pinch analysis was completed for Canfor Corporation, Prince George Specialty Pulp and Paper Mill.

We use the glacial landform record to determine ice dynamics for the central sector of the CIS in northern British Columbia, Canada, beneath the LGM ice divide. We classify seventy ice-flow indicator flowsets based on morphology, elevation, orientation and cross-cutting relationships into one of three stages, whereby stage 1 is oldest and stage 3 youngest. Combined with ice-contact geomorphology, our reconstruction highlights complex changes in ice flow over time as a result of ice divide migrations through the LGM and deglacial phases. The orientation and distribution of landforms indicates active post-LGM ice retreat westward through the Cassiar and Omineca mountains. We map the regional distribution of independent mountain glaciers, ice caps, and ice fields that regrew during a cooling event in the Late Glacial and show that some of these readvance glaciers were subsequently overrun by advancing outlet glaciers of the CIS. We use the cross-cutting relationship between readvance glaciers and CIS outlet glaciers and available chronological data to reconstruct the eastern CIS margin during the Late Glacial for the first time. ?? 2022 The Authors.

This effect was consistent among clones, and was not due to the absolute diameter of the rootstock or the scion. Trees with increased diameter-growth at the root collar (e.g. some grafted trees) may have increased susceptibility to attack by H. warreni, or diameter-growth at the root collar is affected by the attack.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dubois, B</author><author>Nagy, AG</author><author>Anderson, D</author><author>Simpson, WT</author><author>Appleby, JP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of initial Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy at a Community-Hospital versus a Teaching Hospital.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SURGERY</full-title></periodical><pages>439-444</pages><volume>38</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>BILE-DUCT</keyword><keyword>EXPERIENCE</keyword><keyword>INJURIES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-428X,1488-2310</isbn><abstract>OBJECTIVE: To compare the initiation of laparoscopic cholecystectomy at a community hospital versus a tertiary-care teaching hospital. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTINGS: A general community hospital in Prince George, BC, and a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Vancouver. PATIENTS: One hundred and eighty-two patients in the community hospital and 318 patients in the tertiary-care centre. INTERVENTION: Laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic gallbladder disease. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preparation of surgeons for the new technique, complication rates, operating time, conversion rates to open cholecystectomy and duration of hospitalization. RESULTS: All community surgeons tool; didactic and laboratory courses in preparation for the new procedure and assisted each other for their first 10 cases, but surgeons at the teaching hospital had more varied preparation that included additional extensive laboratory work and preceptorships with surgeons experienced with the procedure. The rates of major complications of laparoscopic cholecystectomy were 6.5% at the community hospital compared with 5% at the tertiary-care centre. The rates of minor complications were 5.5% at community hospital and 5.3% at the tertiary-care centre. The rates of conversion to open cholecystectomy were 6.6% for the community hospital versus 4.7% for teaching hospital. The mean (and standard deviation) operating time was shorter at the community hospital than at the teaching hospital: 72.3 (30) minutes Versus 106 (32) minutes (p &lt; 0.0001). The mean (SD) length of stay was 2.3 (1.8) days at the community hospital and 3.4 (1.9) days at the teaching hospital. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy during a 2-year period was achieved safely at both hospitals. The complication rates were similar. The length of stay and operating times were shorter in the community hospital.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dube, S</author><author>Berch, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring soil disturbance on salvaged areas within the mountain pine beetle infestation using digital imagery</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><keywords><keyword>QUALITY</keyword><keyword>mountain pine beetle</keyword><keyword>INDICATORS</keyword><keyword>monitoring</keyword><keyword>aerial photography</keyword><keyword>digital imagery</keyword><keyword>soil disturbance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1931-3195</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1117/1.JRS.7.073541</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is a concern that the accelerated timber harvest in the mountain pine beetle epidemic area of British Columbia (BC) could compromise long-term forest productivity if soils are unduly disturbed. Consequently, the Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources Operations (MFLNRO) developed a protocol using ground- and image-based methods to assess the status of the forest soil resource in part of the BC Forest and Range Evaluation Program (FREP). Although this protocol uses high-resolution aerial imagery, the MFLNRO is also collecting beetle imagery at a smaller scale for detecting and monitoring. For this evaluation, we use a combination of ground- and imagery-based assessments as developed for FREP within the BC Interior Plateau. We determined that low-resolution data are useful and are sufficient for detecting and measuring the extent of roads and landings. Areas occupied by landslides, erosion, drainage diversion, inordinate disturbance, or roadside work areas can be captured on remote-sensed images with spatial resolution greater than 2.5 m. However, based on this review and previous work, aerial photographs in 10-cm pixel size are best suited to reveal less evident harvesting-related soil disturbance. (c) The Authors.

The inland volcanic belt runs parallel to the coast, and the rocks were emplaced mainly within extensional basins indicating volcanism was attributed to rift-related decompressional melting. The rocks include both talc-alkaline and tholeiitic mafic and intermediate types (i.e., low-Fe, medium-Fe, and high-Fe suites). Voluminous volcanic units (Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, Swans Lake) of the Buck Creek volcanic complex (similar to 3,000 km(2) in area) within the Nechako plateau erupted within 1-2 million years and show significant internal chemical variability. All rock types have similar Sr-Nd isotopic (Sr-87/Sr-86(i)= 0.70435-0.70487; epsilon(Nd)(t). +2.6-+-4.0) ratios indicating they originated from the same sub-Cordilleran mantle source. Petrological modeling using the most primitive rocks of the Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, and Swans Lake magmatic pulses demonstrates that the chemical variability observed in each system can be explained by hydrous fractional crystallization in the upper crust (&lt;= 0.1 GPa) under moderately oxidizing to oxidizing conditions (Delta FMQ 0 to +0.7). The primary difference between the low-Fe to medium-Fe (talc-alkaline) Buck Creek suite model and the high-Fe to medium-Fe (tholeiitic) Swans Lake suite model is water content as the Swans Lake model has lower (H2O = 0.75 wt.%) starting water than the Buck Creek and also the Goosly Lake models (H2O =1.25-2.00 wt.%). Moreover, the intermediate to silicic rocks of the complexes are compositionally similar to rocks associated with "slab failure" suggesting that rifting and mantle melting were related to asthenospheric upwelling through a slab tear. The implications are that the chemical variability of the rock suites are primarily related to fractional crystallization and that the mantle source is heterogeneous with respect to water content which is likely due to heterogeneities in the processes related to pre-Eocene subduction.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;74</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dirszowsky, RW</author><author>Desloges, JR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Testing lake sediment and Dendrogeomorphic proxies for little ice age environmental change in th Upper Fraser River area, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOGRAFISKA ANNALER SERIES A-PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY</full-title></periodical><pages>393-410</pages><volume>92A</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>ALBERTA</keyword><keyword>BANFF NATIONAL-PARK</keyword><keyword>CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>MOOSE LAKE</keyword><keyword>RECORD</keyword><keyword>lake sediments</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN COAST MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>Canadian Rocky Mountains</keyword><keyword>HOLOCENE GLACIER FLUCTUATIONS</keyword><keyword>LATEST PLEISTOCENE</keyword><keyword>LILLOOET LAKE</keyword><keyword>Little Ice Age</keyword><keyword>moraine chronologies</keyword><keyword>ROCKY-MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>varves geochemical records</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0435-3676</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1468-0459.2010.00403.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study assesses Little Ice Age (LIA) lake sediment morphological and geochemical records and moraine chronologies in the upper Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, Canada, to resolve differences in paleoenvironmental interpretation and to clarify sediment production and sediment delivery processes within alpine geomorphic systems Moose Lake (13 9 km(2)), situated at 1032 ma sl, contains a partially varved record indicating variable rates of accumulation during the last millennium that, in general, coincide with previously documented LIA glacial advances in the region and locally Dendrochronological assessment of forefield surfaces in the headwaters of the catchment (Reef Icefield) shows that periods of moraine construction occurred just prior to AD 1770, AD 1839 and AD 1883, and some time before AD 1570 Taken collectively, increases in varve thickness within eight Moose Lake sediment cores coincide with documented glacier advances over the twelfth through fourteenth centuries, the eighteenth century, and nineteenth through twentieth centuries Glacial activity during the sixteenth century is also indicated While varve thickness variations in proximal and distal sediments clearly reflect glacial activity upstream of Moose Lake, the intermediate varve record is relatively insensitive to these decadel and longer-term catchment processes.

Delta-top changes are interpreted from surface channel morphology, riverbank exposures, hand auger data, vibracores and other borehole records. River channel and overbank sediments are related to source area contributions in terms of granule lithology and fine (&lt;63 mum) fraction geochemistry. A substantial area of the northeast delta-top floodplain dates from the early Holocene, and is characterized by fragmentary, low-discharge paleochannels with bed material characteristic of the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Floodplain development since ca. 4.0 ka BP has been limited to the western and southern areas of the delta and records persistently higher sediment loads, aggradation and larger, more active channels. These changes reflect overall shifts from warm, dry Hypsithermal to cooler, wetter Neoglacial climatic conditions defined regionally. The composition of both laterally and vertically accreted floodplain sediments plus channel morphology and floodplain stratigraphy record the changing influence of partially glaciated source areas on the Holocene sediment flux. Specifically, periods of climatic deterioration and possibly glacier expansion lead to relatively greater yields of carbonate-rich sediment from the higher elevation Moose River sub-basin. Storage and reworking of sediments on the Moose Lake delta-top floodplain influence interpretation of the more distal lacustrine record. Over the last 4000 years, gradual increases in lacustrine sedimentation rate of up to similar to 18% are inferred to result from delta progradation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The &lt;63 mum fraction is emphasized for its relative mobility and ease of analysis using instrumental neutron activation. Overall, the composition of the stream sediments closely reflects bedrock distribution. Samples dominated by limestone and dolostone, calcite and dolomite, and related elements (Ca, Mg, Sr etc.) correspond to Lower and Middle Cambrian carbonate bedrock largely confined to the Moose River sub-basin. Clastic and non-quartzite metamorphic lithologies, primary and secondary aluminosilicate minerals and related elements (Al, Cs, Rb etc.) are largely derived from Miette Group bedrock and associated with the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Except in the case of the Moose River/Fraser River junction, the determination of proportional tributary contributions is complicated by variable or delayed mixing, localized floodplain or valley side sources, and limited contrast between source areas. At present the Moose River sub-basin contributes a greater proportion of the total and fine-grained sediment loads of the combined Fraser River than would be expected from drainage basin area alone. The imbalance is related to greater relief, precipitation and runoff in the Moose River sub-basin; however, the spatial association of carbonate-rich stream sediments, ice cover and carbonate bedrock exposure indicates that glaciers play a particularly important roll in generating fine-grained fluvial sediment. Since differences in glacier cover and glacier potential in the two major sub-basins are likely to be persistent, and since relative sediment yields from the sub-basins can be determined from sediment composition, a potential indicator of glacier variation and climate change during the Holocene is therein available.

Basal diamicts are unconformably overlain by coarse sand and silt deposited as turbidity currents in an ice-dammed lake during final retreat of Wisconsinan ice. Rapid withdrawal of the valley glacier resulted in a fully developed Moose Lake followed by low rates of sediment input for much of the early and middle Holocene until approximately 4,100 years BP. At that time, sediment input doubled and then tripled by 3,120 years BP in response to cooling and several phases of regionally documented glacier expansions. The transition from the Altithermal dry/warm period to the Neoglacial cooling is coincident with the formation of varves at Moose Lake which provide a chronology of changing Neoglacial sediment inputs. The glacier-climate signal recorded in Moose Lake sediments suggests distinct thresholds for changes in sedimentation style that are dependent on both climatic and geomorphic conditions affecting the watershed. Early in the record, direct connection to glaciogenic sediment production produced highly variable sedimentation rates that ended abruptly as the ice-front retreated. In the middle record, climate conditions that led to greatly reduced ice extent and lower sediment production in the upper Fraser and Moose river watersheds, changed abruptly resulting in varve formation. The change in style and increased sedimentation was caused directly by greater seasonal variations in sediment input due to climate-controlled glacier advances beyond modern limits. While sediment supply is a factor, comparison of the sediment record with tree-ring responses to climate change suggest both summer temperature and winter precipitation are important controls of Holocene variations in sediment yield.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Delong, SC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The light interception Index-A potential tool for assisting in vegetation management decisions.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</full-title></periodical><pages>1037-1042</pages><volume>21</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>DOUGLAS-FIR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/x91-142</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Light interception by vegetation canopies surrounding white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss) was studied for four different vegetation complexes on two sites near Prince George, British Columbia.

Rates of foliage development of the different vegetation canopies studied had a significant effect on their degree of light interception over the growing season. Canopies dominated by fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium L.) developed foliage at a faster rate than canopies dominated by other species, especially those dominated by thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus Nutt.).

We examine scenarios where a localized monochromatic source along the magnetopause boundary launches MHD fast mode ultralow frequency (ULF) waves into the magnetosphere, where they couple to shear Alfven waves. Sharply peaked field line resonance (FLR) structures are found to form at discrete locations within the magnetosphere in response to the fast mode driver. The extent in local time and relative amplitudes of FLR structures are found to depend strongly on the source location along the magnetopause boundary, indicating how the addition of day/night asymmetry affects the penetration of MHD fast waves within the magnetosphere. This also suggests that observed FLR structures within the magnetosphere may be used to deconvolve the spatial characteristics of the ULF wave source at the magnetopause, giving insight to the excitation mechanism responsible for observed ULF waves. As an example, we consider narrow band ULF activity observed on 25 November 2001 during a high solar wind speed interval following a geomagnetic storm and qualitatively reproduce the spatial and temporal characteristics of observations made by the Prince George SuperDARN radar by constraining the ULF wave source characteristics.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Leeuw, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intimate colonialisms: the material and experienced places of British Columbia's residential schools</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>339-359</pages><volume>51</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CARTOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>POWER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1541-0064.2007.00183.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The theoretical premise of this paper is that place is an unbounded material, social and cultural agent within and through which practices of colonialism were enacted in British Columbia. Specifically, the places of British Columbia's 'Indian' residential schools, and the subjects who occupied them, are conceptualized as intimate sites nested within Canadian colonial and nation-building agendas that were predicated on policies of assimilation, enculturation or annihilation of indigenous people. Such conceptualizations allow for an understanding of both how colonialism was actualized against First Nations' peoples and how First Nations' peoples actively navigated and resisted that colonial project. In order to access experiences of residential school places, the article draws from published First Nations' testimonial literatures. It also draws from creative materials produced by students within the schools in order to understand how First Nations' students articulated against assimilative educational processes. The article concludes with a consideration of how nested place, First Nations' resistances, and Euro-colonial concepts of gender are circulating today with reference to a Dakelh woman (and former residential school student) under consideration for beatification in northern British Columbia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;68</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dawson, KM</author><author>Sinclair, AJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Factor-analysis of minor element data for Pyrites, Endako Molybdenum Mine, British-Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>404-411</pages><volume>69</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1974</year><pub-dates><date>1974</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0361-0128</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2113/gsecongeo.69.3.404</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dawson, KM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geology of Endako mine.

The Complex consists of a carbonatite plug with a series of carbonatite and potassic-syenite dykes and sills emplaced into the upper Cambrian and lower Ordovician Kechika Group. The carbonatite is classified as a calcio- to ferro-carbonatite. Sodic-fenitization is common around the carbonatite and the degree of alteration and frequency of syenite occurrences increase away from the carbonatite plug. The rare earth mineralogy of the Wicheeda carbonatite was defined through the use of petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The REE mineralogy is complex, with multiple stages of primary, late-stage, rapidly cooling crystallization. The mineralogy consists of Ca-REE-fluorocarbonates [including bastnasite-(Ce), parisite-(Ce), and synchysite-(Ce)], Ba-REE-fluorocarbonates [including cordylite-(Ce), kukharenkoite-(Ce), cebaite-(Ce), huangnoite-(Ce), and qaqarssukite-(Ce)], ancylite-(Ce), monazite-(Ce), euxenite-(Y) and allanite-(Ce); the majority of which are LREE-rich. The REE minerals typically form in anhedral aggregates with strontianite, calcite, dolomite, and ankerite. The aggregates range in size from a 1-2 mm but have been observed up to 7 cm. The Ca-REE-fluorocarbonate minerals generally form as syntaxial intergrowths whereas the other REE minerals form individual crystals. The REE content varies throughout the carbonatite intervals with an average of 9663 ppm. Evidence from the Wicheeda Carbonatite Complex and comparisons with other worldwide carbonatites suggest that the complex is derived from low-degree partial melts extracted from metasomatized lithospheric mantle.

Since 1993, the federal government of Canada, the provincial government of British Columbia, and approximately two-thirds of the First Nations in British Columbia have been engaged in treaty and land claim negotiations under a unique British Columbia treaty process. To date the process has produced only five agreements, three of which are fully ratified, one of which is in the ratification process, and one of which was rejected by the First Nations membership. This article reviews the history of treaties in British Columbia and uses exploratory illustrative case studies to examine two of these recent treaty negotiations-the Lheidli T'enneh First Nations and the Tsawwassen First Nations. These case studies demonstrate that treaty negotiations are very complex processes and do not always achieve mutual agreement, yet features of governance and land ownership included in these agreements have implications for land use policy and planning that affect all First Nations people in British Columbia, in Canada, and around the world.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Curran, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indigenous Processes of Consent: Repoliticizing Water Governance through Legal Pluralism</title><secondary-title>WATER</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WATER</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>KNOWLEDGE</keyword><keyword>PERSPECTIVES</keyword><keyword>decision-making processes</keyword><keyword>environmental assessment</keyword><keyword>environmental flows</keyword><keyword>FPIC</keyword><keyword>free</keyword><keyword>governmentalities</keyword><keyword>groundwater</keyword><keyword>law</keyword><keyword>politics</keyword><keyword>prior and informed consent</keyword><keyword>UNDRIP</keyword><keyword>water governance</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2073-4441</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/w11030571</electronic-resource-num><abstract>While international instruments and a few state governments endorse the "free, prior and informed consent" of Indigenous peoples in decision-making about the water in their traditional territories, most state water governance regimes do not recognize Indigenous water rights and responsibilities. Applying a political ecology lens to the settler colonialism of water governance exposes the continued depoliticizing personality of natural resources decision-making and reveals water as an abstract, static resource in law and governance processes. Most plainly, these decision-making processes inadequately consider environmental flows or cumulative effects and are at odds with both Indigenous governance and social-ecological approaches to watershed management. Using the example of groundwater licensing in British Columbia, Canada as reinforcing colonialism in water governance, this article examines how First Nations are asserting Indigenous rights in response to natural resource decision-making. Both within and outside of colonial governance processes they are establishing administrative and governance structures that express their water laws and jurisdiction. These structures include the Syilx, Nadleh Wut'en and Stellat'en creating standards for water, the Tsleil-Waututh and Stk'emlupsemc te Secwepemc community assessments of proposed pipeline and mining facilities, and the First Nations of the Nicola Valley planning process based on their own legal traditions. Where provincial and federal environmental governance has failed, Indigenous communities are repoliticizing colonial decision-making processes to shift jurisdiction towards Indigenous processes that institutionalize responsibilities for and relationships with water.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;97</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crowley, SM</author><author>Hodder, DP</author><author>Johnson, CJ</author><author>Yates, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Wildlife health indicators and mercury exposure: A case study of river otters (Lontra canadensis) in central British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS</full-title></periodical><pages>63-73</pages><volume>89</volume><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>BIRDS</keyword><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>AGE</keyword><keyword>METHYLMERCURY</keyword><keyword>Mercury</keyword><keyword>HABITAT SELECTION</keyword><keyword>HAIR</keyword><keyword>Indicators</keyword><keyword>Lontra canadensis</keyword><keyword>LUTRA-LUTRA</keyword><keyword>MINK MUSTELA-VISON</keyword><keyword>PINCHI LAKE REGION</keyword><keyword>POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS</keyword><keyword>River otter</keyword><keyword>Wildlife health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1470-160X,1872-7034</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.01.061</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Indicators of wildlife health are important elements of a comprehensive approach for assessing and monitoring trends of methyl mercury (MeHg) contamination in the environment. River otters (Lontra canadensis) have been used as a model species for toxicological studies on the effects of MeHg bioaccumulation due to their position as an apex predator in aquatic systems and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Although laboratory studies suggest that sublethal MeHg exposure may have detrimental effects on wildlife, they are limited in their ability to reflect real world exposure and forecast population level effects. Few studies have identified the threshold at which MeHg exposure results in a population-level effect for wild populations of river otters in marine or freshwater systems. We used a series of data sets collected over a 7-year period for river otter populations in central British Columbia, Canada, to assess mercury concentrations (river otter fur) and measurements of population status and health relative to a lake with an inactive and reclamated mercury mine along its shoreline (Pinchi Lake). We used a combination of remote cameras, marked individuals, hair snares, and scat counts/inventories to collect measurements of population status and health including: activity levels, population estimates, sex ratios, group sizes, litter sizes, behaviour, stress hormones, diet, and habitat quality. We found that mercury concentrations in river otter inhabiting Pinchi Lake were significantly higher than all other lakes in the study, and were also high relative to other areas in Canada and the United States. We did not, however, detect significant differences between the two lakes in many of the population parameters measured. We discuss the knowledge gaps and challenges of identifying the effects of MeHg for wild populations of mammals, determining sensitive and appropriate methods for measuring these effects, and the implications of our results for monitoring the impacts of natural resources activities. Detailed studies on population effects across a range of exposure and background conditions are required to address these data deficiencies. Typically, river otters are not included as monitoring species in environmental assessments even though their value as an indicator of anthropogenic contaminants has clearly been documented. We encourage inclusion of river otters in environmental assessments pre-, during-, and post-industrial activities as a measure of pollutant exposure and bioavailability as well as a critical first step in addressing knowledge gaps associated with contaminants and its effects on populations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;73</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Craig, JK</author><author>Foote, CJ</author><author>Wood, CC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence for temperature-dependent sex determination in sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>141-147</pages><volume>53</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>POPULATIONS</keyword><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>SELECTION</keyword><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>RATIO</keyword><keyword>RAINBOW-TROUT</keyword><keyword>CHROMOSOMES</keyword><keyword>GENETIC-DIFFERENCES</keyword><keyword>KOKANEE</keyword><keyword>MENIDIA-MENIDIA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0706-652X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/f95-152</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Temperature-dependent sex determination has been demonstrated in several animals, but in salmonids sex is generally believed to be under strict genetic control. We observed distorted sex ratios, attributable to a temperature manipulation during embryonic development, in experiments conducted during 1991 with the anadromous and nonanadromous (kokanee) forms of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Takla Lake, British Columbia. Sex ratios ranged from 62 to 84% female, and the biased ratio could not be accounted for by differential mortality by sex. The effect was observed independently in sockeye and kokanee crosses, as well as in the reciprocal hybrids. Similar crosses from Takla Lake in a previous year (1989) in which incubation temperature was not manipulated resulted in normal (1:1) sex ratios. Other populations of sockeye and kokanee from the same year (1991) but undergoing no temperature manipulation maintained normal sex ratios, as did populations from several disparate locations and years (1986-1994). The parsimonious conclusion is that the temperature manipulation during development was responsible for the biased sex ratio through a direct influence on sex differentiation. Hence, the possibility that temperature-dependent sex determination occurs in O. nerka, and perhaps other salmonids, deserves rigorous testing.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;84 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;94 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Crossin, GT</author><author>Hinch, SG</author><author>Cooke, SJ</author><author>Welch, DW</author><author>Batten, SD</author><author>Patterson, DA</author><author>Van Der Kraak, G</author><author>Shrimpton, JM</author><author>Farrell, AP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Behaviour and physiology of sockeye salmon homing through coastal waters to a natal river</title><secondary-title>MARINE BIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MARINE BIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>905-918</pages><volume>152</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>SWIMMING PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>MIGRATION</keyword><keyword>FRASER-RIVER</keyword><keyword>ONCORHYNCHUS-NERKA</keyword><keyword>EN-ROUTE MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>COHO</keyword><keyword>ENERGY USE</keyword><keyword>ORIENTATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0025-3162,1432-1793</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00227-007-0741-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka, N = 179) from six Fraser River populations (British Columbia) were intercepted in continental shelf waters similar to 215 km from the Fraser River mouth, gastrically implanted with acoustic transmitters, non-lethally biopsied for blood biochemistry, gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity and somatic energy density and then released. Migration behaviour and travel times to the river mouth and into the river were monitored by underwater telemetry receivers positioned at the river mouth and in the river. Post-release survival of salmon was excellent, with 84% (N = 150) of fish reaching the furthest receiving station similar to 85 km upriver. Fish from Late-summer run populations (Adams and Weaver Creek) averaged a migration rate of similar to 20 km day(-1) through the marine area and held at the river mouth and adjacent areas for 7-9 days before entering the river. Summer-run populations (Birkenhead, Chilko, Horsefly and Stellako) had a migration rate similar to 33 km day(-1) and held for only 1-3 days. Once in river, similar patterns were observed: Late-run populations migrated at similar to 28 km day(-1) and Summer-run populations at similar to 40 km day(-1). From point of release to the river mouth, males migrated faster than females, but once in river migration rates did not differ between sexes. Among all females, a correlation was discovered between levels of circulating testosterone and river entry timing. This correlation was not observed among males. Plasma K+, Cl-, glucose, lactate and osmolality were also correlated with entry timing in both sexes.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coxson, D</author><author>Bjork, C</author><author>Bourassa, MD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The influence of regional gradients in climate and air pollution on epiphytes in riparian forest galleries of the upper Fraser River watershed</title><secondary-title>BOTANY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BOTANY</full-title></periodical><pages>23-45</pages><volume>92</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>air pollution</keyword><keyword>COMMUNITIES</keyword><keyword>ABUNDANCE</keyword><keyword>BARK</keyword><keyword>DEPOSITION</keyword><keyword>EMISSIONS</keyword><keyword>Fraser River</keyword><keyword>INDICATOR</keyword><keyword>lichens</keyword><keyword>LICHENS</keyword><keyword>LOBARIA-PULMONARIA</keyword><keyword>MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>NITROGEN</keyword><keyword>riparian forests</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1916-2790,1916-2804</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjb-2013-0151</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Epiphyte diversity and abundance were examined along the Fraser River and its tributaries in central-interior British Columbia at varying distances from point-source air pollution discharges. Black cottonwood (Populus balsamifera L. ssp. trichocarpa (Torr. &amp; A. Gray ex Hook.) Brayshaw trunks near discharges in Prince George had comparatively low epiphyte diversity and supported an unusual acidiphilic lichen community, including Tuckermannopsis chlorophylla (Willd.) Hale, Usnea lapponica Vain., and Vulpicida canadensis (Rasanen) J.-E. Mattsson &amp; M.J. Lai. At a greater distance from air pollution sources, a more characteristic flora was observed, including Collema Wigg. spp., Lecidea erythrophaea Florke, Leptogium (Ach.) Gray spp., Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm., Nephroma parile (Ach.) Ach., Peltigera Willd. spp., and Strangospora moriformis (Ach.) Stein. These changes were accompanied by large differences in bark pH; mean values ranged from 3.7 in Prince George to 6.7 in upriver stands for black cotton-woods, from 3.5 to 5.4 for live spruce branches (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss), and from 3.1 to 4.9 for dead spruce branches, respectively. Epiphyte communities proximal to Prince George were characterized by many nitrophilous species. Our data showed a strong covariate influence of climate, with Lobarion community lichens more abundant in the easternmost high-precipitation plots. Numerous provincial-and global-level conservation priority species were found, including Collema quadrifidum D. F.

In Hypothesis A, representative of a family of models based on geologic evidence, the Insular and Intermontane superterranes and the Intervening mid-Cretaceous Coast Mountains orogen were situated in their present positions relative to cratonic North America, 90 my ago. In the alternative Hypothesis B, based on paleomagnetic data, the Insular superterrane and the Coast Mountains orogen along: its eastern edge were situated 3000 km south of their present positions, 90 my ago. This crustal element, Baja British Columbia, then moved northward between 90 and 70 Ma along the hypothetical, coast-parallel, Baja B.C. fault system. At 70 Ma, Baja British Columbia was Juxtaposed with the western part of the Intermontane superterrane, which lay 1100 km south of its present position. Between 70 and 50 Ma, the composite block moved northward an additional 1100 km along the hypothetical Intra-Quesnellia fault, located within the Intermontane superterrane. A goal of the hypothetico-deductive scientific method is the elimination of false hypotheses using empirical tests. A review of the logical arguments governing this method shows that if two contradictory hypotheses are judged to have non-negligible prior probabilities-if both have a significant likelihood of being true-then a crucial test can potentially lead to the refutation of one hypothesis and provide empirical support for the alternative. A crucial test is possible when an observational prediction of one model is prohibited by an alternative model. To evaluate whether hypothesis A or B can be ruled out by geologic evidence, we propose four crucial tests independent of paleomagnetic tests. To test the Baja British Columbia hypothesis, potentially useful geologic evidence includes: (1) the provenance of detritus in mid-Cretaceous strata in the Methow and Tyaughton basins; (2) the provenance of detritus in pre-late Campanian strata in the Nanaimo Group; (3) offset geologic features in BaJa British Columbia matching counterparts in southwestern California and northwestern Mexico; and (4) Late Cretaceous or older geologic features limiting offset across the transcurrent Baja B.C. fault to &lt; 1000 km.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;183 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;186 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;141</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cook, SJ</author><author>Levson, VM</author><author>Giles, TR</author><author>Jackman, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of regional lake sediment and till geochemistry surveys- A case stufy  the Fawnie Creek area, Central British-Columbia</title><secondary-title>EXPLORATION AND MINING GEOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EXPLORATION AND MINING GEOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>93-110</pages><volume>4</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0964-1823</isbn><abstract>Results of regional lake sediment and till geochemistry surveys conducted in central British Columbia are compared for gold, arsenic, antimony, copper, zinc, molybdenum and lead. Samples were collected from 171 till sites and 119 lake sediment sites in a 1:50000 scale map sheet (NTS 93F/03). Surficial and bedrock geology maps and mineral deposit data are used to help evaluate the geochemical results. Till samples are from lodgment and basal meltout tills rather than other types of till or surficial sediment. Lake sediment sample sites include every lake and pond in the survey area and all major sub-basins in large lakes. The corroborative nature of the till and lake sediment geochemical surveys is indicated by the detection of all existing mineral occurrences in the map region by both methods, except two prospects not detected in the lake sediment data because they have no nearby lakes. Anomalous (&gt; 95th percentile) concentrations of the seven elements in lake sediments and tills generally occur up to a few kilometers down-slope and down-ice, respectively, of mineralized areas. In addition, eleven new exploration targets with multi-element geochemical anomalies are highlighted by the two surveys. Six of the target areas are indicated by data from both sample media, three by till data alone and two by lake sediment data alone. The two surveys are also complementary, first because geologic interpretations from each can be integrated to constrain the location of potential mineralized source areas. Second, helicopter-supported lake sediment surveys and ground-based till surveys are often best suited for different areas due to variable access and terrain conditions, making the two survey types geographically complementary.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cook, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution and dispersion of molybdenum in lake sediments adjacent to porphyry molybdenum mineralization, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION</full-title></periodical><pages>13-50</pages><volume>71</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Nechako Plateau</keyword><keyword>lake sediments</keyword><keyword>geochemical exploration</keyword><keyword>molybdenum</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0375-6742,1879-1689</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0375-6742(00)00140-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study investigates geochemical controls on sediment metal distributions for three lakes and groups of lakes adjacent to sub-economic porphyry Mo prospects in the Endako region of central British Columbia. Tatin Lake, Hanson Lake and the Counts Lakes are within Middle Jurassic felsic intrusive rocks of the Francois Lake plutonic suite. The objectives are to determine: (i) the extent to which lake sediment geochemistry reflects the presence of adjacent porphyry Mo prospects; (ii) distribution patterns of Mo and other elements in lake sediments, and (iii) the effectiveness of lake sediments as a regional Mo exploration medium. Bottom waters of Tatin Lake are anoxic below 15-17 m depth and a range of limnological regimes, from eutrophic to oligotrophic, are present in three sub-basins. Mo-Cu mineralization occurs northwest of the lake. Hanson Lake is thermally unstratified, with sub-oxic to anoxic conditions occurring locally below 4-5 m depth. A Mo-Cu showing is present about 2.5 km south of the lake, and there is an extensive area of elevated Zn-Pb-Cu in soils to the north. The Counts lakes are a group of small, mostly eutrophic, lakes and ponds downslope of known Mo mineralization. Sediments at Tatin, Hanson and the Counts Lakes contain elevated median Mo concentrations of 8 ppm (max: 23 ppm), 7 ppm (max: 55 ppm) and 42 ppm (max: 165 ppm), respectively, relative to regional background of 1-2 pm. Mo distribution patterns are influenced by proximity to mineralization, basin morphology, limnological variations and the high organic matter content of centre-basin sediments. The distribution of Mo in lake sediments reflect the locations of adjacent quartz-molybdenite veins and their dispersed remnants in soil and till. Anomaly patterns are interpreted to be of hydromorphic origin, with Mo transported to lake basins in sub-surface ground water and, to a lesser extent, surface waters prior to complexing by organic-rich sediments. Most of the highest Mo concentrations in Tatin Lake are in the west end of the lake (up to 14 ppm), in near-shore shallow-water organic sediments near Mo-Cu mineralization and in profundal sediments of the westernmost sub-basin. There is a close association between the distribution of Mo and Lot. Elevated Mo concentrations (11-18 ppm) are closely associated with centre-lake profundal sediments in Hanson Lake. Sediment geochemical patterns in the Counts Lakes are strongly influenced by proximity to Mo mineralization, with the highest Mo concentrations (max: 165 ppm) in the westernmost ponds downslope of known prospects. Centre-basin results from Tatin Lake (12, 7-10, 23 ppm), Hanson Lake (11-12 ppm) and the Counts lakes (49, 160, 60, 33, 38, 56, 54, 83 ppm) exceed regional background by 3-80x. Elevated centre-basin Mo concentrations of at least 12 ppm reflect the presence of adjacent porphyry Mo mineralization. Centre-lake sediments do not however always have the highest Mo concentrations, due to variations in Mo content between sub-basins of the same lake and to the presence of near-shore Mo zoning patterns downslope and down drainage of mineralization. Centre-lake sampling of every lake and sub-basin is recommended for regional geochemical surveys. For follow-up surveys, near-shore sediments should also be sampled, particularly at base of slope and adjacent to drainage inflows, to delineate any lateral zoning patterns which may infer a general direction toward buried mineral deposits.

Samples collected with the Hornbrook-type sampler typically weigh 50 to 100 g when dry, and doubling the size of the field samples might be expected to yield more representative and reliable An concentrations. To test this hypothesis, a comparative study of two field sample sizes was conducted in Clisbako Lake, adjacent to the Clisbako epithermal gold prospect, to ascertain whether or not there are significant differences in Au concentrations with increasing sample size. Clisbako Lake is located about 100 km west of Quesnel in the Fraser Plateau, an area of low to moderate relief and extensive drift cover. Gold occurs in quartz stockwork and silicified breccia zones within a low-sulphidation adularia-sericite epithermal system hosted in Eocene continental volcanics. Two corresponding lake sediment samples were collected at each of 36 sites: a standard sample obtained from a single drop of the sampler, and a second, larger sample obtained by combining sediment from two drops of the sampler. Sediments were dried, disaggregated and pulverized in a ceramic ring mill prior to analysis for An and additional elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Gold concentrations in the centre of the profundal basin (4-8 ppb) are considerably greater than the regional median of 1 ppb in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Elevated concentrations of Au, As (median: 25.5 ppm) and Sb (median: 3.1 ppm) in lake sediments reflect the geochemistry of adjacent zones of epithermal mineralization and alteration. Median concentrations of 9 ppb Au over the entire lake were obtained for both standard and large-size sample suites, and gold distribution patterns are similar for both sample sizes. Equivalency of population means were tested with a two-sample paired duplicate t-test and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) on 34 sample pairs. Results indicate that there is no significant difference between Au concentrations of the standard and large-size lake sediment samples. There is no evidence to suggest that use of larger, more costly, lake sediment samples are more effective or reliable indicators of epithermal Au mineralization in this region than standard-size samples. The standard samples are satisfactory media for regional and property-scale lake sediment geochemical surveys.

Temperature and humidity sensors were installed in the north and south exterior wall assemblies to measure long-term hygrothermal performance. Data collected between 2018-2020 shows no record of long-term moisture accumulation within the exterior assemblies. Data collected during this time period was used to validate hygrothermal performance models for the building created using the WUFI(R) Plus software. Long-term performance models created using future climate data for five cities across Canada under two global warming scenarios shows favorable results, with an increase in average annual temperatures resulting in lower average relative humidity values at the interior face of the exterior sheathing board in the exterior wall assemblies.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Comeau, PG</author><author>Gendron, F</author><author>Letchford, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A comparison of several methods for estimating light under a paper birch mixedwood stand</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>1843-1850</pages><volume>28</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>FORESTS</keyword><keyword>REGIMES</keyword><keyword>RADIATION</keyword><keyword>AVAILABILITY</keyword><keyword>CANOPIES</keyword><keyword>COMPETITION INDEXES</keyword><keyword>GAPS</keyword><keyword>HEMISPHERICAL PHOTOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>INTERCEPTION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067,1208-6037</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfr-28-12-1843</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In 1996 we initiated a study to evaluate several techniques for measuring light under broadleaf canopies. Hourly average photosynthetic photon flux density and percent transmittance were measured 1 m above the ground at four points in each of three canopy densities created by a spacing experiment in a 35-year-old paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh.) dominated stand located near Prince George, B.C. At each point, fisheye photographs were taken and LAI-2000 plant canopy analyzer (LAI-2000), spherical densiometer, and competition index (Lorimer's index) measurements were made. Percent transmittance measurements on an overcast day (l-h average), transmittance measured over periods of 3 h or longer on a clear day, LAI-2000 diffuse noninterceptance measurements, and gap light index determined from fisheye photographs were strongly correlated with growing season percent transmittance (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.96) as was competition index (r(2) = 0.928). Concave spherical densiometer measurements and midday percent transmittance measurements on clear days were also well correlated with measured percent transmittance (r(2) greater than or equal to 0.89). Estimates of understory light by the LITE model were strongly correlated with growing season percent transmittance. Correlations improved with increasing length of the period simulated (r(2) = 0.755 for a point measurement on a clear day; r(2) = 0.936 for an entire sunny day; and, r(2) = 0.953 for the entire growing season). However, this version of the model underestimated percent transmittance in these spaced birch stands by 34-90%.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;100 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;104 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coen, SE</author><author>Oliffe, JL</author><author>Johnson, JL</author><author>Kelly, MT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Looking for Mr. PG: Masculinities and men's depression in a northern resource-based Canadian community</title><secondary-title>HEALTH &amp; PLACE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HEALTH &amp; PLACE</full-title></periodical><pages>94-101</pages><volume>21</volume><keywords><keyword>Depression</keyword><keyword>Gender</keyword><keyword>Masculinities</keyword><keyword>Men's health</keyword><keyword>Rural mental health</keyword><keyword>RURAL MENTAL-HEALTH</keyword><keyword>SOCIAL GEOGRAPHIES</keyword><keyword>STIGMA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1353-8292,1873-2054</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.healthplace.2013.01.011</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research has attributed the 'silent suffering' of men with depression to the influences of dominant masculine ideals such as strength and stoicism. Similarly, rural ideals - romanticized notions about rural places - have been shown to mute mental health issues and create barriers to help-seeking. This article examines the experiences of men with depression in Prince George, a northern resource-based community in British Columbia, Canada. Findings reveal how depressed men and their female partners enacted strategies to positively reinforce men's gendered sense of self, in a context that otherwise may render them out of place'. While favouring men's wellbeing, these strategies can also perpetuate an invisible geography of men's depression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The objectives of this study were to describe the prevalence of having been apprehended into the child welfare system and associated HIV vulnerabilities among young Indigenous people who use drugs. METHODS: The Cedar Project is a cohort of young Indigenous people ages 14-30 years who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. Multivariable logistic regression modeling determined associations between a history of involvement in the child welfare system and vulnerability to HIV infection. RESULTS: Of 605 participants, 65% had been taken from their biological parents. Median age of first apprehension was 4 years old. Having been sexually abused, having a parent who attended residential school and being HIV-positive were all independently associated with having been involved in the child welfare system. Participants who had been involved in the child welfare system were also more likely to have been homeless, paid for sex, diagnosed and hospitalized with mental illness, self-harmed, thought about suicide, and attempted suicide. Among participants who used injection drugs, those who had been involved in child welfare were more likely to have shared needles and overdosed. CONCLUSION: This study has found compelling evidence that young Indigenous people who use drugs in two cities in BC are experiencing several distressing health outcomes associated with child welfare involvement, including HIV infection. Jurisdictional reforms and trauma-informed programs that use culture as intervention are urgently needed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Clague, JJ</author><author>Roberts, NJ</author><author>Miller, B</author><author>Menounos, B</author><author>Goehring, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A huge flood in the Fraser River valley, British Columbia, near the Pleistocene Termination</title><secondary-title>GEOMORPHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOMORPHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>283-310</pages><volume>374</volume><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>COAST MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>DEPOSITS</keyword><keyword>DEGLACIATION</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN</keyword><keyword>SEDIMENTS</keyword><keyword>CORDILLERAN ICE-SHEET</keyword><keyword>ADVANCE</keyword><keyword>OUTBURST FLOODS</keyword><keyword>ALLUVIAL FANS</keyword><keyword>Flood</keyword><keyword>Fraser Valley</keyword><keyword>Geomorphology</keyword><keyword>Glacial Lake Fraser</keyword><keyword>GLACIAL LAKE MISSOULA</keyword><keyword>Jokulhlaup</keyword><keyword>Pleistocene Termination</keyword><keyword>Sedimentology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-555X,1872-695X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2020.107473</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Near the Pleistocene Termination, a glacier-dammed lake in central British Columbia suddenly drained to the south along the Fraser River valley. Floodwater travelled 330 km down the valley to Hope, British Columbia, and from there to the west into the Salish Sea near Vancouver. The flood was caused by the failure of an ice dam formed by the terminus of glaciers flowing from the central Coast Mountains across the British Columbia Interior Plateau. The ice dam impounded several hundred cubic kilometres of water to a maximum elevation of about 810 m asl (above sea level); at its maximum, the lake at the ice dam was over 250 m deep. Geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for the flood includes streamlined boulder-strewn bars, gravel dune fields, and terraces sloping up Fraser and lowermost Thompson valleys, opposite the present direction of river flow. The gravel bars and flood terraces are underlain by sheets of massive to poorly sorted gravel containing large boulders and rip-up clasts of silt and till. Shortly after the flood, a landslide near the northern margin of the former glacier dam impounded water to an elevation of about 550 m asl. This lake emptied due to overflow and incision of the landslide dam. The outburst flood from glacial Lake Fraser and the subsequent draining of the landslide-dammed lake deeply incised the older sediment fill in Fraser Valley and transported much of this sediment into the protoSalish Sea west of Vancouver, British Columbia and Bellingham, Washington. TCN ages on flood-transported boulders at three localities along the flood path agree with radiocarbon ages on inferred flood layers in ODP cores collected from Saanich Inlet, a fiord on southern Vancouver Island, 80 km south-southwest of Vancouver.

This study explores risk factors of inconsistent condom use (during consensual sex) over time among participants in the Cedar Project, a prospective cohort study of indigenous young people living in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use drugs. Due to the serial measurements for each study subject, generalized estimating equations modeling with logit link was used to accommodate the temporal correlation within subjects. For young women, inconsistent condom use over time was predicted by having a recent STI (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.76, 95% confidence interval [CI] [1.12, 2.79]), smoking crack daily (AOR = 1.63, 95%CI [1.02, 2.61]), and having experienced recent sexual abuse (AOR = 2.07, 95%CI [1.20, 3.56]). Among young men, living in Prince George (AOR = 1.63, 95%CI [1.14, 2.39]) and daily crack smoking (AOR = 1.56, 95%CI [1.02, 2.40]) were associated with inconsistent condom use over time. Among participants who used injection drugs, inconsistent condom use was associated with smoking crack daily (AOR = 1.59, 95%CI [1.04, 2.43]) and sharing needles (AOR = 1.78, 95%CI [1.26, 2.51]). The availability and effectiveness of sexual health services must be prioritized for indigenous people, and the design of culturally safe sexual health programs requires the meaningful involvement of young indigenous people.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;57</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carswell, BRENDAN M.</author><author>Rea, ROY V.</author><author>Searing, GARY F.</author><author>Hesse, GAYLE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Towards building a speciesspecific risk model for mammal-aircraft strikes</title><secondary-title>Journal of Airport Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Airport Management</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Airport Management</abbr-1></periodical><pages>288-303</pages><volume>15</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>25.a Environment / Ecosystems</keyword><keyword>7.a Quantitative</keyword><keyword>3.b.vii Scientific dispute or advocacy</keyword><keyword>24.f Monitoring and evaluation</keyword><keyword>2.k General Public</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>25.b Community / Social Systems / Equity</keyword><keyword>8.e Workplace accidents or hazardous conditions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Wildlife strikes are a significant issue in the aviation industry, especially strikes with medium- to large-sized mammals, which pose a high risk of damage to aircraft and human safety. Despite the identified threat that mammals can pose to aircraft, few works have been published on ways to rank and predict the risk of mammalian species to aircraft. This study used remote camera trap data collected from an array of wildlife camera traps at the Prince George International Airport (YXS), Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, to calculate strike risk for various species of mammals involved in runway incidents between January 2012 and December 2018. Carnivores such as red foxes and coyotes were found to be the highest risk mammal species at YXS, but foxes were found airside infrequently compared to coyotes. Binary logistic regression modelling was used in an attempt to predict variables leading to runway incidents with coyotes at YXS. The highest supported logistic regression model predicting coyote incidents included the variables ‘weekday’, ‘month’ and ‘season’. Although data from camera traps did not help to predict incidents, trend data collected from camera traps mirrored coyote incident data, suggesting that camera traps are useful for capturing times of the day and seasons of the year in which coyotes are active at the airport. Suggestions are provided as to how cameras might be used to track the movement of animals more accurately and what other data could be useful in helping to build risk assessments and models to predict aircraft incidents with mammals of interest.</abstract><research-notes>&#xD;&#xD;PG&#xD;&#xD;</research-notes><remote-database-name>IngentaConnect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/hsp/cam/2021/00000015/00000003/art00008</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carson, AW</author><author>Rea, RV</author><author>Fredeen, AL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extent of stem dieback in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) as an indicator of time-since simulated browsing</title><secondary-title>RANGELAND ECOLOGY &amp; MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>RANGELAND ECOLOGY &amp; MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>543-547</pages><volume>60</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>cattle</keyword><keyword>clipping</keyword><keyword>meristem</keyword><keyword>moose</keyword><keyword>plant response</keyword><keyword>stem necrosis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1550-7424,1551-5028</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2111/1551-5028(2007)60[543:EOSDIT]2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Simulated browsing treatments were imposed on an important browse species of the North American moose (Alces alces L.) to see if the development and extent of subsequent stem dieback in trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.) could be used to determine the time of browsing during the growing season. Two hundred naturally growing aspen saplings of similar size and form were randomly selected in a 20-ha area near the endowment lands of the University of Northern British Columbia, Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Plants were randomly assigned to treatment categories so that the apical meristems of 50 plants each were assigned to a control or were clipped on one of the following dates 6 weeks apart: 1 June, 16 July, and 30 August 2005. The leader of each aspen was clipped and dieback was left to progress until the onset of winter dormancy. Our results showed that the earlier the simulated browsing occurs in the growing season, the greater the length of stem dieback, up to the maximum of the subapical axillary node below the point of clipping. The average rate at which dieback progressed varied between treatments and decreased throughout the growing season. Our results suggest that the ratio of the actual length of stem dieback to the overall length of stem between the clip point and the subapical axillary node serves as a good indicator for estimating the time at which aspen meristems have been browsed during the growing season.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Carson, A</author><author>Chabot, C</author><author>Greyson, D</author><author>Shannon, K</author><author>Duff, P</author><author>Shoveller, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A narrative analysis of the birth stories of early-age mothers</title><secondary-title>SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH &amp; ILLNESS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIOLOGY OF HEALTH &amp; ILLNESS</full-title></periodical><pages>816-831</pages><volume>39</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>EXPERIENCES</keyword><keyword>adolescent pregnancy</keyword><keyword>ADOLESCENTS</keyword><keyword>birth</keyword><keyword>CHILDBIRTH</keyword><keyword>CONSTRUCTION</keyword><keyword>early-age motherhood</keyword><keyword>INFANT-MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>narrative</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0141-9889,1467-9566</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1467-9566.12518</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The telling of birth stories (i.e. stories that describe women's experiences of giving birth) is a common and important social practice. Whereas most research on birth narratives reflects the stories of middle-class, adult' women, we examine how the birth stories told by early-age mothers interconnect with broader narratives regarding social stigma and childbearing at too early' an age. Drawing on narrative theory, we analyse in-depth interviews with 81 mothers (ages 15-24years) conducted in Greater Vancouver and Prince George, Canada, in 2014-15. Their accounts of giving birth reveal the central importance of birth narratives in their identity formation as young mothers. Participants' narratives illuminated the complex interactions among identity formation, social expectations, and negotiations of social and physical spaces as they narrated their experiences of labour and birth. Through the use of narrative inquiry, we examine the ways in which re-telling the experience of giving birth serves to situate young mothers in relation to their past and future selves. These personal stories are also told in relation to a meta-narrative regarding social stigma faced by teenage' mothers, as well as the public's gaze' on motherhood in general - even within the labour and delivery room.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caron, RM</author><author>Samson, C</author><author>Bates, M</author><author>Chouteau, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Correcting airborne gravity data for overburden thickness: a case study from the Nechako interior plateau, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>483-492</pages><volume>56</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>SEDIMENTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2017-0209</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Large areas of bedrock in Canada, such as in the interior plateau of British Columbia, are covered by a thick glacial overburden. Lateral variations in overburden thickness can create spurious anomalies in gravity data. These anomalies can be of a size and amplitude similar to those associated with mineral bodies and can be mistaken for them. A methodology is introduced that corrects gravity data for changes in overburden thickness through the use of a bedrock topography map created by integrating information from a helicopter transient electromagnetic survey with geological survey data, well water data, and gravel pit locations. The approach is tested for a 68 km x 38 kin area in the prospective Nechako interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. The methodology extends the traditional Bouguer corrections by taking into account the gravitational contribution of the overburden. Results show that the capability of an airborne survey to detect a change in overburden thickness depends primarily on survey line spacing and to a lesser extent on the level of random noise in the gravity data. The bedrock topography correction has the capability of removing the gravitational attraction of overburden for the purpose of revealing, through interpretation, geological structures in the gravity data that originate from the bedrock and are otherwise concealed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cargo, WH</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Velocity readings, key to successful predictive maintenance system at Prince George pulp and paper limited</title><secondary-title>PULP AND PAPER MAGAZINE OF CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP AND PAPER MAGAZINE OF CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>88-94</pages><volume>72</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>1971</year><pub-dates><date>1971</date></pub-dates></dates><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Capron, A</author><author>Feau, N</author><author>Heinzelmann, R</author><author>Barnes, I</author><author>Benowicz, A</author><author>Bradshaw, RE</author><author>Dale, A</author><author>Lewis, KJ</author><author>Owen, TJ</author><author>Reich, R</author><author>Ramsfield, TD</author><author>Woods, AJ</author><author>Hamelin, RC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Signatures of Post-Glacial Genetic Isolation and Human-Driven Migration in the Dothistroma Needle Blight Pathogen in Western Canada</title><secondary-title>PHYTOPATHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PHYTOPATHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>116-127</pages><volume>111</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>evolution</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>NORTHWEST</keyword><keyword>HISTORY</keyword><keyword>DIVERSITY</keyword><keyword>ENVIRONMENT</keyword><keyword>FOREST HEALTH</keyword><keyword>forest pathology</keyword><keyword>fungal pathogens</keyword><keyword>genomics</keyword><keyword>population biology</keyword><keyword>RANGE</keyword><keyword>SEPTOSPORUM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0031-949X,1943-7684</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1094/PHYTO-08-20-0350-FI</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many current tree improvement programs are incorporating assisted gene flow strategies to match reforestation efforts with future climates. This is the case for the lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia), the most extensively planted tree in western Canada. Knowledge of the structure and origin of pathogen populations associated with this tree would help improve the breeding effort. Recent outbreaks of the Dothistroma needle blight (DNB) pathogen Dothistroma septosporum on lodgepole pine in British Columbia and its discovery in Alberta plantations raised questions about the diversity and population structure of this pathogen in western Canada. Using genotyping-by-sequencing on 119 D. septosporum isolates from 16 natural pine populations and plantations from this area, we identified four genetic lineages, all distinct from the other DNB lineages from outside of North America. Modeling of the population history indicated that these lineages diverged between 31.4 and 7.2 thousand years ago, coinciding with the last glacial maximum and the postglacial recolonization of lodgepole pine in western North America. The lineage found in the Kispiox Valley from British Columbia, where an unprecedented DNB epidemic occurred in the 1990s, was close to demographic equilibrium and displayed a high level of haplotypic diversity. Two lineages found in Alberta and Prince George (British Columbia) showed departure from random mating and contemporary gene flow, likely resulting from pine breeding activities and material exchanges in these areas. The increased movement of planting material could have some major consequences by facilitating secondary contact between genetically isolated DNB lineages, possibly resulting in new epidemics.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;66</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campbell, KA</author><author>Hawkins, CDB</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of seed source and nursery culture on paper birch (Betula papyrifera) uprooting resistance and field performance</title><secondary-title>FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>425-433</pages><volume>196</volume><number>2-3</number><issue>2-3</issue><keywords><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>POPULATIONS</keyword><keyword>SEEDLINGS</keyword><keyword>RESPONSES</keyword><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>SPRUCE</keyword><keyword>SURVIVAL</keyword><keyword>PINE</keyword><keyword>DIFFERENT SOIL-MOISTURE</keyword><keyword>ground line diameter</keyword><keyword>INTERIOR</keyword><keyword>nursery practices</keyword><keyword>paper birch</keyword><keyword>root strength</keyword><keyword>seed source</keyword><keyword>stocktype</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1127,1872-7042</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.foreco.2004.04.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Little is known about the effect of seed source and nursery culture on the growth and performance of artificially regenerated paper birch planted in the field. In the summer of 2000, trees were vertically uprooted in Prince George, BC using a tripod and winch device to determine if seed source and nursery culture significantly affected the root strength of 5-year-old paper birch. Trees from a seed source in the Skeena region had the greatest uprooting resistance, and the most root biomass, but the least root strength compared to the other three seed sources tested. The Skeena trees may be exhibiting an adaptive strategy which provides maximum root reinforcement across a wide range of environments. Uprooting resistance was similar for the 415D stocktypes grown at Red Rock and Kalamalka nurseries. However, trees grown in 515A styroblock at Kalamalka had the least uprooting resistance and root biomass of all treatments. In addition, the relationship between uprooting resistance and ground line diameter was different between nurseries. The results of this study suggest that regardless of height and diameter leaving the nursery, seed source root resistance and growth continued to be impacted by nursery culture 5 years after planting.

We documented macrolichen diversity across three age-classes in forests of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone (i.e., ICHwk3 subzone) east of Prince George, British Columbia. Our objectives were to report changes in lichen communities with stand age, identify potential indicators of antiquity, and investigate the functional role of dominant species in the ecosystem. We identified 41 taxa, including 4 alectorioid lichens, 21 foliose chlorolichens, and 16 old-growth-associated chlorolichens and cyanolichens. Older forests supported more species than young or mature forests. The abundance of Lobaria pulmonaria (L.) Hoffm. was strongly correlated with this increase in diversity and may therefore be an appropriate indicator of stand age in the ICH. The increase in L. pulmonaria and other N-2-fixing cyanolichens with stand age may have significant implications for forest nitrogen budgets in the interior of British Columbia, where atmospheric nitrogen deposition is relatively low and biological N-2 fixation accounts for nearly all of the nitrogen lost to forest harvesting. We hope that this greater understanding of lichen ecology across age-classes will promote sustainable stewardship of the remaining old-growth forests of inland British Columbia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;55 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Campbell, D</author><author>Church, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconnaissance sediment budgets for Lynn Valley, British Columbia: Holocene and contemporary time scales</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>701-713</pages><volume>40</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>CORDILLERAN ICE-SHEET</keyword><keyword>LILLOOET RIVER BASIN</keyword><keyword>YIELD</keyword><keyword>YR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E03-012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Volumes of erosional and depositional landforms were estimated by reconnaissance methods in a steep, forested drainage basin in the Coast Mountains, British Columbia, to examine what insight might be gained into the sediment budget in the absence of direct measurements of sediment transfer processes. Sediment transfers in postglacial and contemporary time were inferred on hillslopes, from hillslopes to stream channels, and within stream channels. Data were collected by aerial photographic analysis and field observation. Postglacial sediment sources are major gullies created by debris slides and flows, failures in glaciolacustrine terraces, and stream channel degradation. Depositional landforms consist of talus slopes and colluvial and alluvial fans. Contemporary sediment sources include debris slides and flows in established gullies and minor processes on hillslopes. Debris slide and debris flow volumes were calculated, and other processes were estimated from regional values. Erosion rate averaged over postglacial time is 276 t.km(-2). a(-1) (0.15 mm.a(-1) surface lowering), with gullies and stream channel degradation contributing 170 and 82 t.km(-2)-a(-1), respectively. A terminal alluvial fan provides an independent check of the results. In contemporary time, erosion rates are calculated to be 350 t-km(-2). a(-1), with debris flows and slides contributing nearly all of this sediment. The contemporary rate is probably perturbed by recent land use history. Mass-movement processes appear to be the dominant mechanism of sediment transfer and, contributions from Pleistocene valley deposits have declined significantly during Holocene time.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cameron, EM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrogeochemistry of the Fraser River, British Columbia: Seasonal variation in major and minor components</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>209-225</pages><volume>182</volume><number>1-4</number><issue>1-4</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>ESTUARY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1694</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0022-1694(95)02924-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>For several years Environment Canada (EC) has carried out a program of water sampling at four stations along the Fraser River and at one station on each of its two principal tributaries, the Thompson and the Nechako. Samples collected at bi-weekly intervals have been analyzed by EC for major and some trace components. Seasonal variation in water composition mainly relates to changes in discharge, this being low during winter and high during early summer snowmelt. Dissolved constituents, Mg, Si, K, Ca, Sr, HCO3, SO4 and (NO3+NO2), show moderate variation, being least concentrated during maximum discharge, reflecting dilution of groundwater by melting snow. Factor analysis shows secondary seasonal variation for SO4, that is related to the importance of deep groundwater as a source, and for (NO3+NO2), precipitated with snow and released during snowmelt. Large amounts of Na and Cl are added in pulp mill effluent. A uniform flux of this effluent, superimposed on a highly variable river discharge, gives rise to greater seasonal variation for Na and Cl than other dissolved constituents. The trace constituents, Fe, Mn, Al, P and Sr, were analyzed by EC in unfiltered water samples by methods that extract the elements from suspended material. Except for Sr, these elements have a high partition factor in favor of suspended over dissolved phases; their results reflect seasonal changes in quantities of suspended material, which can vary by two orders of magnitude.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calvert, AJ</author><author>Talinga, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Deep seismic reflection constraints on Paleogene crustal extension in the south-central Intermontane belt, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>393-406</pages><volume>51</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>DEXTRAL STRIKE-SLIP</keyword><keyword>WESTERN UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>CACHE CREEK TERRANE</keyword><keyword>AGE CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>CONTINENTAL LITHOSPHERE</keyword><keyword>EOCENE VOLCANISM</keyword><keyword>FAULT SYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>NECHAKO BASIN</keyword><keyword>VELOCITY STRUCTURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2013-0142</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Following growth of the Canadian Cordillera during the Mesozoic, the southern Cordillera was subject to extension during the Paleocene and Eocene that correlated with widespread volcanic activity in south- central British Columbia, including across much of the Nechako- Chilcotin plateau. In 2008, Geoscience BC acquired 330 km of deep vibroseis reflection profiles on the plateau, mostly over the Stikinia arc terrane, but also over its eastern contact with the oceanic Cache Creek terrane. All seven seismic reflection lines reveal a strongly reflective lower crust that extends from 7 to 9 s down to the Moho, which is defined by the downward termination of reflectivity at 11- 12 s. In the uppermost crust, extension occurred by block faulting with faults soling into subhorizontal to shallowly dipping detachments above 10 km depth. Extension in the deeper upper and middle crust, which was partly controlled by antiforms likely related to earlier shortening, was accommodated on a network of anastomosing shear zones that sole out into the top of the reflective lower crust. The lower crustal reflections correlate with seismic P- wave velocities of 6.45- 6.98 km/ s, indicating that the reflective lower crust has a more mafic composition than the middle crust. As in other extensional settings, we suggest that this pervasive fabric of reflectors arises from the intrusion of mantle- derived basaltic magma into zones of ductile shearing, and that differentiation of these melts resulted in the widespread Paleocene to Eocene volcanism. Reflector dips indicate that extension was approximately east- west, consistent with north- northwest- trending horsts separated by basins filled with Paleocene to Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calvert, AJ</author><author>Hayward, N</author><author>Spratt, JE</author><author>Craven, JA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seismic reflection constraints on upper crustal structures in the volcanic-covered central Nechako basin, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1021-1037</pages><volume>48</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>EOCENE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E10-097</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In 2008, a Vibroseis seismic reflection survey was acquired by Geoscience BC across the eastern part of the volcanic-covered Nechako basin in central British Columbia, where Cretaceous sedimentary rocks have been exhumed along a NNW trend. Good signal penetration through the volcanic cover is indicated by lower crustal reflections at 8-12 s, which were recorded by the entire seismic survey. Comparison of the 2008 seismic survey with data from a previous survey indicates that the lack of reflectivity in the earlier surveys is generally representative of the subsurface geology. The seismic data show that similar to 1700 and similar to 2900 m thick sub-basins are present at the northern and southern ends of this trend, but the intervening Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous and relatively thin. The creation of a passive-roof duplex by Campanian or later low-angle thrusting is inferred within the thickest Cretaceous strata, but elsewhere faulting is likely related to Eocene extension or transtension. Seismic reflections are also recorded from folded volcanic stratigraphy, the base of the surface volcanic rocks, an underlying volcaniclastic stratigraphy, and intrusions projecting into a Quaternary volcanic cone. Seismic interpretation is complemented by coincident audiofrequency magnetotelluric surveys, from which faulting is inferred at offsets in a regional conductor. No regionally extensive stratigraphy can be identified within the seismic data, and the central Nechako basin appears to be a complex network of small, deformed sub-basins, rather than a single large basin.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Calvert, AJ</author><author>Andrews, GDM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>New geoscientific constraints on the hydrocarbon potential of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>V-IX</pages><volume>51</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>SEISMIC-REFLECTION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2014-0054</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Infestation by the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae, decimated the forests of central British Columbia from 1999 to 2012, severely impacting the forest industry of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau. In response, all levels of government recognized the value in developing other areas of economic activity, such as hydrocarbon and mineral exploitation, to support local economies. Exploration for resources beneath the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau has historically been constrained by Tertiary volcanic sequences and Quaternary glacial deposits that obscure the underlying geology and limit geophysical imaging. Thus, a coordinated program comprising additional geological mapping, borehole data analysis, and modern geophysical surveys of the area was initiated in 2006, with the objective of better defining the subsurface geology, solving problems of imaging through the complex near-surface, and developing improved regional geological and tectonic models. An initial set of papers arising from this fieldwork, which focused on issues relevant to mineral and hydrocarbon exploration, was published in June 2011 in a Special Issue of the Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences. This Introduction to the second "Mountain Pine Beetle" Special Issue summarizes a set of scientific papers that focus on topics more related to hydrocarbon exploration and the large-scale structure of the crust. The papers deal with the development, thickness, and present distribution of the most prospective Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, as well as characterizing the physical properties of the near-surface volcanic units.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Callaghan, RC</author><author>Strike, C</author><author>Kerr, T</author><author>Fischer, B</author><author>Buxton, J</author><author>Stevens, E</author><author>Taylor, L</author><author>Victor, JC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Increasing prevalence of cocaine as the primary detoxification diagnosis an-long admissions presenting with current intravenous drug use - A review of detoxification records from northern British Columbia, 1999-2005</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SANTE PUBLIQUE</full-title></periodical><pages>178-181</pages><volume>99</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>INJECTION</keyword><keyword>HIV-INFECTION</keyword><keyword>cocaine</keyword><keyword>intravenous</keyword><keyword>rural health services</keyword><keyword>substance abuse</keyword><keyword>treatment centers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4263,1920-7476</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF03405468</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Objectives: This study sought to document the trends in drug use among intravenous drug users (IDUs) in northern British Columbia, and to discuss the public health implications. Method: We conducted a 7-year medical-chart review of all IDU-related admissions (n=2072) to an inpatient alcohol and drug cletoxification centre in Prince George, British Columbia. Primary cletoxification diagnosis was modeled onto year of admission using generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: Our study demonstrated an increasing prevalence of cocaine as the primary cletoxification diagnosis in IDU-related admissions in northern BC, from 32% of all IDU admissions in 1999 to 64% in 2001, and then a relatively steady elevated rate of approximately 60% between 2001-2005. Conclusions: Given that needle exchange programs and other harm reduction services for IDUs in British Columbia are not readily available in many northern and rural areas, the risks associated with intravenous cocaine use among northern IDUs represent a serious public health challenge. Tailored harm reduction strategies should take into account the prominence of intravenous cocaine use as an HIV risk factor. In areas without well-established intravenous drug use monitoring programs, such as rural and remote areas, cletoxification treatment records may serve as important sentinels for changing drug use patterns among IDUs.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butt, ZA</author><author>Mak, S</author><author>Gesink, D</author><author>Gilbert, M</author><author>Wong, J</author><author>Yu, A</author><author>Wong, S</author><author>Alvarez, M</author><author>Chong, M</author><author>Buxton, J</author><author>Tyndall, M</author><author>Krajden, M</author><author>Janjua, NZ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applying core theory and spatial analysis to identify hepatitis C virus infection "core areas" in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF VIRAL HEPATITIS</full-title></periodical><pages>373-383</pages><volume>26</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>spatial analysis</keyword><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>SEXUALLY-TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS</keyword><keyword>CHLAMYDIA</keyword><keyword>core areas</keyword><keyword>GEOGRAPHIC EPIDEMIOLOGY</keyword><keyword>GONORRHEA</keyword><keyword>HCV infection</keyword><keyword>NEW-YORK</keyword><keyword>PUBLIC-HEALTH</keyword><keyword>SYPHILIS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1352-0504,1365-2893</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jvh.13043</electronic-resource-num><abstract>"Core areas" of transmission for bacterial sexually transmitted infections have been identified. However, it is unclear whether core areas apply to viral infections, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV). We used geographic mapping and spatial analysis to identify distinct core areas of HCV infection in British Columbia (BC) using the BC Hepatitis Testers Cohort (BC-HTC), 1990-2013. The BC-HTC includes all BC residents tested for HCV (similar to 1.5 million; 1990-2013). Core HCV infection areas were identified spatially and temporally for five time periods (1990-1993, 1994-1998, 1999-2003, 2004-2008 and 2009-2013) through thematic mapping, Kernel Density Estimation, Hotspot analysis and cluster analysis at the Census dissemination area level in ArcGIS and SatScan. HCV infection core areas were consistently identified. HCV core areas expanded from the downtown of major cities in different regions of BC (Metro Vancouver, Vancouver Island, and Northern BC; 1990-1998), to smaller cities in Metro Vancouver and Interior BC (2000 onwards). Statistically significant clusters, or hotspots, were also observed for downtown Vancouver, Northern BC (Prince George) and Vancouver Island from 1990 to 2008 with expansion to other urban areas in Metro Vancouver from 1990-2013. Statistically significant clusters persisted after adjustment for injection drug use, number of HCV tests, age, sex, material and social deprivation. Persistence of areas with high HCV diagnoses rates in Vancouver and Prince George supports the theory of core areas of HCV transmission. Identification of core areas can inform prevention, care and treatment programme interventions and evaluate their impact over time.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;59</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butler, RF</author><author>Gehrels, GE</author><author>Baldwin, SL</author><author>Davidson, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paleomagnetism and geochronology of the Ecstall pluton in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia: Evidence for local deformation rather than large-scale transport</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH</full-title></periodical><volume>107</volume><number>B1</number><issue>B1</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>DISPLACEMENT</keyword><keyword>WASHINGTON</keyword><keyword>ALUMINUM</keyword><keyword>CALIBRATION</keyword><keyword>Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>IN-HORNBLENDE BAROMETRY</keyword><keyword>NORTHWARD TRANSLATION</keyword><keyword>paleomagnetism</keyword><keyword>PRINCE-RUPERT</keyword><keyword>REGIONAL TILT</keyword><keyword>STUART BATHOLITH</keyword><keyword>tectonics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-9313,2169-9356</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001JB000270</electronic-resource-num><abstract>[1] Samples for geochronologic, geobarometric, and paleomagnetic analyses were collected across the northern portion of the Ecstall pluton southeast of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Al-inhornblende geobarometry indicates pressures from 740 +/- 10 to 840 +/- 30 MPa corresponding to crystallization depths of similar to25 to similar to30 km. U/Pb analyses of zircons from western, central, and eastern localities within the pluton yield crystallization ages of 91.5 +/- 1.0 Ma, 90.8 +/- 1.0 Ma, and 90.5 +/- 1.0 Ma, respectively. Rock magnetic experiments, reflected light microscopy, and thermal demagnetization behavior suggest that natural remanent magnetism is carried by low-Ti titanohematite. Unblocking temperatures of the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) are dominantly in the 560 degreesC to 630 degreesC range, with age of magnetization approximated by the 40Ar/39Ar hornblende ages of 84.2 +/- 0.10 Ma on the western margin and 76.4 +/- 0.6 Ma in the center of the pluton. Site-mean ChRM directions were isolated for paleomagnetic samples from 23 sites and are distributed along a small circle with subhorizontal axis at similar to340degrees azimuth. ChRM directions from the central portion of the pluton are concordant with the expected Cretaceous magnetic field direction, while ChRM directions from the western margin are discordant by &gt;70degrees. Folding of the Ecstall pluton, either during Late Cretaceous west directed thrust transport above the convex upward Prince Rupert Shear Zone or during younger deformation of the pluton and underlying shear zone, can account for the paleomagnetic data and is consistent with the geochronologic, geobarometric, and structural geologic observations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Buckell, E.

Specifically, this study evaluated the association of age, income, education, work status, disability, marital status, and immigrant status with previous use of screening mammography and Pap tests. Data was obtained from the 1994 National Population Health Survey, which contains a sample of 416 women from the Prince George area. A series of logistic regression analyses were used to distinguish ever versus never been screened as well as recency of previous screening. Participation rates in screening mammography in Prince George are comparatively high; however, no association was found between social factors and previous mammography use. This suggests women in Prince George are participating in mammography services regardless of social background. Participation rates in Pap test screening in Prince George are high and are similar to provincial averages; however, while a large percentage of women have been screened, this percentage varies across social groups. Immigrant women, single women, and women with less education are over represented among women who have never had a Pap test. In addition, older women are less likely to obtain a recent Pap test when compared to younger women. This study suggests that certain groups of women in northern British Columbia experience low participation in health services, resulting in a higher risk for poor health and a poor quality of life.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Broersma, K</author><author>Kline, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Nitrate nitrogen levels of Timothy, Reed Canarygrass and Meadow Foxtail with varying nitrogen-fertilizer treatments at Prince George</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>253-253</pages><volume>62</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1982</year><pub-dates><date>1982</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4220</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Brisbois, Ben</author><author>Hoogeveen, Dawn</author><author>Allison, Sandra</author><author>Cole, Donald</author><author>Fyfe, Trina M.</author><author>Harder, Henry G.</author><author>Parkes, Margot W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Storylines of research on resource extraction and health in Canada: A modified metanarrative synthesis</title><secondary-title>Social Science &amp; Medicine</secondary-title><short-title>Storylines of research on resource extraction and health in Canada</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Social Science &amp; Medicine</full-title></periodical><pages>1-14</pages><volume>277</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Breed, CA</author><author>Arocena, JM</author><author>Sutherland, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Possible sources of PM10 in Prince George (Canada) as revealed by morphology and in situ chemical composition of particulate</title><secondary-title>ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>1721-1731</pages><volume>36</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>principal component analysis</keyword><keyword>SEM-EDS</keyword><keyword>AREA</keyword><keyword>AEROSOL</keyword><keyword>DUST</keyword><keyword>episode</keyword><keyword>FLY-ASH</keyword><keyword>INDIVIDUAL PARTICLES</keyword><keyword>MATTER</keyword><keyword>MICROSCOPY</keyword><keyword>non-episode</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1352-2310</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1352-2310(01)00500-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The susceptibility of the Prince George airshed to incidence of high concentrations of particulate matter &lt; 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) has raised considerable concern because of potentia I health hazards. This study examined the utility of chemical and morphological characteristics of PM10 collected and archived by the BC Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks from three monitoring stations to determine the possible sources of PM10 during selected episodic and non-episodic events. Samples from three episodic events (24 h PM10 levels &gt; 50 mug m(-3)) and three non-episodic events (24 h PM10 levels &lt; 50 mug m(-3)) in 1995-1996 were examined using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive system. Results show that rounded. spherical and oval shaped particulate were diagnostic for combustion sources, while irregular-shaped particulate were dominant in all samples including road dust. The particulate size distributions indicated that combustion sources contributed more to &lt; 2.5 mum fraction while geologic material is responsible for particulate with diameter between 3 and 4 mum. Principal component analysis of in situ chemical composition suggests that high concentrations of aluminum, silicon and magnesium are indicative of geologic material while carbon. sodium and sulphur are indicative or combustion and industrial sources. Our study suggests that in Prince George. episodic events were influenced by geologic material while the non-episodic events are impacted by industrial, combustion and to some extent by geologic materials. We also found that the combined use of particulate morphology and elemental composition has a good potential to distinguish between geologic material and industrial, combustion sources of PM10 in the Prince George airshed.

We examined the spatial dynamics of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that spawn in 36 streams of the Stuart River watershed in British Columbia, Canada, using a 69-year record of spawner abundance and a demographically based Bayesian dynamic occupancy model. We identified a set of 12 streams with good habitat conditions that were occupied &gt;90% of years despite large year-to-year changes in abundance. Over 85% of spawners were concentrated in these streams. Many other streams with poorer habitat had small populations that were not persistent over time and were periodically recolonized by dispersers from other streams. Although it is often assumed population diversity and resiliency is maximized when all available habitats are used, for this salmon metapopulation, resiliency is due to the core streams of higher habitat quality. Currently, other streams make only small contributions to population abundance; however, some may have conservation value if their habitats become more suitable for spawning in the future.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;61</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bradford, MJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends in the Abundance of Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus-Tshawytscha) of the Nechaco river, British-Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>965-973</pages><volume>51</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>FRASER-RIVER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0706-652X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/f94-096</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Trends in abundance of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) of the Nechako River, a tributary of the Fraser River, were analyzed to quantify the ecological effects of water abstraction for electricity generation. In years when the majority of returning chinook adults used the upper Nechako River for spawning, the survival of offspring for the entire river was poorer than in years when spawning was concentrated in the lower reaches. Relative to the historical discharge, the upper Nechako River has experienced the greatest degree of water abstraction, and the lower survival of chinook broods originating from the upper river may be due to early emergence of fry caused by elevated fall and winter water temperatures or to higher rates of predation on juveniles and loss of rearing habitat caused by the elimination of the spring freshet. Poor recruitment resulting from broods spawning predominately in the upper river has caused the trend in the abundance of Nechako River chinook to diverge from the trend of chinook populations of similar life history from unregulated tributaries of the Fraser River. Additional reductions in flow may further affect the capacity of the upper Nechako River to produce chinook salmon.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bowles, P</author><author>Ajit, D</author><author>Dempsey, K</author><author>Shaw, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Urban Aboriginal use of fringe financial institutions: Survey evidence from Prince George, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SOCIO-ECONOMICS</full-title></periodical><pages>895-902</pages><volume>40</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Financial exclusion</keyword><keyword>Fringe banking</keyword><keyword>Payday loans</keyword><keyword>Urban Aboriginal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1053-5357</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.socec.2011.08.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper analyses the use of fringe financial institutions (FFIs), such as payday loan and check cashing providers, by urban Aboriginal people based on a survey undertaken in Prince George, British Columbia.

We find that government policy towards regulating the FFI industry is inadequate for meeting the basic financial needs of urban Aboriginal people. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Apatite in several porphyry copper deposits in British Columbia has a unique set of physical and compositional characteristics that can be used to evaluate the chemical conditions of magmas that formed the causative intrusions or associated hydrothermal alteration. Apatite under visible light and SEM shows no notable variations between unaltered and altered varieties but cathodoluminescence reveals significant differences. Apatite in unaltered rocks displays yellow, yellow-brown, and brown luminescence, whereas in K silicate-altered rocks apatite displays a characteristic green luminescence. The green-luminescent apatite replaces yellow-or brown-luminescent apatite and locally overgrows it. Apatite occurring with muscovite (i.e., phyllic)-altered rocks displays characteristic gray luminescence. The chemistry of apatite, as determined by electron microprobe and laser ICP-MS analyses, directly reflects its alteration and luminescence. The unaltered yellow-luminescent apatite has high concentrations of Mn (0.3-0.5 wt % MnO) and a high Mn/Fe ratio (&gt;1), whereas the brown-luminescent apatite has low Mn, but higher concentrations of S and REE + Y. The green K silicate alteration-related luminescence is caused by lower Mn/Fe ratios (ca. 1) along with depletions of other trace elements such as Cl, S, and Na. Gray-luminescent apatite occurring with muscovite-altered rocks results from significant Mn loss (&lt;0.15% MnO) contemporaneous with depletion in Na, S, Cl, and REE during low pH phyllic alteration in calc-alkalic porphyry deposits. The correlation between apatite texture, luminescence, and chemical composition with the type and intensity of porphyry alteration offers a potentially fast and effective method to utilize it as an indicator for porphyry mineralization in a range of exploration materials including soils, regoliths, and heavy mineral concentrates from glacial and fluvial materials.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;95 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;100 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;74</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bordet, E</author><author>Mihalynuk, MG</author><author>Hart, CJR</author><author>Mortensen, JK</author><author>Friedman, RM</author><author>Gabites, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chronostratigraphy of Eocene volcanism, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>56-103</pages><volume>51</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>AGE</keyword><keyword>PRECISION</keyword><keyword>U-PB</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2013-0073</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Onset and termination of Eocene felsic volcanism in the Chilcotin Plateau of central British Columbia is constrained between 54.6 and 46.6 Ma by 33 new U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic age determinations. Dates were obtained from representative felsic coherent and fragmental volcanic rocks that comprise the Ootsa Lake Group. The resulting chronostratigraphy shows that magma compositions evolved from felsic to intermediate, with no spatial migration of the volcanic activity. Rhyolitic compositions are oldest; and are overlain by dacitic rocks with varied phenocrysts assemblages. In many parts of the Chilcotin Plateau, the Eocene stratigraphy is capped by distinctive vitreous black dacite lavas, which are contemporaneous with andesitic lavas of the Endako Group in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Crystallization ages from Ootsa Lake Group rocks of the Chilcotin Plateau overlap age determinations from correlative rocks of the Nechako Plateau and southern BC. Collectively, this geochronological dataset supports previous suggestions of a voluminous Early Eocene-aged (similar to 55-46 Ma) period of volcanism in the Intermontane Belt. The abrupt initiation of volcanism, as well as the wide extent, thickness, and compositions that characterize Eocene volcanic rocks may be explained by cessation of subduction and formation of a slab gap beneath British Columbia in the Early Eocene.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Booth, AL</author><author>Ryan, DAJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A tale of two cities, with bears: understanding attitudes towards urban bears in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>URBAN ECOSYSTEMS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>URBAN ECOSYSTEMS</full-title></periodical><pages>961-973</pages><volume>22</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>PERCEPTIONS</keyword><keyword>Black bear management</keyword><keyword>BLACK BEARS</keyword><keyword>CONFLICTS</keyword><keyword>FOOD AVAILABILITY</keyword><keyword>Public attitudes towards wildlife</keyword><keyword>Urban wildlife</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1083-8155,1573-1642</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11252-019-00873-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The management of black bears (Ursus americanus) in urban and/or exurban settings is of growing concern as these mammals, along with coyotes, cougars and others, begin to re-colonize areas from which they had been extirpated. Urban and exurban landscapes can offer much needed habitat to these space-demanding creatures, thereby buffering habitat losses in other areas and protecting populations of these species, but only if conflicts between these animals and humans can be managed and minimized. In the case of urban black bears, they can become quickly labled as a "problem" bear if they become too reliant on human garbage or other food sources such as fruit trees. A "problem" bear usually becomes a dead bear. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, UNBC researchers undertook two surveys of Prince George over a 3 year period and a companion survey in the city of Coquitlam, BC to examine attitudes towards urban bears. The research found that residents of both cities, in spite of regular and close encounters with black bears, strongly supported the presence and preservation of bears within an urban setting, largely due to conservation concerns.

In 2019, we examined public perceptions toward cats within the City of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, using an online survey (1,464 responses) to assess perceptions toward free-roaming cats and the use of bylaws to address concerns. Perceptions were dependent on cat-ownership status; a majority of non-cat and former owners were concerned about free-roaming cats, current cat owners less so. There was considerable support for mandatory identification. Cat owners were not supportive of bylaws restricting free-roaming of cats, although this was supported by non-owners. Concerns include the negative impact on caring for a pet cat, and the fear that such bylaws would increase abandonment. Cat owners were not enthusiastic about fines for roaming cats, while non-cat owners were. There was considerable concern around including neutering cats as part of planned cat management. Our research also found nuanced concern for the impacts of management on impoverished owners, the welfare of cats and a recognition that it was the humans, rather than the cats, who should be the focus of active and thoughtful intervention.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Booth, A</author><author>Earley, S</author><author>Aben, K</author><author>Otter, B</author><author>Corrigal, T</author><author>Ray, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Action learning partnerships: carbon, commerce and community co-learning at a Canadian university</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABILITY IN HIGHER EDUCATION</full-title></periodical><pages>943-957</pages><volume>21</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>Action learning</keyword><keyword>Carbon footprinting</keyword><keyword>Climate change education</keyword><keyword>Community-university partnerships</keyword><keyword>EDUCATION</keyword><keyword>PEDAGOGY</keyword><keyword>SCHOLARSHIP</keyword><keyword>SUSTAINABILITY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1467-6370,1758-6739</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/IJSHE-02-2020-0071</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose The purpose of this paper is to discuss an innovative course offered as a partnership between the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC) (Canada), the Prince George Chamber of Commerce (Canada) and local businesses: UNBC's third-year undergraduate/graduate course, carbon and energy management. Design/methodology/approach The authors have all participated in the development, design and/or delivery of the course and have provided their reflections on the experience. In addition, they sought insights from students and other interested people on the impact and significance of this course. Findings Carbon and energy management is an action learning-based co-created course initiated by the Chamber to address an interest in mitigating climate change amongst local businesses. Among businesses, the carbon economy is under considerable discussion. The increased awareness of climate change, and the need to better manage carbon, has led to local businesses eager to reduce greenhouse gases but lacking the expertise necessary. UNBC students (undergraduate and graduate) learn innovative and practical skills through creating carbon footprint analyses for small- to medium-sized business/non-profit clients, providing recommendations on reducing reliance on fossil fuels and formally presenting their findings to their clients. After five years, 46 businesses and non-profit organizations have participated in the course along with over 30 students and 5 separately hired student interns. The Chamber is now rolling out the program for Canadian Chamber of Commerce interested in similar community-university partnerships. Originality/value This paper describes a course that is a novel approach to university-community partnerships, both in approach and focus area. The linking, through the course, of small- to medium-sized businesses with the provision of plans for carbon reduction developed by university students is an unusual approach. However, there is significant value to all partners in the approach. Allowing the main community partner to serve as the lead in the project also offers an unusual experience and perspective for the university partner, as often such partnerships are largely driven by the post-secondary institution's interests and needs, which can create a challenging power dynamic. Instead, the course offers a lesson in how a university can be clearly in service to the community at the community's invitation. Finally, this paper offers reflections on the value of this type of project for creating sustainability initiatives from the perspective of all participants, students, faculty, university administration, city government, participating businesses and the Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating the critical need for understanding a project as an intersection of all participating actors.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bomke, AA</author><author>Lowe, LE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trace-element uptake by 2 British-Columbia forages as affected by poultry manure application</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>305-312</pages><volume>71</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BARLEY</keyword><keyword>COPPER</keyword><keyword>LADINO CLOVER</keyword><keyword>MICRONUTRIENTS</keyword><keyword>ORCHARDGRASS</keyword><keyword>SOILS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4271</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4141/cjss91-030</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Field experiments evaluated yield response to deep-pit poultry manure application to barley on a clay soil near Prince George and a grass-legume forage on a silty clay loam soil near Chilliwack, B.C.

Crime rates are the most usual measure of the volume of criminality at a given time or a given place. Statistics Canada recently developed a Crime Severity Index to account for variations in the seriousness of police-recorded criminal infractions. A close look at its construction reveals that the Index is a weighted rate influenced by both the volume and the seriousness of recorded infractions. This article introduces a new indicator designed to measure the seriousness of recorded infractions. The measure is based on simple calculations and easy to interpret. It suggests that serious crime has decreased since the 1980s. It also suggests that city and province rankings based solely on crime rates are misleading because high levels of crime do not necessarily indicate high levels of the more serious crimes.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bloom, MS</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chemistry of inclusion fluids-Stockwork Molybdenum Depostis from Questa, New Mexico, and Hudson-Bay Mountain and Endako, British-Columbia.</title><secondary-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECONOMIC GEOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>1906-1920</pages><volume>76</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><dates><year>1981</year><pub-dates><date>1981</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0361-0128</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2113/gsecongeo.76.7.1906</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blewett, J</author><author>Hanlon, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Disablement as inveterate condition: Living with habitual ableism in Prince George, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>46-55</pages><volume>60</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>DISABILITY</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>PLACE</keyword><keyword>place</keyword><keyword>GEOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>ACCESS</keyword><keyword>Colombie-Britannique</keyword><keyword>disablement</keyword><keyword>entretiens en situation</keyword><keyword>go-along interviews</keyword><keyword>INCLUSION</keyword><keyword>invalidite</keyword><keyword>lieu</keyword><keyword>SOCIAL EXCLUSION</keyword><keyword>ville hivernale</keyword><keyword>WELFARE</keyword><keyword>winter-city</keyword><keyword>WORK</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12254</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Working within the sub-discipline of the Geographies of (dis)Ability, this article employs a mixed-method approachusing go-along interviews and barrier identification to explore disablement in the City of Prince George, a resource-centred city in British Columbia's northern interior. We shed light on how various habituations of ableism (e.g., inattention to accessibility planning, inadequate and weakly enforced building codes) are implicated in the disablement of individuals. In particular, we focus on ways in which the production of Prince George as a resource-centred, winter city reproduces inaccessibility in the landscape, as revealed in the experiences and impressions of residents living with impairment. The approach presented in this article offers unique insights into disablement as it has taken place in and through this remote, northern city. La condition permanente de l'invalidite: vivre au quotidien avec le capacitisme a Prince George, Colombie-BritanniquePartant de la sous-discipline des geographies de l'incapacite, cet article repose sur une approche methodologique mixte qui comprend des entretiens en situation et une demarche d'identification d'obstacles, en vue de realiser une etude sur l'invalidite a Prince George, une ville d'extraction de ressources situee dans la partie continentale nord de la Colombie-Britannique. Ces travaux visent a elucider les diverses insensibilisations face au capacitisme (par exemple, le manque d'interet pour l'amenagement de l'accessibilite, les codes de construction inadequats et peu appliques) et comment celles-ci ont des consequences directes sur l'invalidite des individus. Il est question plus particulierement des moyens par lesquels la production de Prince George en tant que &lt;&lt; ville hivernale &gt;&gt; d'extraction de ressources confere au milieu un caractere d'inaccessibilite, tel que manifeste a travers l'experience et les impressions de residents vivant avec un handicap.

This risk will increase over time as a result of climate change because of higher average temperatures, longer growing seasons, and more intense droughts. On the other hand, these communities are also faced with rising fuel costs and a growing demand for heat as suburban population increases. The fact these communities are surrounded by forests presents an opportunity to combine community wildfire risk abatement with bioenergy development. Additional co-benefits include: (1) reduced community energy expenditures; (2) the creation of local jobs; (3) climate change mitigation; and (4) increased community energy security. Here, we present results from three pilot rural communities (Burns Lake, Invermere, and Sicamous, all of them in British Columbia) designed to evaluate the feasibility of wildfire risk abatement in conjunction with bioenergy production. Maps were created showing each community's forest-urban interface area with quantified estimates of its sustainable woody biomass resource potential under different management scenarios while monitoring ecosystem and soil health. The results and experience gained through this work has been synthesized in a calculator tool to help other communities make their own screening-level assessments.

The landslide was initiated in a succession of sub-horizontal competent mafic basalts (Endako Formation) capping weaker felsic volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (Ootsa Lake Group) of Eocene age. Several landslides have been observed in similar volcanic successions worldwide including in southern British Columbia. Some common characteristics of these landslides are: structurally undisturbed; horizontal to sub-horizontal bedding; curved head scarp; steep joints; debris consists of intact blocks; volcaniclastics containing smectite (expandable clay mineral); fossils and lignite within the volcaniclastics. The Sutherland landslide is one of many large landslides that have occurred in recent years in northern British Columbia. At least eight other large landslides have been triggered in volcanic rocks within the Nechako plateau.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Blais-Stevens, A</author><author>Behnia, P</author><author>Kremer, M</author><author>Page, A</author><author>Kung, R</author><author>Bonham-Carter, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Landslide susceptibility mapping of the Sea to Sky transportation corridor, British Columbia, Canada: comparison of two methods</title><secondary-title>BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BULLETIN OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>447-466</pages><volume>71</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>SCALE</keyword><keyword>HAZARD</keyword><keyword>MODELS</keyword><keyword>Debris flows</keyword><keyword>Fuzzy logic method</keyword><keyword>INFORMATION</keyword><keyword>Landslide susceptibility</keyword><keyword>MAP</keyword><keyword>Qualitative heuristic method</keyword><keyword>REGION</keyword><keyword>Rockfalls/slides</keyword><keyword>Sea to Sky corridor</keyword><keyword>TURKEY</keyword><keyword>ZONATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1435-9529</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10064-012-0421-z</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Sea to Sky corridor stretches over a distance of 135 km into British Columbia's Coast Mountains. The corridor has witnessed hundreds of historical and pre-historic landslides. In the last 154 years, 155 landslide events have been reported. The most common types of landslides are rockfalls and debris flows, which are small in volume, but can be quite damaging. These are more abundant in the southern part of the corridor where infrastructure is built close to steep slopes. Two different methods were adapted to create debris flow and rockfall/rock slide susceptibility maps. Both qualitative heuristic and fuzzy logic susceptibility maps showed a similar distribution of susceptibility zones, especially high susceptibility. Correlation of high susceptibility zones with occurrence of historical and mapped geological landslide events was very good. Success rate curves were calculated for extrapolated zones of initiation for debris flow and rockfall/rock slide deposits. Success rate curves were better for debris flow than rockfall/rockslide maps.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;50</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bewley, D</author><author>Alila, Y</author><author>Varhola, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability of snow water equivalent and snow energetics across a large catchment subject to Mountain Pine Beetle infestation and rapid salvage logging</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>464-479</pages><volume>388</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>Forest hydrology</keyword><keyword>Snow</keyword><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>ACCUMULATION</keyword><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>BOREAL FOREST</keyword><keyword>Mountain Pine Beetle</keyword><keyword>ABLATION</keyword><keyword>BALANCE</keyword><keyword>Catchment scale</keyword><keyword>CLEAR-CUT</keyword><keyword>CONIFEROUS FOREST</keyword><keyword>Distributed modelling</keyword><keyword>RADIATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1694,1879-2707</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2010.05.031</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examines the effect on stand and catchment scale snow processes due to widespread forest disturbance by the Mountain Pine Beetle (MPB; Dendroctonus ponderosae) infestation, for the 1570 km(2) Baker Creek catchment in the B.C. interior where all healthy mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) stands which dominated the catchment up until 2000 have since died or been salvage logged. Measurements in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this net canopy reduction has reduced peak snowpack and melt rate differences between remaining stands (including large clearcuts, younger regenerating stands and dead mature pine stands), relative to a healthy forest canopy with smaller clearcuts. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was calibrated and run at 200 m resolution across the catchment, and simulated snowmelt rates and snow-covered area compared relatively well to distributed satellite or ground-based measurements. Snowpack and ablation rates were 10-20% higher during the 2008 and 2009 winters than when running the model for the pre-MPB landscape in 2000 using the same input meteorological data, resulting in almost no difference in the snowcover period. A greater snowpack volume which enters the stream network faster inevitably has implications for streamflows, flood risks and water resources, and these are assessed during the next stage of this research project.

Teng causes Tomentosus root disease in spruce trees throughout the boreal and sub-boreal forests of British Columbia. Site and soil characteristics are related to the incidence of this fungus in wet, cool sub-boreal spruce forests located near prince George, British Columbia. Two-hundred and ninety-six plots, 25.2 m in diameter, were examined to determine the incidence of I. tomentosus, and several sire and soil variables were measured. These included soil moisture and nutrient regime, slope position, soil texture, soil coarseness, humus form, spruce density, tree species composition and soil pH. The incidence of I, tomentosus infection ranged from none to 31% of spruce trees per plot. Significant differences (p &lt; 0.05) in percent infection were found between soil moisture regimes, soil moisture by soil nutrient regimes, and slope position. All of these site and soil variables are used, in British Columbia, to determine a 'site series', which is a site specific ecological classification unit used to determine harvest methods and silviculture prescriptions. The most important site variable influencing disease incidence is suggested to be soil moisture regime as influenced by slope position and soil texture. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Watersheds over which multiple observation types are available can potentially further benefit from data assimilation by having multiple updated states from which hydrologic predictions can be generated. However, the magnitude and time span of the impact of the assimilation of an observation varies according not only to its type, but also to the variables included in the state vector. This study examines the impact of multivariate synthetic data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the spatially distributed hydrologic model CEQUEAU for the mountainous Nechako River located in British Columbia, Canada. Synthetic data include daily snow cover area (SCA), daily measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) at three different locations and daily streamflow data at the watershed outlet. Results show a large variability of the continuous rank probability skill score over a wide range of prediction horizons (days to weeks) depending on the state vector configuration and the type of observations assimilated. Overall, the variables most closely linearly linked to the observations are the ones worth considering adding to the state vector due to the limitations imposed by the EnKF. The performance of the assimilation of basin-wide SCA, which does not have a decent proxy among potential state variables, does not surpass the open loop for any of the simulated variables. However, the assimilation of streamflow offers major improvements steadily throughout the year, but mainly over the short-term (up to 5 days) forecast horizons, while the impact of the assimilation of SWE gains more importance during the snowmelt period over the mid-term (up to 50 days) forecast horizon compared with open loop. The combined assimilation of streamflow and SWE performs better than their individual counter-parts, offering improvements over all forecast horizons considered and throughout the whole year, including the critical period of snowmelt. This highlights the potential benefit of using multivariate data assimilation for streamflow predictions in snow-dominated regions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bennett, J</author><author>Garant, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Bleach plant and screen room modernization</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>27-32</pages><volume>107</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>bleach plants</keyword><keyword>kraft mills</keyword><keyword>modernization</keyword><keyword>performance evaluation</keyword><keyword>screen rooms</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><abstract>Prince George Pulp produces 800 t/d of softwood Kraft paper and market Kraft pulp, as unbleached or semi-bleached product.

Far-infrared sauna treatments improve the quality of life for those with chronic pain, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and congestive heart failure. The objective of this study is to determine whether far-infrared saunas have a beneficial effect on quality of life in those with type II diabetes. Design: This was a sequential, longitudinal, interrupted time series design study. Setting/location: The setting was Fraser Lake BC, a rural village in central British Columbia, Canada. Subjects: All patients of the Fraser Lake Community Health Center with type II diabetes were invited to participate in this study. Interventions: The study consisted of 20-minute, 3 times weekly infrared sauna sessions, over a period of 3 months. Outcome measures: To assess quality of life, subjects completed the 36-item Short-form Health Survey Version 2 (SF-36v2) questionnaire as well as "Zero-to-Ten'' Visual Analogue Scales. Baseline study parameters were measured within 1 week prior to commencing sauna sessions. Postintervention measurements were collected between 1 and 3 days after the last sauna session. Results: Physical health, general health, and social functioning indices of the SF-36v2 improved. Visual Analogue Scales for stress and fatigue improved. Conclusions: Far-infrared sauna use maybe associated with improved quality of life in people with type II diabetes mellitus. Uptake of infrared saunas use is greater than the uptake of other lifestyle interventions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bedford, L</author><author>Sutton, RF</author><author>Stordeur, L</author><author>Grismer, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Establishing white spruce in the Boreal White and Black Spruce zone - Site preparation trials at Wonowon and Iron Creek, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>NEW FORESTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NEW FORESTS</full-title></periodical><pages>213-233</pages><volume>20</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>blading</keyword><keyword>disk trenching</keyword><keyword>fertilization</keyword><keyword>GLAUCA MOENCH VOSS</keyword><keyword>herbicide</keyword><keyword>mounding</keyword><keyword>patch scarification</keyword><keyword>plantation establishment</keyword><keyword>plowing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-4286</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1006774518199</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two trials ("Wonowon'' and "Iron Creek'') in the Prince George Forest Region of interior British Columbia were begun in the mid 1980s to evaluate site preparation treatments for establishing white spruce (Picea glauca [Moench] Voss) in the Boreal White and Black Spruce biogeoclimatic zone. The 14 treatments (9 or 10 per trial) were: [B.C.] Ministry, Sinkkila, and Bracke mounds; Bracke mounds manually supplemented with 20-, 14-, or 6-cm cappings of mineral soil; fertilized Sinkkila mounds; Bracke patches; fertilized Bracke patches; bladed strips; plowed ground; herbicide; and untreated controls, separately with both standard and nominally superior "alternate'' planting stock. With minor aberrations, each trial consists of 5 randomized complete blocks each with one 80-tree plot per treatment; planting was in spring, 1984 at Wonowon, 1987 at Iron Creek. All trees in mounding treatments and the inner 48 trees in other plots were monitored for performance through 1998 at Wonowon, 1996 at Iron Creek. The herbicide and plowing treatments, and mounds capped thickly enough with mineral soil to inhibit weed regrowth, were clearly superior to others. In the mounding treatments at Wonowon, survival rate increased with capping thickness, but, while the 14 and 20 cm cappings were best, significant differences among them were few after 15 growing seasons. In both trials, patch scarification gave poorer results than did planting without site preparation.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beckers, J</author><author>Alila, Y</author><author>Mtiraoui, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the validity of the British Columbia Forest Practices Code guidelines for stream culvert discharge design</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</full-title></periodical><pages>684-692</pages><volume>32</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BASIN-SCALE</keyword><keyword>DISTRIBUTIONS</keyword><keyword>FLOOD PEAKS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/X02-010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the stream culvert discharge design guidelines of the Forest Practices Code (FPC) of British Columbia (BC), the 100-year instantaneous flood (Q(100)) is assumed to be three times as large as the mean annual flood (Q(2)) regardless of basin characteristics and location in the province. A regional linear moment analysis of annual maximum flows is used to demonstrate that this assumption is invalid and that Q(100)/Q(2) ratios vary substantially with basin area and climate. For the snowmelt-dominated peak flows in the Columbia and southern Rocky Mountains, Q(100)/Q(2) decreases slightly with increasing drainage area, from 2.3 (1 km(2)) to 1.9 (100 km(2)). For the flood peaks generated by rainfall and rain on snow in coastal BC, this range is 3.1-2.6. In the semi-arid Interior Plateau region, variability in Q(100)/Q(2) ratios is most dramatic. For a 10-km(2) basin, the calculated Q(100)/Q(2) ratio of 4.9 is 1.6 times the assumed factor of 3, while for a 1-km(2) basin Q(100)/Q(2) is 7.5 or 2.5 times this factor. Underestimating Q(100)/Q(2) may lead to underdesign and early failure of road culverts, and therefore, current FPC guidelines for estimating the 100-year instantaneous flood may have serious adverse economic and environmental consequences in small Interior Plateau watersheds.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrie, CT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Petrochemistry of Shoshonitic rocks associated with porphyry copper-gold deposits of Central Quesnellia, British-Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOCHEMICAL EXPLORATION</full-title></periodical><pages>225-258</pages><volume>48</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>VOLCANIC-ROCKS</keyword><keyword>CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>ARC</keyword><keyword>TRACE-ELEMENTS</keyword><keyword>HYDROTHERMAL ALTERATION</keyword><keyword>LAVAS</keyword><keyword>LIHIR-ISLAND</keyword><keyword>NORANDA-DISTRICT</keyword><keyword>PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA</keyword><keyword>PRIMARY MAGMAS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0375-6742</isbn><abstract>Major and trace element petrochemistry has been determined for forty-six Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rocks representing the Mt. Milligan and Chuchi porphyry Cu-Au deposits, marginal phases of the Hogem Batholith, and Takla Group volcanic rocks. Monzonites and latites of the Mt. Milligan deposit have undergone moderate to strong potassic alteration, principally involving the addition of K-feldspar and biotite. They are characterized by high K2O (5-13 wt.%), low Sr (180-450 ppm), high LOI (3-7 wt.%), slight to moderate LREE enrichment (La(N)/SM(N) = 3.9, n = 5 for monzonites, La(N)/Sm(N) = 2.4, n = 5 for volcanic rocks); but have non-diagnostic compatible trace element, HREE and HFSE contents in comparison to less altered rocks in the region. Samples taken peripheral to the Chuchi deposit have undergone moderate potassic (K-feldspar) alteration. They have slightly enriched K2O (4-6 wt.%) and LREE (La(N)/Sm(N) = 3.0, n = 4 for monzonites; La(N)/Sm(N) = 2.7, n = 4 for volcanic rocks), but otherwise are similar to less-altered rocks nearby. An alteration index: K2O x 100/Sr, distinguishes mineralized from barren samples in this suite, with mineralized samples having values greater than unity. The entire suite has petrochemical characteristics of a shoshonitic arc suite, with relatively high alkalis (5-15 wt.%) over mafic to intermediate SiO2 contents (44-66 wt.%) and Mg numbers (48-77); accompanied by moderate LREE enrichment, low TiO2 (less than 1.1 wt.%), and low Ta (less than 1 ppm, n = 8) and Nb (all but one less than 20 ppm) contents. The volcanic rocks are comparable to broadly coeval shoshonites found elsewhere in Quesnellia and Stikinia, including in the Nicola and Stuhini Groups of southwestern and northern British Columbia, respectively. By comparison with the porphyry gold-bearing Tabir-Feni shoshonitic volcanic arc, and other porphyry Cu-Au-bearing arcs of the southwest Pacific, and considering regional tectonic features, the Late Triassic-Early Jurassic rocks of central Quesnellia may have formed as a result of arc reversal, with subduction of the adjacent Cache Creek and Slide Mountain oceanic terranes under the Quesnellia volcanic arc from the west and east, respectively.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;71</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ball, JB</author><author>Forster, SR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pitch Control at Prince George Pulp and Paper Mills</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>49-61</pages><volume>91</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>CHIPS</keyword><keyword>COST ENGINEERING</keyword><keyword>DISPERSANTS</keyword><keyword>FINES REMOVAL</keyword><keyword>PH CONTROL</keyword><keyword>PITCH CONTROL</keyword><keyword>PLUGGING</keyword><keyword>SCREENS</keyword><keyword>SKIMMING</keyword><keyword>TALL OIL SOAP</keyword><keyword>TEST METHODS</keyword><keyword>WATER BALANCE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><abstract>Blinding of brownstock Cowan screen plates with pitch, and dirt contamination of finished products, led the Prince George Pulp and Paper Mills' Prince George mill to an overall reassessment of the mill pitch control methods.

The project was started in 1 950 and included the Kenney Dam on the Nechako River in the Fraser catchment area, the creation of the Nechako Reservoir, and the construction of facilities for generating power at the Kemano River on the west coast. Completion of development (Kemano Completion Proposal), at a cost of over $2 billion, would divert 84 percent of the initial mean annual discharge of the N echako R iver, and 62 percent of the mean annual d ischarge of the N anika River in the Skeena catchment area, to the Kemano River. The proposal offers discharges that are intended to protect Pacific salmon stocks, or, where this is not possible, mitigation of losses. Tiris paper identifies the more obvious effects of abstraction and regulation on salmon populations and their habitat. These include interference with migration of adults, changes in the quality of spawning gravel, imposition of stress on all stages of the f ish f rom high total gas pressures and from alterations in ambient temperature, changes in the composition of the total fish community, changes in the production and availability of food, stranding of fish, weakening or loss of cues for homing, and increased exposure to predation from fish and birds. A major diff iculty in trying to relate effects to salmon populations lies in distinguishing fish numbers as determined by habitat effects, from numbers determined by the level of recruitment to the rivers as a result of exploitation by the fishery. Three approaches to the problem are; experimental design of impact assessment, modelling changes of discharge and salmon habitat, and analysis of case histories of regulated discharge. The last seems to be the most instructive per unit of effort required. As an approximation to obtaining replication of treatment effects, and to judge the reliability of prediction of effects of llow regulation, case hislories of regulated salmonid rivers were examined, lt was found that negative effects outnumbered positive ones, that prediction was usually incorrect, and that, even where flow regulation was implemented with the express intention of increasing numbers of salmonids the results fell short of expectations. On this evidence it appears that the outcome of a development as demanding of wateras Kemano Completion is difficult to predict in precise quantitative terms and carries some risk for natural ooDUlations.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4296/cwrj1101014</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2023-02-09 18:28:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morton, Cedar</author><author>Gunton, Thomas I.</author><author>Day, J.

Like a one-tiered model, the two-tiered model engages stakeholders in face-to-face negotiations to develop a consensus plan. However, to finalize an agreement, recommendations from the first tier are then sent to a second tier of negotiations that includes only two parties – First Nations and the provincial government. This innovative two-tiered collaborative process was designed to meet the unique position of First Nations and address the problem of low First Nations participation in previous single-tiered collaborative planning processes. Results based on 26 evaluative criteria indicate the two-tiered process was successful in increasing First Nations engagement while still meeting the interests of non-aboriginal stakeholders who did not participate at the second tier of negotiations. However, results also indicate a need to revise the two-tiered process to improve buy-in from non-aboriginal stakeholders while continuing to respect First Nations' constitutional rights. With these revisions, results suggest that a two-tiered collaborative planning model is a viable option worthy of consideration for cases in which one or more participants, such as aboriginal populations, have unique rights and interests that need to be accommodated in the process design.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09640568.2011.613592</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-25 22:43:35</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morrison, William R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In the North, For the North: Post-Secondary Education in the Provincial North</title><secondary-title>Nothern Review</secondary-title><short-title>In the North, For the North</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nothern Review</full-title></periodical><volume>0</volume><number>38</number><issue>38</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1929-6657</isbn><abstract>Abstract: For generations, promoters of northern political and economic development have emphasized the importance of post-secondary education.  These northern advocates have lamented the absence or narrow scope of post-secondary institutions in the North.  Canada is the only Circumpolar Nation without an Arctic university, and there is ample evidence that the region and the country are much the poorer for the lack of northern research, education and training capacity.  It is not that Canadian institutions have ignored the region.  Northern tier community colleges have played key and innovative roles in responding to regional needs.  Southern universities have, through a variety of undergraduate, graduate and professional outreach programs, provided some degree options in the North.  The University of the Arctic represents an innovative circumpolar effort to address northern needs across the Circumpolar North.  Focusing on the University of Northern British Columbia, which opened in 1994, this paper demonstrates how responsive, regionally-aware post-secondary institutions can have transformative effects on their host communities and regions, and deals with some of the controversies surrounding the opening of the university.</abstract><remote-database-name>journals.sfu.ca</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://journals.sfu.ca/nr/index.php/nr/article/view/325</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Monsalve, Maria Victoria</author><author>Edin, Glenn</author><author>Devine, Dana V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of HLA Class I and Class II in Na-Dene and Amerindian Populations from British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Human Immunology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human Immunology</full-title><abbr-1>Human Immunology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>48-55</pages><volume>59</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0198-8859</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0198-8859(97)00251-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>ABSTRACT: We analyzed the distribution of HLA class II alleles and haplotypes in one Na-Dene (Athabaskan) group from British Columbia (Canada) by PCR amplification of the DRB1, DQA1 and DQB1 second exon sequences.

The Wet'suwet'en cases are compared to the cases I have studied among two neighboring native groups in British Columbia, Canada: the Gitksan to the west and the Beaver to the northeast. The three groups have different beliefs in the possibility of cross-sex and multiple reincarnation which may relate to their differing attitudes towards succession to hereditary titles. However, the concept of reincarnation gives all three groups a similar perspective on personality formation which affects the way children are treated. While cultural patterning shapes the belief in reincarnation, further research is necessary to assess whether something like reincarnation may be actually taking place.</abstract><remote-database-name>journals.uchicago.edu (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/jar.44.4.3630506</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-24 22:30:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mills, Antonia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Three Years After Delgamuukw: The Continuing Battle Over Respect for First Nations Interests to Their Traditional Territories and Rights to Work Their Resources</title><secondary-title>Anthropology of Work Review</secondary-title><short-title>Three Years After Delgamuukw</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Anthropology of Work Review</full-title></periodical><pages>22-29</pages><volume>21</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1548-1417</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1525/awr.2000.21.2.22</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/awr.2000.21.2.22/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 22:35:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, BGN</author><author>Iverson, RM</author><author>Clague, JJ</author><author>Geertsema, M</author><author>Roberts, NJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Channel-amphitheatre landforms resulting from liquefaction flowslides during rapid drawdown of glacial Lake Fraser, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>GEOMORPHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOMORPHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><volume>392</volume><keywords><keyword>2.m Water</keyword><keyword>25.a Environment / Ecosystems</keyword><keyword>7.a Quantitative</keyword><keyword>8.c Ecosystem change</keyword><keyword>24.f Monitoring and evaluation</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>1.c Climate change</keyword><keyword>22.b Geospatial tools</keyword><keyword>24.h Cliamte change</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0169-555X,1872-695X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geomorph.2021.107898</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Unusual channel-amphitheatre landforms are present in Late Pleistocene-early Holocene, subaqueous fan and delta deposits in the glacial Lake Fraser basin, central British Columbia. The lake formed during the decay of the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet and drained-11,500 years ago during a large outburst flood. The fronts of a delta and two subaqueous fans consisting of silt to fine sand are marked by branching networks of wide, nearly flat channels that terminate upstream in digitate, steep-walled amphitheatres. We propose that these channel amphitheatre landforms formed by liquefaction flowslides that were induced by the rapid drawdown of glacial Lake Fraser during the outburst flood. Similar geomorphic forms, which we believe also to be associated with rapid drawdowns of large Late Pleistocene-early Holocene lakes, occur elsewhere in North America. A recent tailings dam failure and an intentional breaching of a 100-year-old hydroelectric dam provide insights into the processes responsible for the landforms. By using geomechanical analysis, we show how rapid lake drawdown can trigger liquefaction flowslides in deposits of silt to fine sand. The novelty of our approach lies in combining geomechanical reasoning with geomorphic analogues to understand histories of ancient glacier-dammed lakes and of the glacial lake outburst floods that are sourced from them.

A 16-member ensemble of SWAT hydrological model (HM) simulations, based on a comprehensive ensemble of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) simulations driven by two global climate models (GCMs), with five realizations of the Canadian CGCM3 and three realizations of the German ECHAM5 is established per catchment. This study aims to evaluate, once model bias has been removed by statistical post-processing (SP), how the RCM-simulated climate changes differ from those of the parent GCMs, and how they affect the assessment of climate change-induced hydrological impacts at the catchment scale. The variability of streamflow caused by the use of different SP methods (mean-based versus distribution-based) within each statistical post-processing pathway of climate model outputs (bias correction versus perturbation) is also evaluated, as well as the uncertainty of natural climate variability. The simulations cover 1971–2000 in the reference period and 2041–2070 in the future period. For a set of criteria, results based on raw and statistically post-processed model outputs for the reference climate are compared with observations. This process demonstrates that SP is important not only for GCMs outputs, but also for CRCM outputs. SP leads to a high level of agreement between the CRCM and the driving GCMs in reproducing patterns of observed climate. The ensemble spread of the climate change signal on streamflow is large and varies with catchments and hydrological periods (winter/summer flows). The results of various hydrological indicators show that most of the uncertainty arises from the natural climate variability followed by the statistical post-processing. The uncertainty linked to the choice of statistical pathway is much larger than that associated with the choice of the method in quantifying the hydrological impacts. We find that the incorporation of dynamical downscaling of global models through the CRCM as an intermediate step in the GCM–RCM–SP–HM model chain does not lead to considerable differences in the assessment of the climate change impacts on streamflow for the study catchments.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169414009688</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-05-09 16:35:00</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Troin, Magali</author><author>Caya, Daniel</author><author>Velázquez, Juan Alberto</author><author>Brissette, François</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrological response to dynamical downscaling of climate model outputs: A case study for western and eastern snowmelt-dominated Canada catchments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies</secondary-title><short-title>Hydrological response to dynamical downscaling of climate model outputs</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology: Regional Studies</full-title></periodical><pages>595-610</pages><volume>4</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-09</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>22145818</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejrh.2015.09.003</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>CrossRef</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2214581815001019</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-16 23:08:37</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whitfield, Paul H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regionalization of water quality in the upper fraser river basin, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Water Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Research</full-title><abbr-1>Water Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1053-1066</pages><volume>17</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0043-1354</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0043-1354(83)90045-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Uniformity of water quality in the Upper Fraser River basin was examined using cluster analysis. Substantial variations in water quality exist within the basin. These differences are largely related to the geology of the watersheds. Differences in water quality were more pronounced among the tributaries than along the mainstem of the Fraser River. The mainstem of the river could be considered to have three distinct reaches where water quality properties were relatively constant. Cluster analysis was a useful technique for establishing similarities and differences for both the tributaries and the mainstem stations. Some limitations of water quality data and the methods used are discussed. The diversity of water quality found to exist within this basin suggests that uniform criteria or objectives cannot be applied to the basin as a whole, but may be applied to smaller units.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0043135483900453</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 19:12:00</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Watson, Nigel</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrated river basin management: A case for collaboration</title><secondary-title>International Journal of River Basin Management</secondary-title><short-title>Integrated river basin management</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of River Basin Management</full-title></periodical><pages>243-257</pages><volume>2</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1571-5124</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15715124.2004.9635235</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Integrated river basin management (IRBM) is an approach that has been interpreted in a number of different ways during the last 100 years. Current support for IRBM is based on a ‘myth’ of inter‐agency co‐ordination. However, increasing complexity and uncertainty in river basin systems has created ‘wicked’ or ‘messy’ land and water management problems. The limited capacity of state institutions to deal effectively with such conditions suggests that the current ‘myth’ must be reformed and that a more powerful system‐response capability founded on inter‐organisational collaboration should be developed. The case for a collaborative institutional approach to IRBM is examined with reference to the Fraser Basin Council in British Columbia, Canada.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Nechako, Kenny Dam, Cheslatta, Nechako watershed</research-notes><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15715124.2004.9635235</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-27 17:32:21</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wikeem, B.

Over 10 million ha of Crown range is distributed among 11 biogeoclimatic zones. Forestland comprises nearly 80% of the landbase grazed. In the southern interior, the most important zones include the Bunchgrass, Ponderosa Pine, Interior Douglas-Fir and Montane Spruce zones. Forage yields vary from as much as 2700 kg ha−1 on grassland to &lt; 100 kg ha−1 under dense forest canopy. On seeded clearcuts, however, production may exceed 1500 kg ha−1. Average daily gains for steers and calves on forest range vary from 0.8 to 1.1 kg d−1. In the central interior and Peace River areas, the Sub-Boreal Pine–Spruce, Sub-Boreal Spruce and Boreal White and Black Spruce zones provide most of the forage for beef cattle. Seventeen community pastures, comprising nearly 170 000 ha, produce almost 50 000 animal-unit months (AUMs) of forage for cattle in this region.

Plus de 10 millions d'hectares (ha) de parcours de l'État se répartissent entre 11 zones biogéoclimatiques. La forêt couvre près de 80% du territoire pâturé. Dans le sud de l'intérieur, les zones les plus importantes sont la zone à graminées cespiteuses, la zone du pin Ponderosa, la zone du Douglas de l'intérieur et la zone montagnarde à épinette. Le rendement fourrager peut aller de 2700 kg ha−1 sur prairie à moins de 100 kg ha−1 sous couvert forestier dense. Dans les coupes à blanc ressemées, la production peut toutefois dépasser 1500 kg ha−1. Le QMQ das bouvillons et des veaux dans les parcours de forêt va de 0,8 kg à 1,1 kg j−1.

Censuses were conducted during spring, summer, autumn, and winter to investigate how use of riparian habitat changed seasonally. Stream-side riparian zones were characterized by a dense understorey of deciduous vegetation not found in the upslope forest. Nine bird species preferred the riparian understorey for breeding, six preferred it only during migration. Neotropical migrants (16 of 46 species) were more closely associated with stream-sides than year-round residents (11 species). Some breeding birds (five species) were significantly negatively associated with riparian habitats. The density of riparian birds declined with distance upstream but did not decline up to 250 m away from the stream. The more extensive riparian areas downstream supported a greater density of birds in all seasons compared to upstream areas, but more species only in spring and autumn. Species that nested in non-riparian areas in summer used riparian habitat in autumn, making riparian corridors in the northern coniferous forest important during migration. Maintaining both riparian and upslope habitats is necessary to preserve species diversity al the landscape level.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0587.1998.tb00666.x/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-06-17 22:57:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vogt, David</author><author>Gamble, David Alexander</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>You Don't Suppose the Dominion Government Wants to Cheat the Indians?": The Grand Trunk Pacific Railway and the Fort George Reserve, 1908-12</title><secondary-title>BC Studies</secondary-title><short-title>"YOU DON'T SUPPOSE THE DOMINION GOVERNMENT WANTS TO CHEAT THE INDIANS?</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BC Studies</full-title></periodical><number>166</number><issue>166</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>General Interest Periodicals--Canada</keyword><keyword>Humanities: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Native North Americans</keyword><keyword>colonialism</keyword><keyword>Canadian history</keyword><keyword>Cemeteries</keyword><keyword>Petitions</keyword><keyword>Religious missions</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>00052949</isbn><abstract>Between 1908 and 1912, the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway appropriated reserve land possessed by the Lheidli T'enneh Band at Fort George (now Prince George), B.C., offering $68 000, and ultimately paying $125 000, for land it later sold for more than $1 million. Band members were pressured by missionary clergy and the Department of Indian Affairs, to surrender the reserve to the railway swiftly and, from the perspective of the company, cheaply. Resistance by the band to the surrender did, however, result in temporarily stalled negotiations and a marked increase in compensation. The surrender or "sale" of Reserve No. 1 is illustrative of the broader phenomenon of the transfer of aboriginal reserve land to national railways, justified by the perceived benefit of the railway to the progress and development of Canada, and by the alleged benefit of relocation and isolation of the Lheidli T'enneh to their ultimate assimilation into Canadian society.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/bcstudies/article/view/288</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-10 21:39:50</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Velázquez, Juan Alberto</author><author>Troin, Magali</author><author>Caya, Daniel</author><author>Brissette, François</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluating the Time-Invariance Hypothesis of Climate Model Bias Correction: Implications for Hydrological Impact Studies</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrometeorology</secondary-title><short-title>Evaluating the Time-Invariance Hypothesis of Climate Model Bias Correction</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrometeorology</full-title><abbr-1>J.

The present study aims to assess statistical bias correction under nonstationary bias conditions and its implications on the simulated streamﬂow over two snowmelt-driven Canadian catchments. A pseudoreality approach is employed in order to derive a proxy of future observa- tions. In this approach, CRCM–ECHAM5 ensemble simulations are used as pseudoreality observations to correct for bias in the CRCM–CGCM3 ensemble simulations in the reference (1971–2000) period. The cli- mate model simulations are then bias corrected in the future (2041–70) period and compared with the future pseudoreality observations. This process demonstrates that biases (precipitation and temperature) remain after the bias correction. In a second step, the uncorrected and bias-corrected CRCM–CGCM3 simulations are used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model in both periods. The bias correction decreases the error on mean monthly streamﬂow over the reference period; such ﬁndings are more mixed over the future period. The results of various hydrological indicators show that the climate change signal on streamﬂow obtained with uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is similar in both its magnitude and its direction for the mean monthly streamﬂow only.

In the 1970s, however, research in this area became more focused in BC, following general trends in ethnobiology and cognitive anthropology in documenting systems of biological “folk taxonomy” in different cultures and languages worldwide.  This research reflects collaboration with ethnobotanists, linguists and Indigenous speakers and knowledge holders of First Nations’ languages, and includes recording the names and conceptual relationships of plant species and other plant categories. Identification of factors influencing plant nomenclature and shaping plant classification systems, and how these systems have changed over time and vary from language to language, has been a focus of the research. Most BC First Nations languages incorporate names for between about 120 and 150 different species or basic “generic rank” categories of plants. These tend to be arranged in a shallow hierarchy within a small number of higher order plant categories, such as for “tree,” “bush,” “grass.” In some culturally important species, more detailed sub-categories, within the “generic” taxa, are distinguished with more specific names. The indigenous categories for plants reflected in BC Indigenous languages and cognitive systems reflect culturally important plants, most of which are highly visible and widespread.</abstract><remote-database-name>ojs.library.ubc.ca</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/bcstudies/article/view/184111</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25 21:34:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turner, Nancy J.</author><author>Bhattacharyya, Jonaki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Salmonberry Bird and Goose Woman: Birds, Plants, and People In Indigenous Peoples' Lifeways In Northwestern North America</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ethnobiology</secondary-title><short-title>Salmonberry Bird and Goose Woman</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ethnobiology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Ethnobiology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>717-745</pages><volume>36</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Vanderhoof?

Salient species of both are recognized and named in virtually every language and both feature in countless ways in people's systems of knowledge, practice, and belief, as sources of food, materials, and medicines, and as ceremonial and religious symbols. However, these two major biological groups are also linked together, and their ecological associations are likewise reflected in cultural knowledge systems. In northwestern North America, there are many examples of the intersection of botanical and ornithological knowledge, reflected in people's vocabulary, narratives, belief systems, and management practices. Here we provide diverse illustrations of this intersection in cultural knowledge of plant-bird associations. These examples link together observations of bird habits and habitats with particular plant species and show how this complex integrated knowledge and experience has helped promote cultural richness and well-being for First Peoples of the region. Bird species from swans (Cygnus spp.) to hummingbirds (Trochilidae) and plants from edible root vegetables to nectar-producing flowers are exemplified as major representatives of ethnoecological connections. These relationships remind us of the importance of interspecies ties to environmental and cultural integrity—a key to sustainable living into the future.</abstract><remote-database-name>bioone.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2993/0278-0771-36.4.717</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 17:23:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tobin, Pamela</author><author>Margo, Hanlon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Appropriate engagement and nutrition education on reserve: lessons learned from the Takla Lake First Nation in Northern BC</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Indigenous Health</secondary-title><short-title>Appropriate engagement and nutrition education on reserve</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Indigenous Health</full-title></periodical><pages>49-57</pages><volume>6</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Concerns about living conditions on First Nations1 reserves are attracting a great deal of attention from public health practitioners and researchers looking to design and implement measures to improve and promote health. Issues related to geographic isolation, low socioeconomic status, and threats to traditional practices are known to contribute to poor health outcomes, especially amongst Aboriginal youth. Research and educational programs are needed to address these challenges yet even the most state-of-the art initiatives are destined to fail if they are perceived to be disrespectful of, and insensitive to, local First Nations' culture and ways of knowing. Inspired by Smith's call for decolonized methodologies, we develop the concept of appropriate engagement as a framework for working with First Nations.

Simultaneously, a Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in northwest BC has been responsible for killing thousands of hectares of pine plantations and has even resulted in the death of mature trees, which is unprecedented. Both of these globally significant forest pest epidemics have been linked to climate change. The beetle epidemic has grossly exceeded the scale of all previously recorded outbreaks, in large part due to a lack of cold winters. In this sense, the link to global warming is relatively straightforward and foreseeable. Of all climate change projections, the prediction of an increase in winter temperatures has been associated with as high a degree of confidence as any. The Dothistroma needle blight epidemic and its link to climate change were not so predictable. Based on weather records over the past four decades, short-term increases in mean summer precipitation correlate closely with historical records of Dothistroma outbreaks in the northwest. The current most severe outbreak has occurred during a prolonged period of above-average summer precipitation. An increase in summer precipitation would more typically be thought of as beneficial for forests, but that increase in moisture has improved the conditions for a pathogen that has outweighed any benefits. Similar trends of increasing incidence and severity for other forest pathogens in BC appear in areas that have been receiving increased summer precipitation. Conversely, in the southern interior of the province decreased summer precipitation and increased drought conditions are resulting in stressed trees which can favour root diseases. Early indications are that climate change will have profound effects on forest health. Some effects will be more predictable than others.</abstract><research-notes>Location: BC Interior</research-notes><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/07060661.2011.563908</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-27 22:22:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, Patricia Burke</author><author>Rossiter, David A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The politics of refusal: Aboriginal sovereignty and the Northern Gateway pipeline</title><secondary-title>The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien</secondary-title><short-title>The politics of refusal</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Canadian Geographer / Le Géographe canadien</full-title></periodical><pages>n/a-n/a</pages><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal title</keyword><keyword>natural resource development</keyword><keyword>colombie-britannique</keyword><keyword>développement des ressources naturelles</keyword><keyword>droits territoriaux des Autochtones</keyword><keyword>Northern Gateway pipeline</keyword><keyword>oléoduc Northern Gateway</keyword><keyword>politics of refusal</keyword><keyword>politique du refus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-11-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12325</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examines the politics of Aboriginal title in British Columbia in the context of the approval process for the Northern Gateway pipeline proposal. We highlight presentations made by First Nations representatives and individuals during the Community Hearings for Oral Evidence stage of the Joint Review Panel, as well as the political actions of First Nations governments, organizations, and individuals outside the hearings. Speakers from several different nations articulated common points with regard to territory, property, and place in support of a case for sovereignty. Building from Aboriginal political theory, we argue that the evidence supports a reading of Aboriginal positions on the pipeline as a politics of refusal, the starting point of which lies within Aboriginal knowledge and governance systems, and not mere reaction to the development proposal. We hope to see more critical geographies of natural resource development incorporate Aboriginal theory into their frameworks. La politique du refus : la souveraineté autochtone et l'oléoduc Northern Gateway Cette étude s'intéresse aux questions politiques portant sur les droits territoriaux des Autochtones en Colombie-Britannique qui émergent du processus d'approbation du projet d'oléoduc Northern Gateway. Nous proposons un survol des différents exposés des représentants et individus des Premières nations entendus lors de la phase des Audiences communautaires pour la présentation de la preuve orale de la Commission d'examen conjoint, ainsi que les actions politiques réalisées par des gouvernements, organisations et individus des Premières nations en parallèle aux audiences. Des conférenciers provenant de différentes nations ont fait ressortir les mêmes points en ce qui concerne le territoire, la propriété et le lieu en démontrant le bien-fondé de la souveraineté. Prenant comme base la théorie politique autochtone, nous faisons valoir que les témoignages recueillis indiquent que les positions autochtones sur l'oléoduc s'inscrivent dans une politique du refus dont la source se trouve dans les systèmes de savoir et de gouvernance autochtone, et non dans une simple réaction à la proposition de projet. Il est souhaitable que la théorie autochtone occupe une place centrale dans les perspectives critiques en géographie du développement des ressources naturelles.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cag.12325/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-06 21:36:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hobson, K.

Here we examined the relationship between δD in feathers and growing season precipitation for neotropical migrant songbirds breeding over a continent-wide isotopic gradient. δD values were determined on feathers of 140 individuals of 6 species of wild insectivorous forest songbirds (Setophaga ruticilla, Empidonax minimus, Vermivora peregrinus, Catharus ustulatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Hylocichla mustelina) taken from 14 breeding locations across North America. The δD of feathers was strongly correlated with the δD of growing season precipitation at breeding sites across North America. As feather hydrogen is metabolically inert after growth, this relationship was then used to assess the breeding origins of wintering migrants. Deuterium values of feathers from 64 individuals representing 5 species of migrants (Helmitheros vermivorus, Wilsonia citrina, Hylocichla mustelina, Dumetella carolinensis, Seirus aurocapillus) at a wintering site in Guatemala were consistent with those predicted from the known breeding ranges of these species. This study demonstrates hydrogen isotopes may become a powerful tool for linking breeding and wintering grounds of neotropical migrant songbirds, as well as other migratory species moving between isotopically distinct regions.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s004420050068</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-29 22:25:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hinch, Scott G</author><author>Rand, Peter S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Optimal swimming speeds and forward-assisted propulsion: energy-conserving behaviours of upriver-migrating adult salmon</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</secondary-title><short-title>Optimal swimming speeds and forward-assisted propulsion</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

Long-distance migrants should be efficient in their use of energy and minimize swimming costs wherever possible. We explore swimming strategies and energy-saving tactics employed by three long-distance-migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) stocks in the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia. We used stereovideography and bank-side observations to estimate swimming speeds (from tailbeat frequency) and ground speeds (using distance traveled and duration) for individuals at several sites. Salmon were highly efficient at migration (i.e., ground speeds equaled or exceeded swimming speeds) through reaches with relatively low encountered currents (&lt;0.25 m·s-1). We speculate that salmon exploit small reverse-flow vortices to achieve this feat. With low encountered currents, most salmon migrated according to an optimal swimming speed model: migrants minimized transport costs per unit distance traveled. Generally, salmon were less efficient at mig..., Les migrations anadromes des saumons coûtent cher en énergie. Les poissons qui migrent sur de longues distances doivent faire une utilisation efficace de l'énergie et minimiser chaque fois que c'est possible le coût de la nage. Nous avons examiné les stratégies de nage et les tactiques de conservation d'énergie chez trois populations de saumons rouges (Oncorhynchus nerka) qui migrent sur de longues distances dans le bassin du fleuve Fraser en Colombie-Britannique. À l'aide de vidéographie stéréoscopique et d'observations depuis la rive, il a été possible d'estimer la vitesse de nage (à partir de la fréquence de battement de la queue) et la vitesse au sol (au moyen de la distance parcourue et de la durée du trajet) pour des individus à plusieurs sites. Les saumons sont très efficaces dans leur migration (i.e., la vitesse au sol équivaut à la vitesse de nage ou la surpasse) dans les zones où les courants sont relativement faibles (&lt;0,25 m·s-1).

Imprecision in both of these factors leads to error in the final escapement estimate and, thus, affects its reliability as an index of escapement over time. The population of Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha in the Nechako River, British Columbia, was chosen for a case study, and this paper illustrates how simple simulation models can be used to explore the increases in precision about escapement estimates associated with increasing the frequency of aerial flights. Results show that confidence in escapement estimates for the Nechako River Chinook salmon population decreases as the frequency of survey flights decreases; results also show that this pattern is robust to the typically small annual differences in mean residence time in the Nechako River. Such models can help managers optimize the frequency of aerial flights by comparing the benefits of frequent flights (i.e., increased precision in escapement estimates) with the costs of those flights.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1577/1548-8675(1997)017&lt;0461:OACFFT&gt;2.3.CO;2</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-23 01:06:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heikkilä, Karen</author><author>Fondahl, Gail</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Co-managed research: non-Indigenous thoughts on an Indigenous toponymy project in northern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cultural Geography</secondary-title><short-title>Co-managed research</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cultural Geography</full-title></periodical><pages>61-86</pages><volume>29</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>collaborative research</keyword><keyword>methodology</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>co-managed research</keyword><keyword>indigenous</keyword><keyword>toponymy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-02-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0887-3631</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08873631.2012.646891</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper reflects on the methodological challenges of co-managed research as experienced from a non-Indigenous perspective.

Some events are specific to the topic; others are characteristic of co-managed research in general. We offer insights into what it means as non-Indigenous researchers to enter discursive territory that is charged with emotion and cultural sensitivity, and also explore the often contentious issues that can arise in Indigenous research, particularly oral history, ethnohistorical interpretation, and cultural representation. The paper concludes by discussing the opportunities and challenges of co-managed research.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08873631.2012.646891</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-24 22:43:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kang, Do Hyuk</author><author>Gao, Huilin</author><author>Shi, Xiaogang</author><author>Islam, Siraj ul</author><author>Déry, Stephen J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impacts of a Rapidly Declining Mountain Snowpack on Streamflow Timing in Canada’s Fraser River Basin</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title><abbr-1>Sci Rep</abbr-1></periodical><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-01-27</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-2322</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/srep19299</electronic-resource-num><abstract>With its headwaters in the water towers of the western Cordillera of North America, the Fraser River is one of the continent’s mightiest rivers by annual flows, supplies vital freshwater resources to populous downstream locations, and sustains the world’s largest stocks of sockeye salmon along with four other salmon species. Here we show the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model’s ability to reproduce accurately observed trends in daily streamflow for the Fraser River’s main stem and six of its major tributaries over 1949-2006 when air temperatures rose by 1.4 °C while annual precipitation amounts remained stable. Rapidly declining mountain snowpacks and earlier melt onsets result in a 10-day advance of the Fraser River’s spring freshet with subsequent reductions in summer flows when up-river salmon migrations occur.

The Fraser River is the longest waterway in BC and supports the world’s most abundant Pacific Ocean salmon populations. Previous modeling and observational studies have demonstrated that the FRB is a snow-dominated system, but with climate change, it may evolve to a pluvial regime. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the changing contribution of snow to the hydrology of the FRB over the latter half of the twentieth century. To this end, a 0.25° atmospheric forcing dataset is used to drive the VIC model from 1949 to 2006 (water years) at a daily time step over a domain covering the entire FRB. A model evaluation is first conducted over 11 major subwatersheds of the FRB to quantitatively assess the spatial variations of snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff (R). The ratio of the spatially averaged maximum SWE to R (RSR) is used to quantify the contribution of snow to the runoff in the 11 subwatersheds of interest. From 1949 to 2006, RSR exhibits a significant decline in 9 of the 11 subwatersheds (with p &lt; 0.05 according to the Mann–Kendall test statistics). To determine the sensitivity of RSR, the air temperature and precipitation in the forcing dataset are then perturbed. The ratio RSR decreases more significantly, especially during the 1990s and 2000s, when air temperatures have warmed considerably compared to the 1950s. On the other hand, increasing precipitation by a multiplicative factor of 1.1 causes RSR to decrease. As the climate continues to warm, ecological processes and human usage of natural resources in the FRB may be substantially affected by its transition from a snow to a hybrid (nival/pluvial) and even a rain-dominated system.</abstract><remote-database-name>journals.ametsoc.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JHM-D-13-0120.1</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-26 15:13:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>King, Leslie A.</author><author>Hood, Virginia L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecosystem Health and Sustainable Communities: North and South</title><secondary-title>Ecosystem Health</secondary-title><short-title>Ecosystem Health and Sustainable Communities</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecosystem Health</full-title><abbr-1>Ecosystem Health</abbr-1></periodical><pages>49-57</pages><volume>5</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999-03-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1526-0992</isbn><abstract>ABSTRACT It is at the local/community level that the connections among ecosystem health, the health of human communities, and individual livelihoods are most apparent and critical. This paper reports a number of community initiatives aimed at improving or providing alternative livelihoods, while at the same time conserving or restoring the integrity of the ecosystem on which the community depends. It presents case studies of Zimbabwe’s CAMPFIRE (Communal Areas Management Program for Indigenous Resources) and Akwesasne in northeastern North America, as well as examples from northern Canada, of communities that have attempted to integrate economic development, community values/culture, and the restoration of ecosystem and community health. In both the north and the south these communities face ecological pressures such as climate change, industrial pollution, loss of diversity and productivity, deforestation, and resulting loss of traditional livelihood strategies. They are also victims of global economic forces, economic and institutional globalization, and are struggling to make adaptive responses. Common themes are identified across the case studies and we identify the need for indicators and programs that recognize and reinforce the interconnections and guide development programs that integrate community and ecosystem health and sustainability.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1526-0992.1999.09906.x/full</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 21:02:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hughes, Geoffrey E.

The AFPP is a participatory decision-making tool designed to enhance co-management of the John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) in central interior British Columbia, Canada and to elicit goals, objectives, criteria, and indicators of sustainable forest management from the JPRFs Aboriginal partners. Analysis of community interview transcripts, traditional land use documentation, and secondary sources resulted in a three-stage approach to information elicitation, management, and application. Resource and social values, concerns, and traditional knowledge are summarized and compiled according to criteria themes and sub-themes.

These templates, however, may not be an appropriate approach for directing landscape-level forest management strategies. Instead, many argue that sustainable management should be determined using “bottom–up” approaches rather than standardized frameworks. This requires engaging local expertise in defining sustainability. Having a culturally distinct form of local knowledge, Aboriginal communities have an important role to play in decision-making processes. However, conventional participatory approaches, such as generic C&amp;amp;I frameworks and multi-stakeholder planning processes, are often inappropriate for engaging Aboriginal involvement. We suggest that landscape-level forest planning should highlight rather than assimilate cultural perspectives on sustainable forest management. Using the co-managed John Prince Research Forest in central interior British Columbia as a case study, this paper presents the results of using C&amp;amp;I and a scenario planning approach to describe an Aboriginal perspective of good forest stewardship. These results demonstrate that, in contrast with existing C&amp;amp;I frameworks, locally-based sustainability criteria provide better guidance for developing and adapting landscape-level forest plans.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204602001962</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-25 23:18:46</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>John Shepherd</author><author>Kaitlyn Vardy</author><author>Allan Wilson</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying patron time-use of a public library</title><secondary-title>Library Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Library Management</full-title><abbr-1>Library Management</abbr-1></periodical><pages>448-461</pages><volume>36</volume><number>6/7</number><issue>6/7</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015-07-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0143-5124</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1108/LM-09-2014-0110</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Conventional public library statistics are invaluable for management’s evaluation of library use and for benchmark comparisons. However, as the range and complexity of library services has grown, the number of performance measures has also proliferated. Since public library statistics cannot easily be combined into an overall measure of performance, researchers have proposed several global performance measures. Metrics such as The Library Quotient and HARPL Index have been received with varying degrees of acceptance. As public libraries compete for funding against other interests within the municipal environment, they require measures that are meaningful, pragmatic and that resonate with local decision makers. Existing metrics do not allow local government officials to easily compare the use of public libraries to other municipal facilities intended for public use or measure the impact of libraries on their users (Streatfield and Markless, 2006, p. 6). A novel approach to public library performance measurement was developed by college students during a volunteer project at the Prince George Public Library. Their time-based metric was further refined after a review of the literature and replicated as a case study research project in 2013.

Disturbed by reports of high concentrations of cadmium in large land mammals in Arctic Canada, community members wondered if they should eat less moose (Alces alces). Study design. Risk assessment modelling. Methods. We measured cadmium concentrations in moose tissues donated by food hunters. As a conservative assumption, we took the upper limits of the 95% confidence intervals for the means. Cadmium intake from other sources we estimated using risk assessment models. Assuming a Tolerable Daily Intake of cadmium of 1 microgram per kg body weight per day, we calculated maximum allowable intakes of moose kidney, liver and muscle. Results. For a non-smoking 70 kg adult, allowable monthly intakes are: 52 kg of moose muscle, or 137 g of kidney, or 516 g of liver. Allowable intakes varied by age and in proportion to body weight. Cigarette smokers (one to 1.5 packs per day) reach the limit even if they consume no moose at all. Conclusions. Adults may continue to eat moose kidney and liver occasionally and in moderate amounts, but children and cigarette smokers should not eat these organs at all. Consumption of moose muscle need not be restricted. Monitoring of cadmium concentrations in moose should continue.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.3402/ijch.v63i0.17893</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:44:49</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jenness, Diamond</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Myths of the Carrier Indians of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>The Journal of American Folklore</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of American Folklore</full-title><abbr-1>The Journal of American Folklore</abbr-1></periodical><pages>97-257</pages><volume>47</volume><number>184/185</number><issue>184/185</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1934</year><pub-dates><date>1934</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-8715</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/535461</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.jstor.org/stable/535461</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:55:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jarvis-Selinger, Sandra</author><author>Ho, Kendall</author><author>Novak Lauscher, Helen</author><author>Bell, Brandi</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tl’azt’en Learning Circle: Information Technology, Health and Cultural Preservation</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Community Informatics</secondary-title><short-title>Tl’azt’en Learning Circle</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Community Informatics</full-title></periodical><volume>4</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Access</keyword><keyword>Community Information</keyword><keyword>Learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-04-24</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1712-4441</isbn><abstract>A Community Learning Centre (CLC) is an innovative model of delivering health care and health information based firmly on the idea of community engagement.

The minimum viable population size (MVP) is the threshold size above which populations support recruitment and grow and below which populations fail to support recruitment and decline. We estimated a single, cross-population MVP using data from multiple populations and quantile regression, which removed the effects of factors other than population size. Only two populations (those in the Bonneville and Dalles reservoirs on the Columbia River), both with significant increasing trends, were larger than our MVP estimate. We detected significant decreasing trends in two populations—those below Bonneville Dam and in the Kootenai River. To discover how site-specific differences in river habitat influence MVP, we used a population viability analysis (PVA) model that incorporated Allee mechanisms. The PVA model identified a river segment length below which extinction was certain regardless of initial population size. Above this threshold, simulated populations in river segments that were longer or that provided more frequent recruitment opportunities were able to persist with smaller initial sizes. Two priorities emerged for white sturgeon: monitoring age structure and understanding the circumstances preventing recruitment to age 1. Our results ultimately guided us toward thresholds in rearing habitat and age structure that promise to develop into more useful conservation tools than MVP for this and similar long-lived species.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1577/T09-069.1</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jackson, Tony</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the economics of industrial ecology through case studies of industrial symbiosis in the forest industries of British Columbia and Scotland</title><secondary-title>Progress in Industrial Ecology, an International Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Progress in Industrial Ecology, an International Journal</full-title><abbr-1>Progress in Industrial Ecology, an International Journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>166-184</pages><volume>2</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Tl`azt`en Nation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-8917</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1504/PIE.2005.007186</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The concept of industrial ecology is intrinsically appealing, but the practical sustainability of its precepts has yet to be adequately tested beyond the site-specific locations of most of its exemplars. Any environmental assessment must cover both sourcing and markets to establish whether initiatives to minimise mass and energy loss and promote symbiotic activities on-site are well-founded in coherent sustainable strategies for the relevant sectors off-site. The economics of industrial ecology is explored within this analytical framework, examining the interactions between the compositional and the technological elements of production that may combine to decouple environmental pollution from economic growth. Following a brief review of current industrial ecology exemplars in the forest industries sector, contrasting case studies of nascent dematerialisation of forest industries throughput are analysed. British Columbian First Nations' initiatives entailing communal eco-management systems within ancient temperate rainforests are compared with attempts to develop a modern Scottish forest industries cluster based on exotic softwood plantations. The findings emphasise the need for industrial ecology to extend its scope to embrace reform on broader resource management policies, as well as the promotion of site-based ecological technology, if it is to deliver the institutional reflexivity that can internalise both physical and economic environmental externalities.</abstract><remote-database-name>inderscienceonline.com (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/PIE.2005.007186</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:47:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>J, McGregor</author><author>N, Hanlon</author><author>S, Emmons</author><author>D, Voaklander</author><author>K, Kelly</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>If all ambulances could fly: putting provincial standards of emergency care access to the test in Northern British Columbia.</title><secondary-title>Canadian journal of rural medicine</secondary-title><short-title>If all ambulances could fly</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian journal of rural medicine</full-title><abbr-1>Can J Rural Med</abbr-1></periodical><pages>163-168</pages><volume>10</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1203-7796</isbn><abstract>Geographic access to emergency treatment remains an important public policy concern as rural emergency medical systems respond to various pressures to centralize services. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) are effective tools to determine what proportion of a given population is adequately served by existing or proposed service distributions. METHODS: This study compares 2 GIS approaches to determining whether recent standards of emergency care access established by the British Columbia Ministry of Health Services are being met in Northern British Columbia. In particular, we compare results obtained using the more commonly used straight-line, or "as the crow flies," method with those obtained using a more sophisticated method that estimates travel time using digitally referenced road network data. RESULTS: Both methods reveal that provincial standards of emergency access are not being met in Northern British Columbia. CONCLUSION: In terms of comparing the 2 approaches, the network technique indicated a lower level of access and was more accurate in identifying populations residing inside and outside the "golden hour" of emergency care.</abstract><remote-database-name>europepmc.org</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/16079032</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16079032</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hutchings, J A</author><author>Walters, C</author><author>Haedrich, R L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Is scientific inquiry incompatible with government information control?</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

Calculated mean daily doses of methylmercury for the target populations were compared to the estimated average dose for the general population. We also determined the percentages of the native women populations with exposures exceeding current guidance values as well as published thresholds for neurological effects.

Available dose-response data included multivariate measurements of central nervous system functioning in Iraqi children exposed to methylmercury prenatally. We applied the method of principal components to simplify the data structure. The first principal component described close to 80% of the variability in the data, making it a reasonable choice as an index. The relationship between mercury in maternal hair and the probability of an abnormal neurological effects index was modeled with the logistic and Weibull functions. The goodness-of-fit of the two models is discussed and the results compared to other published dose-response analyses. Exposure distributions were developed to represent methylmercury dose by using observed data on methylmercury contamination in the lakes and reservoir and reasonable assumptions about other key parameters such as fish consumption. We estimated risks to the target population using Monte Carlo simulation. Consumption of reasonable quantities of fish from these bodies of water does not pose a significant risk to the aboriginal population.</abstract><remote-database-name>link.springer.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02409649</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-08-11 18:51:17</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hodder, Dexter P.</author><author>Johnson, Chris J.</author><author>Rea, Roy V.</author><author>Zedrosser, Andreas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of a species distribution model to identify and manage bear den habitat in central British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Wildlife Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Wildlife Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Wildlife Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>238-245</pages><volume>20</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>tl'azt'en</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-08-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0909-6396</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2981/wlb.00037</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Several mammals have adapted to harsh winter conditions by adopting hibernation strategies that enable them to survive periods of unfavourable environmental conditions. At northern latitudes, black and brown bears can be in a state of hibernation for up to seven months. As a result of this prolonged occupation of one small space, bears can be vulnerable to environmental and human caused disturbances. In this study, we developed a predictive model that identifies potential den habitat for black bears that can assist with management planning for industrial land development activities. We identified 40 dens (17 excavated in soil and 23 natural rock cavities) and used fine-scale information to determine how dens were positioned in forest stands. We found that bears denned in areas on mid to upper slope positions and that soil dens were located mainly in clay-loam soil complexes while rock cavity dens were either caves or cavities in boulder piles. Den location was distant from portions of the study area with relatively high road density. We then used resource selection functions to predict where bear dens might be located on the landscape. When applied to the GIS data, the averaged coefficients suggested that 3.1% of the study area had a high suitability ranking as den habitat while 9.1%, 14.6%, and 73.2% had mid, low, and limited suitability, respectively. In our study area, habitat for den sites is reasonably predictable and should be considered during the planning of industrial activities.</abstract><remote-database-name>bioone.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2981/wlb.00037</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:50:39</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larsen, Soren C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Regions of care: a political ecology of reciprocal materialities</title><secondary-title>Journal of Political Ecology</secondary-title><short-title>Regions of care</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Political Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>159-166</pages><volume>23</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.academia.edu/download/46185181/Larsen.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-16 23:05:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Korsmo, Fae L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Claiming Memory in British Columbia: Aboriginal Rights and the State</title><secondary-title>American Indian Culture and Research Journal</secondary-title><short-title>Claiming Memory in British Columbia</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Indian Culture and Research Journal</full-title><abbr-1>American Indian Culture and Research Journal</abbr-1></periodical><pages>71-90</pages><volume>20</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0161-6463</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.17953/aicr.20.4.k226777316430n41</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>uclajournals.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.uclajournals.org/doi/abs/10.17953/aicr.20.4.k226777316430n41</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 19:03:03</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Leeuw, Sarah de</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indigenous relationships, logging roads, and first-class medicine</title><secondary-title>Canadian Family Physician</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Family Physician</full-title><abbr-1>Can Fam Physician</abbr-1></periodical><pages>68-71</pages><volume>62</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-350X, 1715-5258</isbn><abstract>On first glance, there’s not much in common between 10-ply tires for a diesel-engine, 4 ×4 Super Duty Ford F-350 and a recently released national report entitled “First Peoples, Second Class Treatment.”1 Ask Dr John Pawlovich about the two, however, and you will receive an eloquent answer about transforming the way medicine is delivered to isolated northern First Nations communities, communities with some of the worst health conditions in our country. “I often feel horrified that there are people in this country living in the conditions we still see on reserves.

A flow-duration curve represents the annual flow-frequency characteristics of rivers by depicting the cumulative frequencies for average ranked flows in a river. Generally the process requires the empirical estimation of the mean flow at each of 365 ranks. A model requiring only five parameters is developed by combining the principles of order statistics and traditional flow-frequency analyses and is applied to flow-duration curves for rivers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Results from the model may be interpreted both statistically and physically and allow the identification of hydrologically similar regions. Streamflows in British Columbia are generated from a number of distinct physical processes operating in highly diverse environments. The mixture of the streamflow-generating processes requires that the statistical model be capable of encompassing the different flow-frequency regimes. Identification of hydrologic regions also depends on the inclusion of these generating processes. The model presented incorporates the physical generating processes of streamflow in both the statistical representation of flow-duration curves and their interpretation. Similarly, the spatial model presents hydrologic regions that correspond to the known physical environment.

The unusually heavy electrical loading of the 300-kV transmission system is treated at some length, as well as the mechanical loading. In addition, the plant power-supply features of what will ultimately be the largest aluminium-reduction works in the world, at Kitimat, are discussed.

Through place-based protest, organizing, and direct action, Native and non-Native people are interacting with place as a conscious being with the capacity to speak, create, and teach the responsibilities required for more inclusive forms of coexistence in today’s settler states. This “placework” articulates a more-than-human geographical self whose subjectivities are grounded in, and accountable to, land-based relationships and knowledges. Placework contributes to a geographical posthumanism that offers a distinctively Indigenous approach to the predicaments of the Anthropocene.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/2373566X.2016.1157003</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-10-11 01:36:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larsen, Soren C.</author><author>Johnson, Jay T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>In between worlds: place, experience, and research in Indigenous geography</title><secondary-title>Journal of Cultural Geography</secondary-title><short-title>In between worlds</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Cultural Geography</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>29</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>methodology</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>tl'azt'en</keyword><keyword>epistemology</keyword><keyword>ethics</keyword><keyword>Indigenous research</keyword><keyword>place</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-02-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0887-3631</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08873631.2012.646887</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this introduction to the special issue, we explore how the experience of on-the-ground research in Indigenous geography transforms Native and non-Native practitioners by challenging, reworking, and ultimately expanding their existential, social, and conceptual understandings of place.

Local leaders both construct and mobilize place as a vital part of their efforts to promote community well-being. This study focuses on the ways that the residents of three towns in the province's northern interior politicized place as a strategy for resisting the political influence and geographic designs of outsiders. The residents drew from their shared emotional response to powerlessness as a means of highlighting the inequities between insiders and outsiders, thereby generating a regional identity that calls into question the socioeconomic effects of resource industrialization in the north. In describing this dialectic between place making and economic restructuring, the article not only expands upon existing theory on place identity, but also contributes to a fuller understanding of the cultural geography of North America's resource-dependent communities.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Grassy Plains, Takysie Lake, Burns Lake, Takysie Lake</research-notes><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-8306.2004.00442.x</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-05-27 17:47:11</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larkin, P.

Environmental impact assessment is a process aimed at guarding the public interest in the proper use of resources in the aggregate. Compromises are usually worked out on a local basis for each project. More widely conceived trade-offs are favored by all but practised by few. All projects go through various stages, all begin as vague schemes; some crystallize as firm proposals and then go through the assessment process to construction and a subsequent period of operation. Environmental impact assessment as a process should reflect this pattern of activity rather than being just the preparation of statements about projects that are imminent. I have given particular emphasis to the need for follow up on whether what occurred was what was predicted. Also I have stressed the importance of anticipating that some impacts will not be foreseen and, therefore, the necessity for making ap..., La présente étude porte sur l'évaluation des effets environnementaux dans le cadre de grands projets ayant une incidence sur les milieux aquatiques au Canada. L'évaluation des effets environnementaux vise la protection de l'intérêt du public pour ce qui est de l'utilisation rationnelle des ressources. On arrive généralement à des compromis sur une base locale pour chaque projet. Tous sont en faveur des concessions mais peu en font. Tous les projets passent par diverses étapes en commençant par de vagues plans. Certains se cristallisent comme propositions fermes, puis passent par l'évaluation, la construction et la période d'application. En tant que processus, l'évaluation des effets environnementaux devrait réfléter ce schème d'activité au lieu de n'être que la préparation d'énoncés sur les projets imminents.

The physical and botanical characteristics of these sites were described to find what features (if any) distinguished them from the forest at large. Raised and open aspect, sparse tree cover, free-draining soils, and a simple flora with abundant lichens were features common to all the sites, but were lacking in the denser forest around. Scores for these attributes were ordinated by multidimensional scaling of similarities and differences from site to site. Separate searings for (i) terrain features, (ii) tree cover attributes, and (iii) floristic content each yielded a single cluster of points with few outliers and no particular pattern or trend. The inference is that the sites conformed to a single type with limited variation. A profile of the distinguishing characteristics was compiled and then applied to transects through the general migration area by persons unfamiliar with it beforehand. Sites which matched the profile proved easy to identify, even though they comprised only a small proportion of the area. Sites with high scores for the most distinctive attributes had more caribou at the time of radio-tracking.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.ub.uit.no</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ub.uit.no/baser/septentrio/index.php/rangifer/article/view/1278</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-06-17 22:49:47</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lamers, Patrick</author><author>Junginger, Martin</author><author>Dymond, Caren C.</author><author>Faaij, André</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Damaged forests provide an opportunity to mitigate climate change</title><secondary-title>GCB Bioenergy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GCB Bioenergy</full-title><abbr-1>GCB Bioenergy</abbr-1></periodical><pages>44-60</pages><volume>6</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>carbon break-even</keyword><keyword>carbon debt</keyword><keyword>carbon parity</keyword><keyword>CBM-CFS3</keyword><keyword>climate change mitigation</keyword><keyword>forest biomass</keyword><keyword>Mountain Pine Beetle</keyword><keyword>temporal carbon analysis</keyword><keyword>wood pellets</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1757-1707</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/gcbb.12055</electronic-resource-num><abstract>British Columbia (BC) forests are estimated to have become a net carbon source in recent years due to tree death and decay caused primarily by mountain pine beetle (MPB) and related post-harvest slash burning practices. BC forest biomass has also become a major source of wood pellets, exported primarily for bioenergy to Europe, although the sustainability and net carbon emissions of forest bioenergy in general are the subject of current debate. We simulated the temporal carbon balance of BC wood pellets against different reference scenarios for forests affected by MPB in the interior BC timber harvesting area using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). We evaluated the carbon dynamics for different insect-mortality levels, at the stand- and landscape level, taking into account carbon storage in the ecosystem, wood products and fossil fuel displacement. Our results indicate that current harvesting practices, in which slash is burnt and only sawdust used for pellet production, require between 20–25 years for beetle-impacted pine and 37–39 years for spruce-dominated systems to reach pre-harvest carbon levels (i.e. break-even) at the stand-level. Using pellets made from logging slash to replace coal creates immediate net carbon benefits to the atmosphere of 17–21 tonnes C ha−1, shortening these break-even times by 9–20 years and resulting in an instant carbon break-even level on stands most severely impacted by the beetle. Harvesting pine dominated sites for timber while using slash for bioenergy was also found to be more carbon beneficial than a protection reference scenario on both stand- and landscape level. However, harvesting stands exclusively for bioenergy resulted in a net carbon source unless the system contained a high proportion of dead trees (&gt;85%). Systems with higher proportions of living trees provide a greater climate change mitigation if used for long lived wood products.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcbb.12055/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 17:24:26</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kutzner, Diana</author><author>Wright, Pamela A.</author><author>Stark, Amelia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identifying tourists' preferences for Aboriginal tourism product features: implications for a northern First Nation in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Ecotourism</secondary-title><short-title>Identifying tourists' preferences for Aboriginal tourism product features</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Ecotourism</full-title></periodical><pages>99-114</pages><volume>8</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-06-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1472-4049</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/14724040802695991</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent research on the Aboriginal tourism market has revolved predominantly around establishing a profile of the traveller interested in Aboriginal tourism (hereafter referred to as the Aboriginal tourism traveller). Currently, the Aboriginal tourism traveller is generally described as a mature individual who is interested in having authentic experiences of different cultures. However, there is a need for a better understanding of what specific products this particular traveller is interested in, and in what style, format or nature of delivery. The study presented in this article attempts to provide insight into this topic. In a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, a questionnaire containing four potential Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products was administered to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. Despite a primary interest in nature experiences by the majority of visitors, one-third of our sample demonstrated considerable interest in experiences of Aboriginal culture. Results suggest the need for marketing diverse Aboriginal tourism attractions to attract repeat visitors and for offering an introductory experience to Aboriginal culture for first-time visitors.</abstract><remote-database-name>Taylor and Francis+NEJM</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14724040802695991</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-06-25 23:16:22</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kutzner, Diana</author><author>Wright, Pamela A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An investigation into key market segments for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>Journal of Vacation Marketing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Vacation Marketing</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Vacation Marketing</abbr-1></periodical><pages>97-110</pages><volume>16</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>tl'azt'en</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010-04-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1356-7667</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1356766709357487</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Aboriginal tourism is increasingly seen as a strategy for economic diversification by many Aboriginal communities. While demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America has been demonstrated, little is known about visitor product preferences. This information is needed, however, by Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. Using a psychographic segmentation methodology, we surveyed visitors to northern British Columbia who expressed an interest in Aboriginal tourism to explore their interest in specific features of potential Aboriginal tourism products. Three distinct clusters were identified as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on each First Nation’s level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with tourists.</abstract><remote-database-name>SAGE Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1177/1356766709357487</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:42:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kurz, W.

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000–2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m-2 yr-1 on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959–1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v452/n7190/abs/nature06777.html</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-07-03 17:30:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kuparinen, Katja</author><author>Heinimö, Jussi</author><author>Vakkilainen, Esa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>World's largest biofuel and pellet plants – geographic distribution, capacity share, and feedstock supply</title><secondary-title>Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biofuels, Bioproducts and Biorefining</full-title><abbr-1>Biofuels, Bioprod.

The majority of biomass is used for residential purposes in developing countries. Modern biomass use in industrialized countries is increasing, and more and more biomass is also traded to be used for energy purposes. The purpose of this paper is to locate the 15 largest ethanol, biodiesel, and wood pellet plants. Facilities generating heat, steam and electricity were left out. Secondly it is not generally known what share of biomass users are large plants. Also an effort is made to find out how much these large-scale biomass refining plants use imported feedstock. For the most part, very large industrial processing facilities are found in a small number of countries. The largest ethanol mills are found almost exclusively in the United States, with one very large plant in the Netherlands. The distribution of biodiesel and wood pellet plants is more dispersed. The countries with the most large biodiesel plants include the USA, Brazil, Spain, and the Netherlands. The countries with the most very large wood pellet plants include the USA, Canada, Russia, and Germany. Torrefaction and pyrolysis technologies are still rarely used on industrial scale. Ethanol and wood pellet plants tend to be sourced from local feedstocks, while biodiesel plants are much more likely to use imported feedstocks or a mix of imports and local biomass. All of these fuels are increasingly traded through the international market. © 2014 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bbb.1516/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 17:25:29</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krehbiel, Richard B.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Common Visions: In fluences of the Nisga;a Final Agreement on Lheidli T'enneh Negotiations in the BC Treaty Process</title><secondary-title>International Journal on Minority and Group Rights</secondary-title><short-title>Common Visions</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal on Minority and Group Rights</full-title></periodical><pages>279-288</pages><volume>11</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-08-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1571-8115</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1163/1571811042801975</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Rati fication of the Nisga&amp;apos;a Final Agreement has had an inevitable effect on the conduct of negotiations for First Nations in the British Columbia treaty process.

Victoria's skilled shipbuilder James Trahey was brought north to superintend construction, and steam was raised on 9 May. From 1863 to 1869 the Enterprise worked diligently and profitably throughout a long season on the Upper Fraser Route, but in the latter year she looked to be facing retirement when Wright replaced her with the larger, more powerful sternwheeler Victoria . The Omineca gold rush and Wright's questing nature however reprieved her from oblivion. Well aware of the transportation economies offered by steamboating, Wright determined to send the Enterprise with a supply of goods on a voyage of discovery to see if the Omineca country could be served by a water route. In 1871 she was taken through the Cottonwood and Fort George Canyons to Fort George, then up the Nechako to the Stuart River, up the Stuart to Stuart Lake, up Tachie River to Trembleur Lake, and then up Middle River and Takla Lake to Takla Landing, a feat never equalled in river navigation in British Columbia. Had the Omineca boom been more sustained, who knows what might have taken place in the way of steamboat development.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/cbcacurrent/docview/205000082/abstract/64809FD44D6649FDPQ/288?</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-10 21:33:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Adelson, Naomi</author><author>Olding, Michelle</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Narrating Aboriginality On-Line: Digital Storytelling, Identity and Healing</title><secondary-title>The Journal of Community Informatics</secondary-title><short-title>Narrating Aboriginality On-Line</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>The Journal of Community Informatics</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>First Nations</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Access</keyword><keyword>Community Information</keyword><keyword>Digital Storytelling</keyword><keyword>Social Cohesion</keyword><keyword>youth</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012-11-28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1712-4441</isbn><abstract>Digital story-telling is a counter-narrative of healing for many indigenous youth in Canada today.  As much as e-health technologies are valuable and empowering an interventionist presumption limits the potential value of digital communication as a healing resource.

How and where to include aboriginal needs and goals has however been problematic. Ultimately, aboriginal forest values need to be considered with scientific strategies and their role and compatibility with forest conditions needs to be explored. Criteria and indicator (C&amp;amp;I) frameworks can be used as a platform to include community needs and goals in management decisions. This review compares aboriginal forest ecological perspectives defined by Canadian local level C&amp;amp;I frameworks with non-aboriginal local level C&amp;amp;I frameworks to identify their differences at the indicator level. Three major themes mark the differences between aboriginal and non-aboriginal indicators: (1) aboriginal frameworks introduce ecological indicators of cultural importance; (2) there is an aesthetic concern for forest operations especially if they affect cultural owners; and (3) indicators regarding the access to resources are more complex and include the sustainability of the productivity, proximity, integrity and quality of resources used in traditional activities. Results show that First Nation forest sustainability issues are in effect a combination of forest conditions and values. Inclusion of forest values in C&amp;amp;I frameworks is necessary because: (1) aboriginal communities do not dissociate culture from the environment and thus forest values from forest condition, (2) they have an impact on resulting forest management strategies and decisions, and (3) they offer a holistic approach to sustainability issues and a better picture of local environmental contexts.</abstract><research-notes>Location: Tl'azt'en</research-notes><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112708000091</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2014-06-28 17:41:37</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dodsworth, Tera-Lee</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A cross plant comparison of an ERP/MRP system</title></titles><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>unbc.arcabc.ca</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A6074/</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-24</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Edwards, R.

Over time, this has resulted in an erosion of traditional practices and a decline in overall health. There is concern that mental health practitioners are not meeting the needs of the Carrier people because they fail to understand the Carrier worldview. In an effort to better understand and respect the Carrier ideas and beliefs about mental health and mental illness, interviews were conducted with 7 traditional healers about their beliefs and their practices. The traditional healers reported that the concept of mental illness did not exist in pre-contact culture. However, the traditional healers who participated in this research actively practise ceremonies and rituals that seek to restore balance and harmony between the person and his or her environment.</abstract><remote-database-name>cjcmh.com (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.cjcmh.com/doi/abs/10.7870/cjcmh-2015-018</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-29 21:28:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Desreumaux, Quentin</author><author>Côté, Pascal</author><author>Leconte, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Role of hydrologic information in stochastic dynamic programming: a case study of the Kemano hydropower system in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering</secondary-title><short-title>Role of hydrologic information in stochastic dynamic programming</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Civil Engineering</full-title><abbr-1>Can.

We will show how choosing the best hydrological variables can strongly affect management policies. This is especially true for the system studied here, namely the Kemano hydroelectric system located in British Columbia, Canada, which is subject to large streamflow volumes due to significant snow cover during winter. Real-time snow water equivalent (SWE) data can be used directly as a variable in SDP management policies. Results indicate that for the system in this study, the maximum SWE (i.e., highest level of SWE observed from the start of winter to the current decision period) is the best among the methods investigated for effective, safe management, compared with Markov or order p autoregressive models when forecasts are not available., Cet article présente une étude décrivant l’effet de diverses variables hydrologiques de la programmation stochastique dynamique (SDP) pour résoudre le problème d’optimisation pour gérer un système hydroélectrique. Nous allons démontrer comment le choix des meilleures variables hydrologiques peut fortement influencer les politiques de gestion. Cela est particulièrement vrai pour le système à l’étude, le système hydroélectrique de Kemano, en Colombie-Britannique, Canada. Il est soumis à de grands débits en raison de l’importante couche de neige durant l’hiver. Les données d’équivalence en eau de la neige, en temps réel, peuvent être directement utilisées comme variables dans les politiques de gestion SDP.

Variation at 14 microsatellite loci was surveyed for sea-type and lake-type Sockeye Salmon and Kokanee sampled from 121 populations in the two river drainages. An index of genetic differentiation, F-ST, over all populations and loci was 0.087, with individual locus values ranging from 0.031 to 0.172. Standardized to an ecotype sample size of 275 individuals, the least genetically diverse ecotype was sea-type Sockeye Salmon with 203 alleles, whereas Kokanee displayed the greatest number of alleles (260 alleles), with lake-type Sockeye Salmon intermediate (241 alleles). Kokanee populations from the Columbia River drainage (Okanagan Lake, Kootenay Lake), the South Thompson River (a major Fraser River tributary) drainage populations, and the mid-Fraser River populations all clustered together in a neighbor-joining analysis, indicative of a monophyletic origin of the Kokanee ecotype in these regions, likely reflecting the origin of salmon radiating from a refuge after the last glaciation period. However, upstream of the mid-Fraser River populations, there were closer relationships between the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype and the Kokanee ecotype, indicative of the Kokanee ecotype evolving independently from the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype in parallel radiation. Kokanee population structure within the entire Fraser River drainage suggested a polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage. Studies employing geographically restricted population sampling may not outline accurately the phylogenetic history of salmonid ecotypes.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bates, L.

Larvae were sampled 8, 16, and 24 days post-hatch. Larvae were larger when reared with substrate and at warmer temperatures. For whole body cortisol, a significant age by temperature interaction was observed with the highest values on day 16 for larvae from warm water treatments. Larvae reared in gravel consistently showed significantly lower whole body cortisol than larvae reared without substrate. In response to mechanical agitation, there was a significant effect of time following disturbance. Increased growth and reduced stress hormone levels make substrate rearing of yolksac larvae an important technique for enhancement efforts in artificial and natural environments. The positive effects of temperature on growth, however, with higher whole body cortisol, suggest that larval white sturgeon development may be better at cooler temperatures.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jai.12570/abstract</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bangham, Ralph V.</author><author>Adams, James R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Survey of the Parasites of Freshwater Fishes from the Mainland of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada</full-title><abbr-1>J.

This paper aims to contribute to the growing body of research on long-term company-community relations. An analysis of the relationship between Alcan (Aluminum of Canada, Montréal, Canada part of Rio Tinto since 2007) with the Cheslatta Carrier First Nation in the Kemano-Kitimat area of northern British Columbia, Canada, provides three contributions. The first is related to the notion of relational legacy, which refers to the sedimentation of unresolved issues that have the potential to impede the realization of corporate activities and the reproduction of low levels of social license to operate. The second concerns stakeholder management. While the literature suggests that stakeholders should be managed by companies according to the degree of salience, this analysis suggests that researchers and managers should consider the evolution of the environmental context in their analyses. Third, the analysis suggests that small or marginalized groups, depicted by the stakeholder management literature as dormant stakeholders, should not be underestimated.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.mdpi.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.mdpi.com/2076-3387/4/1/15</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-08-11 19:08:02</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ashmore, P.</author><author>Conly, F.

This review of recent research focuses on the themes of sediment yield, land-use impact, fine-sediment transport, bed material transport and river morphology and numerical modelling of fluvial landscape development. Research on sediment yield and denudation has confirmed that Canadian rivers are often dominated by riparian sediment sources. Studies of the effects of forestry on erosion, in-stream sedimentation and habitat are prominent, including major field experimental studies in coastal and central British Columbia. Studies of fine-sediment transport mechanisms have focused on the composition of particles and the dynamics of flocculation. In fluvial dynamics there have been important contributions to problems of turbulence-scale flow structure and entrainment processes, and the characteristics of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. Although much of the work has been empirical and field-based, results of numerical modelling of denudational processes and landscape development also have begun to appear. The nature of research in Canada is driven by the progress of the science internationally, but also by the nature of the Canadian landscape, its history and resource exploitation. Yet knowledge of Canadian rivers is still limited, and problems of, for example, large pristine rivers or rivers in cold climates, remain unexplored. Research on larger scale issues of sediment transfer or the effects of hydrological change is now hampered by reductions in national monitoring programmes. This also will make it difficult to test theory and assess modelling results. Monitoring has been replaced by project- and issues-based research, which has yielded some valuable information on river system processes and opened opportunities for fluvial scientists. However, future contributions will depend on our ability to continue with fundamental fluvial science while fulfilling the management agenda.

Seedling survival and growth were assessed at the end of the first and fifth growing seasons and compared with the growth of naturally regenerated lodgepole pine seedlings on the adjacent cutover areas. Foliar nutrient content, soil bulk density, and soil nutrient pool were also compared between the two areas.Auger planting significantly improved early survival of bareroot stock but had no effect on initial survival rate of container-grown seedlings. The planting method had no significant effect on subsequent growth of either stock type. However, growth of seedlings that were planted on the landings was significantly poorer than that of natural regeneration on the adjacent cutovers. Higher soil density and a significantly reduced soil nutrient pool contributed one third and two thirds, respectively, to this observed growth reduction. Such results suggest that some form of site rehabilitation should be considered if planted trees are to reach their full growth potential on these landings.</abstract><remote-database-name>pubs.cif-ifc.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://pubs.cif-ifc.org/doi/abs/10.5558/tfc64121-2</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 19:31:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Armstrong, John Edward</author><author>Tipper, Howard W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Glaciation in north-central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>American Journal of Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>American Journal of Science</full-title><abbr-1>Am J Sci</abbr-1></periodical><pages>283-310</pages><volume>246</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1948</year><pub-dates><date>1948-05-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-9599, 1945-452X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2475/ajs.246.5.283</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.ajsonline.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.ajsonline.org/content/246/5/283</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:18:31</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Archibald, Jo-ann</author><author>Jovel, Eduardo</author><author>McCormick, Rod</author><author>Vedan, Richard</author><author>Thira, Darien</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Creating Transformative Aboriginal Health Research: The BC ACADRE at Three Years</title><secondary-title>Canadian Journal of Native Education; Edmonton</secondary-title><short-title>Creating Transformative Aboriginal Health Research</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Canadian Journal of Native Education; Edmonton</full-title></periodical><pages>4-11,146-148</pages><volume>29</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Community</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Learning</keyword><keyword>ethics</keyword><keyword>Native peoples</keyword><keyword>College students</keyword><keyword>Councils</keyword><keyword>Cultural values</keyword><keyword>education</keyword><keyword>Ethnic Interests</keyword><keyword>Houses</keyword><keyword>Mental depression</keyword><keyword>Native American Studies</keyword><keyword>Partnerships</keyword><keyword>Research &amp; development--R&amp;D</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>07101481</isbn><abstract>This article traces three years of progress related to building Aboriginal health research capacity with Aboriginal people, communities, and postsecondary institutions through the efforts of the BC Aboriginal Capacity and Developmental Research Environment (ACADRE) network. Extensive Aboriginal community consultations throughout BC resulted in the identification of seven community-determined research theme priorities: traditional healing, knowledge, and practices; addictions and mental health-treatment and transitions; health care programs and policy; health promotion and best practices; Elders' well-being; ethics-research and practice; and capacity-building in and access to research. Various research partnerships with Aboriginal community, health, and educational organizations resulted in the development of research awareness workshops, pilot studies, provincial forums to share research experiences, learning research modules, and the development of community-specific ethical protocols. A significant outcome of the BC ACADRE has been funding and mentoring support for numerous high school, undergraduate, master's, and doctoral students engaged in Aboriginal health education and research.

Held by local people and organizations, small tenures generate expectations that forest management will reflect a broad range of community values for forest use. Woodlot Licences and Community Forest Agreements (CFAs) are small, area-based, long-term licences that grant exclusive rights to manage and harvest timber on public land. Community Forest Agreements also include limited rights to botanical non-timber forest products. All tenures, whether large or small, carry rules established by the provincial forestry legislative and regulatory framework. Award and renewal of cfas is conditional upon demonstrating community support and receiving a satisfactory performance evaluation by the British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range. Small tenures are growing in popularity, but account for only a tiny fraction of the provincial forest land base and allowable annual cut. Despite their size, there are big expectations that woodlots and community forests will introduce new ways of managing forests in British Columbia.</abstract><remote-database-name>jem-online.org</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://jem-online.org/forrex/index.php/jem/article/view/512</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 22:48:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartman, G.

The Kemano project of the Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd. begun in 1950, was the largest industrial scheme in the area. A key feature of the first stage of it was a dam which diverted about 40% of flow of the south branch of the Nechako River, through a tunnel in the mountains, to the Pacific Ocean. In 1987 an agreement for the Kemano Completion Project (KCP), which would have diverted 87% of the flow, was signed. This final phase of the project would have put important fisheries resources of the upper Fraser River at high risk. Mitigation for fisheries protection were inadequate or untested in the system at the time. Potential cumulative impacts of water abstraction, elevated pollution levels, increased water temperature and natural sediment were not addressed. In January 1995 KCP was cancelled but there remain at present no adequate measures to protect the fish and the river ecosystem. These measures are to be negotiated in the future. Future management of the whole Kemano development must provide biologically realistic flow and temperature regimes in the Nechako River, and must deal with cumulative impacts of population and industrial growth. To achieve ‘sustainability’ of fisheries in the Nechako River and upper Fraser watershed the present approach to the Kemano development must be changed fundamentally. The future of the Kemano development must be set in the context of the whole future of the upper Fraser system. Continued growth and development, as has occurred in the upper Fraser and total basin, can not go on without inimical changes to ecosystem conditions and loss of fisheries resources.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00222540</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2019-08-20 15:24:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gustavsona, Kent</author><author>Lonergana, Stephen</author><author>Ruitenbeekb, Jack</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Selection and modeling of sustainable development indicators: a case study of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Ecological Economics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecological Economics</full-title></periodical><pages>117-132</pages><volume>28</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>A large number of groups in British Columbia and Canada as a whole have expended considerable effort to define sustainable development goals and, to a lesser extent, select sustainable development indicators. Many hope that collection and monitoring of such indicators will provide important policy guidance to decision-makers and provide a means for tracking sustainable development. This project was designed with the following goals: (i) to select indicators that could be linked to an operational definition for sustainable development within the Fraser River Basin (British Columbia); (ii) to assess the accessibility, quality and relevance of the best available data for developing such indicators; (iii) to apply modeling techniques for discerning the linkages among indicators; and (iv) to provide recommendations for further indicator selection and modeling research. The major methodological conclusions reached were: (i) it is important to link sustainable development goals to movements of a small slate of individual indicators as single indicators can rarely be linked to any specific sustainable development goal; (ii) the poor quality, inaccessibility and irrelevance of existing data are pervasive constraints to reliable indicator modeling; (iii) modeling is most appropriate at aggregated spatial scales such as provinces or large watersheds, while modeling at smaller ecosystem-based spatial levels is feasible but unreliable; and (iv) linking the use of deterministic and qualitative modeling approaches is a useful means for projecting indicators and discerning important policy linkages, while conventional statistical modeling approaches are frequently inappropriate because of unreliable or non-commensurable data. This has profound implications for indicator selection and modeling. In contrast to much of the current indicator work, which relies on selecting a large number of detailed specific indicators, it would be more fruitful and less costly to focus attention on a small number of indicators within selected indicator classes (such as economic, social, environmental or human health indicators). The precise specification of the indicator within each of these classes is of less consequence. Indicator modeling work should focus on larger scale systems, as opposed to smaller ecosystem units. Such work is most suited to identifying qualitative policy trade-offs and implications, rather than to forecasting specific indicators. Data gathering efforts can be scaled down substantially and should be informed, but not unduly constrained, by available model frameworks. Greater focus is required on modeling frameworks that can use incomplete data sets or qualitative information, and linking existing quantitative model structures to external qualitative models.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800998000329</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-11-23 01:05:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gislason, Maya K.</author><author>Morgan, Vanessa Sloan</author><author>Mitchell-Foster, Kendra</author><author>Parkes, Margot W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Voices from the landscape: Storytelling as emergent counter-narratives and collective action from northern BC watersheds</title><secondary-title>Health &amp; Place</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health &amp; Place</full-title><abbr-1>Health &amp; Place</abbr-1></periodical><pages>191-199</pages><volume>54</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Northern British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Blue and green spaces</keyword><keyword>Digital storytelling</keyword><keyword>Resource extraction</keyword><keyword>Watershed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018-11-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1353-8292</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.healthplace.2018.08.024</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The 'Ecohealth and Watersheds in Northern BC'' project, situated in a resource rich, settler colonial context, generated three digital stories at the request of the project's Steering Committee members that sought to connect health, environment, and community.

In this paper we investigate this apparent epenthesis effect, which is otherwise unexpected in this environment in Dakelh and is problematic in several aspects (Gessner 2003). We propose that the epenthesis should be understood as an anti-homophony effect (Crosswhite 1999, Blevins 2004a, b) serving to systematically maintain a surface distinction between paradigmatically related forms differing in valence. We demonstrate how the anti-homophony effect is best understood in a diachronic-evolutionary context rather than a synchronicphonological one: “epenthesis” is really the blocking of syncope (as a regular historical sound change). The account constitutes a striking parallel to the explanation of so-called antigemination effects as the result of syncope blocking through homophony avoidance, as proposed by Blevins (2004a, b).</abstract><remote-database-name>journals.linguisticsociety.org</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/BLS/article/view/920</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:08:30</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harvey, AG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>David Douglas in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>British Columbia Historical Quarterly</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Columbia Historical Quarterly</full-title></periodical><pages>221-243</pages><volume>4</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>biographical_information</keyword><keyword>botanical_description</keyword><keyword>david_douglas</keyword><keyword>exploration</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1940</year><pub-dates><date>1940-10</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>David Douglas was the first to specialize in the botany of the North-west, and systematically comb the territory for specimens. Making his headquarters at Fort Vancouver, in the State of Washington, he travelled up and down the Columbia by canoe or on foot, sometimes with an Indian guide, sometimes with the Hudson’s Bay Company’s men, but often alone with his dog. Difficult and exhausting as were his journeys, he was happy in the rich harvest of plants which he obtained. His expectations were fully realized. During the six months following his arrival in the country he collected about 500 different specimens (499 to be exact), obtaining as far as possible from 12 to 24 samples of each specimen. Little escaped the keen observation of the young student of natural history. His attention was not confined to vegetation; specimens of birds, insects, and animals were also obtained. After two years’ painstaking labour in the Columbia River region from 1825 to 1827, and a very hard journey south towards California to find the sugar pine he returned to England. After a two years’ sojourn in England, during which he was feted and lionized for his botanical discoveries, he came back to Western America in 1830. This time he came trained and equipped for doing work quite different from that formerly undertaken, having added the taking of geographical and astronomical observations to his former pursuits. Leaving Fort Vancouver March 20, 1833, he travelled with the express as far as Fort Okanagan. Douglas also undertook the making of field-sketches along the route and did a continuous series of the country travelled from Fort Okanagan to the Quesnel River, showing the natural configuration, with notes on trees, vegetation, and soil. Leaving Fort Kamloops the brigade went on to Fort Alexandria, where the horses were changed for boats. The journey was also up-stream on the Nechako and Stuart rivers. Douglas went up the Nechako to Fort Fraser, on Fraser Lake, and probably went overland from there to Fort St. James. After a very brief stay at Fort St. James, during which he took some observations, he and Johnson embarked in a small birch-bark canoe and descended the Stuart and Nechako rivers. At Fort George they stayed a day or two with George Linton, clerk in charge there, and then began descending the Fraser. And now disaster was added to disappointment. On June 13, at the “Stony Islands,” as he called them, they were wrecked in the rapids; the canoe was smashed to pieces. Douglas was carried down the rapids and into the whirlpool below, and he was swept about in the turbulent waters for an hour and forty minutes, before being washed on to the rocky shore. He lost everything he had except his instruments, his astronomical journal, notes and charts, and his barometrical observations. The last months of Douglas’s life were spent in the Sandwich Islands. He arrived in Honolulu in December, 1833, and spent the next few months in exploring the island of Hawaii. He collected a large number of ferns. The two great volcanic peaks attracted him and he climbed both, being the first white man to do so. As usual, he endured terrible hardships. In August, 1834, while crossing the island alone with his dog he fell into a pit used for trapping wild cattle, and was gored to death. Some say he was pushed in, and in this way murdered for his money. Whichever it was, it was a horrible death, and an untimely one, for he was only 34 years old. As the pioneer botanist of North-west America and California, Douglas made their flora known to the world. The number of plants which he introduced to England in the form of root, seed, or cutting is remarkable.

The bones lay in silty pond deposits in a bedrock depression, and were overlain by a thin layer of gravel and a thick layer of glacial till. Although no molar teeth were found, limb proportions show that the specimen was a large mammoth, like the Columbian mammoth (Mammuthus cf. M. columbi). Two radiocarbon dates of 42 900 ± 1860 yr B.P. and 43 800 ± 1830 yr B.P. on wood from the silty fossiliferous layer, and another of 34 000 ± 690 yr B.P. on mammoth bone suggest that the animal sank in sticky pond deposits and died there. Paleobotanical evidence indicates that, during this part of the Olympia Interglaciation, the vegetation near Babine Lake was similar to present shrub tundra just beyond the treeline in northern Canada., Les ossements d'un squelette de mammouth partiellement articulé ont été découverts au cours du décapage d'affleurements à un site minier du lac Babine au centre de la Colombie Britannique. Les ossements étaient dans le silt lacustre d'une dépression rocheuse et étaient recouverts d'une mince couche de gravier puis d'une épaisse couche de till glaciaire. Même si on n'a pas trouvé de molaires, les proportions des membres indiquent que le mammouth était gros, comme le mammouth colombien (Mammuthus cf. M. columbi). Deux déterminations d'âge au carbone radioactif de 42 900 ± 1860 ans et de 43 800 ± 1830 ans sur du bois de la couche silteuse, et une autre de 34 000 ± 690 ans sur un os du mammouth lais sent croire que l'animal s'est enlisé dans les dépôts gluants de l'étang et en est mort. Les vestiges paléobotaniques indiquent que, durant l'intergalaciaire Olympia, la végétation près du lac Babine était comme celle de la toundra actuelle juste au nord de la limite des arbres du nord canadien.

This is not  surprising given  the  historical  destruction of First Nations  families  and  communities as a result  of colonization. Many would  argue that current  child welfare practices continue on where  residential schools  left  off  in  implementing government assimilation policies. Approximately 30% of all children  in care in Canada  are Aboriginal (Fournier  and  Crey, 1998).  This is no different  in British Columbia. In the northern half of the province  the number of Aboriginal children  in continuing  care  is  as  high  as  80% (Children's  Commission Annual  Report,  1998).   The need  for  culturally sensitive  child welfare  practices  is critical  to  First  Nations  communities and families. With the opening of a new northern university in 1992, University of Northern British Columbia, there  was a renewed hope   by  northern  First  Nations   leaders   for  a  Social  Work program that  would  meet  their  needs  as well as support their vision  for a future  of self sufficiency and  independence.   This paper   describes   one  small   step   in  that   vision,   that   is, the development of First  Nations  Social Work  courses.    To better understand this development process it is first important to be aware of the context in which it was undertaken.</abstract><remote-database-name>zone.biblio.laurentian.ca</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://zone.biblio.laurentian.ca/handle/10219/413</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-29 23:32:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Greenwood, Margo</author><author>Lindsay, Nicole</author><author>King, Jessie</author><author>Loewen, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethical spaces and places: Indigenous cultural safety in British Columbia health care</title><secondary-title>AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples</secondary-title><short-title>Ethical spaces and places</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples</full-title><abbr-1>AlterNative: An International Journal of Indigenous Peoples</abbr-1></periodical><pages>179-189</pages><volume>13</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1177-1801</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1177180117714411</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article discusses transformations underway within Indigenous health in northern British Columbia and Canada. We highlight two organizations that are working to create ethical space and cultural safety at the intersections of Indigenous knowledge about health and wellness, Western medicine, and healthcare services for Indigenous peoples in Canada. The article argues that the cultural, organizational, and systemic transformations necessary to address the deep and ongoing health inequities experienced by Indigenous populations should be rooted in Indigenous knowledges and should prioritize Indigenous voices, values, and concepts. Cultural safety, ethical space, and Two-Eyed Seeing are three examples of ideas anchored in Indigenous knowledges that speak to relationships at the interface of different systems of knowledge. We offer some examples of how a public health knowledge translation centre and a regional health service delivering organization are actualizing these concepts in their work nationally and regionally in northern British Columbia, Canada.</abstract><remote-database-name>SAGE Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1177/1177180117714411</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-10-07 18:06:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picketts, IM</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Curry, JA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Incorporating climate change adaptation into local plans</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>984-1002</pages><volume>57</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>COMMUNITY</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>LESSONS</keyword><keyword>adaptation</keyword><keyword>community plan</keyword><keyword>local plan</keyword><keyword>sustainability plan</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0964-0568,1360-0559</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/09640568.2013.776951</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Local governments can encourage proactive action on climate change by incorporating adaptation measures into long-term planning documents. The authors undertook action-oriented, case study research by participating (as adaptation experts) in the process to create a sustainability and land use policy plan for the City of Prince George, Canada. A range of adaptation measures was incorporated into both documents. Factors enabling the incorporation of adaptation included a high level of local awareness, an existing adaptation strategy to draw upon and the flexible process used to create the plans. Challenges such as a lack of priority, limited policy direction and perceptions of climate change as solely an environmental challenge persist as barriers to incorporating adaptation into local plans, particularly in smaller centres.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;54</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picketts, IM</author><author>Curry, J</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Cohen, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Learning with practitioners: climate change adaptation priorities in a Canadian community</title><secondary-title>CLIMATIC CHANGE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIMATIC CHANGE</full-title></periodical><pages>321-337</pages><volume>118</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>CITIES</keyword><keyword>QUANTITATIVE METHODS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0165-0009,1573-1480</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10584-012-0653-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Adaptation is already a necessary response to climate change for northern communities. The City of Prince George, in British Columbia, Canada, has been adjusting to impacts for years and there is a high level of local awareness of climate change. The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities. Other impacts, such as health effects and agricultural changes, are also important but did not rank highly using a risk framework focused on negative physical effects. Local impacts, actions the City is undertaking to address them and suggestions for implementing adaptation measures are summarized. The process of creating an adaptation strategy has proven highly valuable in Prince George and has precipitated further engagement and action. Due to the low profile of adaptation and limited resources in many communities, researchers and practitioners must capitalize on opportunities to incorporate adaptation into existing plans and processes. Lessons from the Prince George experience can be applied to other communities as they strive to effectively adapt to climate change.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picketts, IM</author><author>Andrey, J</author><author>Matthews, L</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Tighe, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change adaptation strategies for transportation infrastructure in Prince George, Canada</title><secondary-title>REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REGIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE</full-title></periodical><pages>1109-1120</pages><volume>16</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Transportation</keyword><keyword>FRAMEWORK</keyword><keyword>Adaptation</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>Local government</keyword><keyword>DIALOGUE</keyword><keyword>Road maintenance</keyword><keyword>Road safety</keyword><keyword>WEATHER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1436-3798,1436-378X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10113-015-0828-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Transport infrastructure is particularly vulnerable to climate impacts as it is designed for long operational lives, and both episodic and seasonal conditions contribute to deterioration, disruption and unsafe incidents. There are some examples of adaptation in transportation design, but many communities do not have the capacity to incorporate climate change considerations into infrastructure planning and management. Researchers worked closely with the City of Prince George, in Central British Columbia, Canada, to build on existing work and explore how the City could plan, design, and maintain roads and other structures to account for climate change. A local steering committee was formed, and created and evaluated 23 potential research topics. Two focus areas were selected for further investigation and explored during a workshop with practitioners, researchers, consultants and other representatives. The workshop precipitated an investigation of projected impacts of climate change on road maintenance and road safety, and plans to explore alternative paving techniques. Outcomes of the case study provide insights regarding climate change and local transportation infrastructure, including: how researchers can engage with local experts to explore adaptation; issues local governments perceive as important; and barriers communities face as they attempt to address vulnerabilities.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picketts, IM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The best laid plans: Impacts of politics on local climate change adaptation</title><secondary-title>ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE &amp; POLICY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE &amp; POLICY</full-title></periodical><pages>26-32</pages><volume>87</volume><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Adaptation</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>Local government</keyword><keyword>Policy</keyword><keyword>Politics</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1462-9011,1873-6416</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envsci.2018.05.017</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Academics and champions seeking to guide and implement proactive climate change adaptation must be aware of how local political factors can be a barrier or a benefit to action. With a wave of support, the City of Prince George, Canada, pursued adaptation initiatives for six years; however, part way through the project, political changes resulted in a local governmental shift in focus. Semi-structured interviews with local experts reflect on how political changes affected the nature and legacy of adaptation in Prince George. Respondents indicated that the new political regime was not anti-environmental but explicitly focused on reducing costs, which meant minimizing studies and providing essential services. Initiatives related to transportation infrastructure and land use planning continued to move forward, whereas issues related to flooding and ecosystems were stalled. Plans and strategies that make clear links to costs and actions, and where the public clearly understands how inactions will affect them, are more likely to move forward in a less supportive political environment. Redundancies in capacity are important to maintain institutional memory. Effective communication is essential for stakeholders to understand why local governments should invest in adaptation, and to potentially present adaptation as a positive unifying direction for a community.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Picketts, IM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Practitioners, priorities, plans, and policies: assessing climate change adaptation actions in a Canadian community</title><secondary-title>SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>503-513</pages><volume>10</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>VULNERABILITY</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>Adaptation policy</keyword><keyword>ADAPTIVE CAPACITY</keyword><keyword>Assessment</keyword><keyword>Capacity building</keyword><keyword>Climate change adaptation</keyword><keyword>Climate impacts</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>Mainstreaming</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1862-4065,1862-4057</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11625-014-0271-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There is a paucity of research that evaluates climate change adaptation actions. Academics partnered with the City of Prince George, in Northern British Columbia, Canada, for over five years to explore and address adaptation. After an adaptation strategy was created, eight initiatives oriented towards implementation were pursued. These initiatives focused on incorporating adaptation into local plans, and in-depth explorations of impacts related to forests, river flooding and effects to transportation infrastructure. This article summarizes the initiatives pursued and assesses their effectiveness through semi-structured interviews with local planners, engineers, managers, community champions and politicians. The initiatives deemed to be most successful-and most likely to continue after the project has ended-focus on topics that: are of high public concern; have clear cost implications; incorporate adaptation into policy; and/or promote tangible outcomes. Results highlight both benefits and drawbacks associated with 'mainstreaming' adaptation into existing plans and strategies, and the importance of building and maintaining internal capacity.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Petticrew, EL</author><author>Arocena, JM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of iron-phosphate as a source of internal lake phosphorus loadings</title><secondary-title>SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>87-93</pages><volume>266</volume><number>1-3</number><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>anoxia</keyword><keyword>internal loading</keyword><keyword>iron phosphate</keyword><keyword>MINTEQA2</keyword><keyword>phosphorus</keyword><keyword>RELEASE RATES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0048-9697</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00756-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Biological, physical and chemical characteristics of the water column of a shallow (z(max) = 9.2 m), small (surface area 3.8 km(2)) residential and recreational lake near Prince George, British Columbia, indicated that the system was being loaded internally with phosphorus (P) from the sediments. The abundance of P released from the fine glaciolacustrine, and organic rich sediments was resulting in excess algal and weed growth. It was postulated that iron-phosphate reduction at redox potentials below approximately 200 mV and/or bacterially mediated orthophosphate (PO4-P) releases could be occurring. The development of an appropriate nutrient management strategy required that the process associated with the sediment P release be determined. The MINTEQA2 geochemical model was used to predict the release of orthophosphate (PO4-P) into the interstitial water with the assumption that P is present alternately as strengite, variscite and hydroxyapatite. The predicted release of PO4-P from these P containing minerals was compared to the concentration of PO4-P and total phosphorus (TP) in the overlying hypolimnion. In order to improve the accuracy of the model prediction, the proportion of the sediment present as iron-bound phosphate was estimated. A significant correlation between the observed hypolimnetic TP and interstitial PO4-P concentrations as predicted from iron-bound P dissolution (r(2) = 0.59) was found. Total phosphorus release rates to the hypolimnion were also found to be strongly correlated to the iron-bound P component of the sediment (r(2) = 0.88). Multivariate regression analyses showed significant relationships between hypolimnetic PO4-P and sediment iron-bound P, Eh, and interstitial Fe (r(2) = 0.76). These results provided sufficient evidence to conclude that PO4-P in the system is predominantly bound to Fe-containing minerals and therefore could be managed using treatment techniques that address iron-bound phosphates.

N, P, and N + P additions were contrasted with controls to determine the responses of periphyton and macroinvertebrates over a 33-day period in late spring. Periphyton accrual under N + P addition was greater than two times that of the controls, and N alone produced a moderate increase. Periphyton showed relatively little response to P addition compared with controls. Macroinvertebrates, especially orthocladiine midges and mayflies, increased in density under N or N + P additions, in contrast with P additions and controls. Increased emergence rates of adult aquatic insects from the mesocosms were consistent with increases observed in benthic invertebrates. The results showed nutrient Limitation of benthic productivity and that algal and benthic invertebrate responses were closely coupled. N was most Limiting, but with additions of inorganic N as low as 10 mu g . L-1, P became limiting. The benthic invertebrates that increased most in abundance corresponded to the predominant prey in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) fry diets at the time of the experiment.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;50 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Jongbloed, KA</author><author>Pooyak, SD</author><author>Blaira, AH</author><author>Christian, WM</author><author>Sharma, R</author><author>Mazzuca, A</author><author>Zamar, DS</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: exploring determinants of psychological distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs in three Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GLOBAL MENTAL HEALTH</full-title></periodical><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>drug use</keyword><keyword>SUBSTANCE-ABUSE</keyword><keyword>SEXUAL-ABUSE</keyword><keyword>ABORIGINAL PEOPLE</keyword><keyword>HISTORICAL TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>NON-INJECTION DRUGS</keyword><keyword>CHILD-ABUSE</keyword><keyword>Childhood maltreatment</keyword><keyword>Indigenous young people</keyword><keyword>MENTAL-HEALTH INTERVENTION</keyword><keyword>NEW-ZEALAND</keyword><keyword>psychological distress</keyword><keyword>RACIAL-DISCRIMINATION</keyword><keyword>VIOLENT VICTIMIZATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2054-4251</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/gmh.2018.26</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background.Mental health and wellbeing, including addressing impacts of historical trauma and substance use among young people, has been identified as a key priority by Indigenous communities and leaders across Canada and globally. Yet, research to understand mental health among young Indigenous people who have used drugs is limited.Aims.To examine longitudinal risk and strengths-based factors associated with psychological distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs.Method.The Cedar Project is an ongoing cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver, Prince George, and Chase, British Columbia, Canada. This study included participants who completed the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised, returned for follow-up between 2010 and 2012, and completed the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire. Adjusted linear mixed-effects models estimated effects of study variables on changes in area T-scores of psychological distress.Results.Of 202 eligible participants, 53% were women and the mean age was 28 years. Among men, childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect), any drug use, blackouts from drinking, and sex work were associated with increased distress. Among women, childhood maltreatment (emotional abuse, physical abuse, physical neglect), blackouts from drinking, and sexual assault were associated with increased distress, while having attempted to quit using drugs was associated with reduced distress. Marginal associations were observed between speaking their traditional language and living by traditional culture with lower distress among men.Conclusion.Culturally safe mental wellness interventions are urgently needed to address childhood trauma and harmful coping strategies that exacerbate distress among young Indigenous people who use drugs.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;90</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Blair, AH</author><author>Teegee, M</author><author>Pan, SW</author><author>Thomas, V</author><author>Zhang, HB</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project*: Historical Trauma and Vulnerability to Sexual Assault Among Young Aboriginal Women Who Use Illicit Drugs in Two Canadian Cities</title><secondary-title>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</full-title></periodical><pages>313-329</pages><volume>21</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>COMMUNITIES</keyword><keyword>drug use</keyword><keyword>FRAMEWORK</keyword><keyword>INJECTION</keyword><keyword>INTERPERSONAL VIOLENCE</keyword><keyword>PARTNER VIOLENCE</keyword><keyword>POSTTRAUMATIC-STRESS-DISORDER</keyword><keyword>REDUCTION</keyword><keyword>sexual assault</keyword><keyword>SUBSTANCE-ABUSE</keyword><keyword>young Aboriginal women</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1077-8012,1552-8448</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/1077801214568356</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study explored trends of sexual assault and associated risk factors within a cohort of young Aboriginal women who used drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, Canada, between 2003 and 2010.

A presumed metamorphic equivalent of Jurassic volcanic rocks of the Stikine terrane gives epsilon(Nd) = +6, and a number of other metaigneous and metasedimentary rocks in the core of the Coast Mountains give epsilon(Nd) values from +3 to +7. A single metasedimentary rock approximately 3 km east of the Work Channel shear zone gives a epsilon(Nd) value of -9. Coast Belt plutons in the traverse yield epsilon(Nd) from -1 to +2. The Omineca Belt plutons give epsilon(Nd) from -10 to -17. All results are consistent with published data in demonstrating that (i) juvenile origins for both igneous and metamorphic rocks are common in the Coast Belt; (ii) representatives of a continental-margin sedimentary sequence with Precambrian crustal Nd are tectonically interleaved in the Coast Mountains; (iii) Coast Mountains plutons can be interpreted as derived from a blend of metamorphic rocks like those seen at the surface, or as are-type melts contaminated with the older crustal component; and (iv) Omineca Belt plutons are dominated by remelted Precambrian crustal rocks.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Patakfalvi, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Canfor corporation's Mill operations in Prince George with Brett Robinson at the Helm</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>22-23</pages><volume>105</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004,1923-3515</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parnel, R</author><author>Garrod, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Going metric-How Intercontinental and Prince George Converted.</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>64-69</pages><volume>79</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>1978</year><pub-dates><date>1978</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parkes, MW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>River conversations: A confluence of lessons and emergence from the Taieri River and the Nechako River</title><secondary-title>RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>RIVER RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>443-452</pages><volume>38</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>ECOSYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>catchment</keyword><keyword>confluence</keyword><keyword>eco-social</keyword><keyword>emergence</keyword><keyword>MAORI</keyword><keyword>Nechako River</keyword><keyword>river</keyword><keyword>SETTINGS</keyword><keyword>SOUTH ISLAND</keyword><keyword>Taieri River</keyword><keyword>watershed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1535-1459,1535-1467</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/rra.3907</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Drawing on ongoing patterns of learning and relationship, this paper offers a reflection and acknowledgement on the notable influence of two rivers and their role as respected and highly valued "eco-social elders": The Taieri River in Otago, New Zealand, and the Nechako River in northern British Columbia, Canada. The paper is motivated by the question: "If a river has 'voice', what can be learned from the emergence arising from rivers 'in conversation'?". At the heart of the reflection are the themes of confluence and emergence-ways in which we grasp the coming together of things, especially when that combination is more than the sum of their parts. The paper aims to explore a "conversation" between the river teachings of the Taieri River and the Nechako River, identifying examples of patterns and connections between distinct river "voices," and how these may contribute to emergence and ongoing conversations among different rivers and their teachings. The paper commences with an introduction to both rivers, identifying points of direct comparison and contrast, then moving to explore themes of confluence, weaving and emergence, combining ecological, metaphorical, and personal perspectives. The conversation then progresses downstream to river-ocean relationships, reflecting on rivers as eco-social elders that inspire conversations, provide a sense of home, and offer a point of reference to consider the wider influence on rivers and waterways on the health of diverse species within catchments and across the planet.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;64</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pan, SW</author><author>Christian, CWM</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Blair, AH</author><author>Jongbloed, K</author><author>Zhang, HB</author><author>Teegee, M</author><author>Thomas, V</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: Impacts of policing among young Aboriginal people who use injection and non-injection drugs in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY</full-title></periodical><pages>449-459</pages><volume>24</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>REDUCTION</keyword><keyword>PREVENTION</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal people</keyword><keyword>PERCEPTIONS</keyword><keyword>CITY</keyword><keyword>PUBLIC-HEALTH</keyword><keyword>CONFIDENCE</keyword><keyword>Drug use</keyword><keyword>LAW-ENFORCEMENT</keyword><keyword>Longitudinal</keyword><keyword>Mixed-methods</keyword><keyword>OVERDOSE MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>Policing</keyword><keyword>SYRINGE EXCHANGE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0955-3959,1873-4758</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.drugpo.2013.04.009</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Policing has profound health implications for people who use illicit drugs. Among Aboriginal communities, distrust of police is common, due partly to legacies of colonial policing. In response to the paucity of research among Aboriginal people who use drugs, this paper aims to: (1) Describe the policing experiences of young Aboriginal people who use drugs; (2) Identify policing activities associated with unsafe injection practices; and (3) Elucidate barriers to positive police relations. Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. This mixed-methods study (N=372) used period prevalence from 2007 to 2010 to describe policing experiences, mixed effects regression models to identify correlates of policing activities, and thematic qualitative analysis to assess attitudes to police relations. Results: Many participants were stopped by police (73%), experienced physical force by police (28%), had drug equipment confiscated (31%), and changed location of drug use because of police (43%). Participants who reported dealing drugs (40%) were significantly more likely to experience police engagement. Among participants in Prince George, 4% reported to have had non-consensual sex with members of the criminal justice system. Policing activity was significantly associated with syringe sharing, rushed injection, and reused syringe. Due to personal experience, practical concerns, and intergenerational legacies of unfair policing practices, most participants did not want a positive relationship with police (57%). Desire for a positive relationship with police was directly associated with being helped by police, and inversely associated with being stopped by police and experiencing physical force by police. Conclusion: Policing activities may be impacting the well-being of Aboriginal people who use drugs. Due to focused prosecution of street-level drug dealing, some police may favor enforcement over harm reduction. Positive police engagement and less aggressive policing may enhance perceptions of police among young Aboriginal people who use drugs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

As part of the modernization, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins), Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) were affected. Prescribers and pharmacists had six months to discuss the changes with patients, and change medications if deemed necessary. Purpose: To quantify the changes made to prescriptions and to adjust to the Modernized Reference Drug Program. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two clinics in Prince George, BC. Charts for patients that were prescribed any drugs in the affected classes were reviewed to determine if, and when, they had been changed, and by which health care professional. In December 2016, a clinical pharmacist, integrated within the study clinics, informed prescribers of the changes, and made patient-specific clinical notes within the charts. The notes described the changes and recommended alternative agents and appropriate dosing in order to assist the prescriber to have a conversation with the patient regarding the switch. Results: Out of 429 unique patients, 233 patients were prescribed a Statin, 229 patients an ACEI, 110 an ARB and, 83 a CCB. Sixty-five drug changes were indicated to reflect the modernization, and with guidance from a clinical pharmacist, nurse practitioners (NPs), and family physicians (FPs), 65% of these identified drugs were switched to reflect the modernization. Community pharmacists made no drug changes in the study sample, despite the prescriptive authority and compensation available to do so. Province-wide, approximately 21% to 33% of affected drugs were switched during the same time-frame. Direct collaboration between a clinical pharmacist, working alongside NPs and FPs, was more successful in optimizing these medications when compared to standard practice, or community pharmacists alone.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Padilla, A</author><author>Rasouli, K</author><author>Dery, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impacts of variability and trends in runoff and water temperature on salmon migration in the Fraser River Basin, Canada</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES</full-title></periodical><pages>523-533</pages><volume>60</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>SURVIVAL</keyword><keyword>DISCHARGE</keyword><keyword>water temperature</keyword><keyword>snow</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>Fraser River Basin</keyword><keyword>salmon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0262-6667,2150-3435</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02626667.2014.892602</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The 1911-2010 variability in monthly runoff and the effect of 1995-2005 summer water temperatures in a highly productive salmon system, the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, Canada are explored. Hydrometric data from 141 FRB gauges provide variations in monthly runoff including their extremes and months of occurrences, as well as trends in their variability. Stream temperatures and their relationships to runoff are also assessed. There is a gradual increase of monthly runoff ranges from the central plateau of the FRB towards higher altitudes with maxima in glacier-fed alpine streams. Maximum and minimum monthly runoff across the FRB typically occur during May-June and February, respectively. There is a tendency towards greater FRB variability in July runoff. Water temperatures show high variability in the unregulated North and South Thompson rivers and low variability in the regulated Nechako River. FRB low flows are associated with higher water temperatures, while high flows are associated with cooler ones, both of which may have a negative impact on salmon. [GRAPHICS] Editor Z.W.

The watershed provides critical reproductive habitats for anadromous chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and year-round habitat for the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) population. In this study, the chemical quality of sediment in the upper Nechako River and its major tributaries was examined for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), legacy organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and furans (PCDFs), labile (exchangeable) metals/metalloids, and major nutrients (N and P). sigma PCB and sigma PBDE were detected in channel bottom sediments at all Nechako River and tributary sites; hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 4,4 '-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) were also detected at most sites. Organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides were not detected in any samples. While sigma PCB, sigma PBDE, HCB, and 4,4 '-DDE concentrations in bottom sediments were always well below provincial and federal guidelines for the protection of aquatic life, concentrations of total labile As (As-T), Cr-T, Cu-T, Fe-T, Mn-T, Ni-T, and Zn-T in suspended and/or bottom sediments often exceeded provincial threshold effect levels (TEL) and, in some cases, approached or exceeded probable effect levels. Distinct Cu-T, Ni-T, Pb-T and Zn-T concentration maxima in suspended sediments were linked to road and urban densities. Historical PCDD, PCDF and PAH data show that concentrations in bottom sediment samples were highest at a site in the lower Nechako River between Miworth and the City of Prince George where PCDD and PCDF concentrations exceeded the interim federal TEL. Nitrogen and P concentrations in bottom sediments were negatively correlated with water velocity and sediment texture; the evidence suggests that reductions in velocity resulting from the 1952 diversion of the Nechako River have increased the nutrient content of bottom substrates.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;68</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owens, PN</author><author>Caley, KA</author><author>Campbell, S</author><author>Koiter, AJ</author><author>Droppo, IG</author><author>Taylor, KG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Total and size-fractionated mass of road-deposited sediment in the city of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada: implications for air and water quality in an urban environment</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</full-title></periodical><pages>1040-1051</pages><volume>11</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Road dust</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>SPECIATION</keyword><keyword>CONTAMINATION</keyword><keyword>Air and water quality</keyword><keyword>DUSTS</keyword><keyword>Grain-size distribution</keyword><keyword>HEAVY-METALS</keyword><keyword>MANCHESTER</keyword><keyword>PHOSPHORUS-CONTENT</keyword><keyword>PM10 and PM2.5</keyword><keyword>Road-deposited sediment</keyword><keyword>STREET SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>TEMPORAL VARIABILITY</keyword><keyword>Urban sediment</keyword><keyword>YORKSHIRE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1439-0108,1614-7480</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11368-011-0383-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose The urban sedimentary system is attracting increasing interest because of its role in influencing air and water quality. A large amount of road-deposited sediment (RDS) lies on the road network of Prince George, a city of about 80,000 people, in British Columbia, Canada. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the total mass of RDS within the city, and how this varied over time and space; and (2) to determine the temporal and spatial variations in the particle-size fractions of the RDS. Materials and methods Samples of RDS were collected using a grid network during two different time periods in the snow-free season in 2009. Composite samples for each grid (n = 46) were fractionated into five grain-size classes (&gt; 500, 250-500, 125-250, 63-125, &lt; 63 mu m) using stainless steel sieves. Fractionated sediment samples were weighed to obtain a mass for each size class for each grid cell. Results and discussion The total amount of RDS (all particle-size fractions) in the city of Prince George was estimated to be 746 x 10(3) and 204 x 10(3) kg for the summer and fall 2009 sampling periods, respectively. Based on a total road length of 1,030 km within the sampled area of the city, this equates to an average of 724 and 198 kg per km of road, for the summer and fall sampling periods, respectively. The RDS was dominated by the &gt; 500-mu m fraction, and there was a trend of decreasing amounts (by mass) for the finer particle-size fractions. In terms of the most important particle-size fraction from an air and water quality perspective, the &lt; 63-mu m particle-size fraction accounted for, on average, 6.5% and 4.8% of the total RDS mass for the summer and fall 2009 sampling periods, respectively; it is estimated that an additional approximately 2% was lost to the air during sample collection, and thus values may be closer to 9% and 7%, respectively. This equates to averages of between 47-61 and 10-13 kg per km of road for the summer and fall periods, respectively. Total amounts of RDS were greatest in the city centre, compared to the outlying areas, reflecting the greater density of roads in the former, although there were some hotspots which may reflect land use activities such as light-industry and pulp and paper mills. Conclusions These findings have implications for air and water quality in the city and surrounding area, including the role of RDS in contributing to airborne fine particulates (i.e. PM10 and PM2.5) and the fine-grained sediment (&lt; 63 mu m) transported within storm sewers to receiving waterways, such as the Fraser and Nechako Rivers.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;55</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owens, JN</author><author>Bennett, J</author><author>L'Hirondelle, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Pollination and cone morphology affect cone and seed production in lodgepole pine seed orchards</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>383-400</pages><volume>35</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>SEXUAL REPRODUCTION</keyword><keyword>SPRUCE</keyword><keyword>TIME</keyword><keyword>EFFICIENCY</keyword><keyword>EMBRYO</keyword><keyword>MECHANISM</keyword><keyword>OVULE</keyword><keyword>SELF-POLLINATION</keyword><keyword>SET</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067,1208-6037</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/X04-176</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We describe the phenology and mechanisms of pollen-cone and seed-cone development in lodgepole pine in the interior of British Columbia and the methods for monitoring cone phenology, pollination, seed production, and causes of seed and cone losses in seed orchards over the 15-month reproductive cycle. Pollination lasted about 2 weeks, between mid-May and mid-June. Pollen shedding and female receptivity showed homogamy, protandry, or protogyny depending on weather, site, and year. Morphological and developmental features explain why pollination as early as stage 3 was most successful and why self-pollination led to a seriously reduced production of filled seed. Early pollination increased the seed potential per cone and consequently the filled seed per cone. Cone drop occurred when less than 80% of ovules were pollinated per cone and was higher in trees from Prince George than those in the Okanagan Valley. Misting of trees and mechanical blowing of pollen in the orchards did not increase filled seed per cone. Clonal effect was the most important factor in all trials and has implications for orchard management.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ouellet-Proulx, S</author><author>St-Hilaire, A</author><author>Boucher, MA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water Temperature Ensemble Forecasts: Implementation Using the CEQUEAU Model on Two Contrasted River Systems</title><secondary-title>WATER</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WATER</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>PRECIPITATION</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>uncertainty</keyword><keyword>UNCERTAINTY</keyword><keyword>STREAM</keyword><keyword>ensemble forecasts</keyword><keyword>water temperature</keyword><keyword>river management</keyword><keyword>modeling</keyword><keyword>regulated river</keyword><keyword>FISHERIES MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>PREDICTION</keyword><keyword>REGIMES</keyword><keyword>VERIFICATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2073-4441</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/w9070457</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In some hydrological systems, mitigation strategies are applied based on short-range water temperature forecasts to reduce stress caused to aquatic organisms. While various uncertainty sources are known to affect thermal modeling, their impact on water temperature forecasts remain poorly understood. The objective of this paper is to characterize uncertainty induced to water temperature forecasts by meteorological inputs in two hydrological contexts. Daily ensemble water temperature forecasts were produced using the CEQUEAU model for the Nechako (regulated) and Southwest Miramichi (natural) Rivers for 1-5-day horizons. The results demonstrate that a larger uncertainty is propagated to the thermal forecast in the unregulated river (0.92-3.14 degrees C) than on the regulated river (0.73-2.29 degrees C). Better performances were observed on the Nechako with a mean continuous ranked probability score (MCRPS) &lt;0.85 degrees C for all horizons compared to the Southwest Miramichi (MCRPS approximate to 1 degrees C). While informing the end-user on future thermal conditions, the ensemble forecasts provide an assessment of the associated uncertainty and offer an additional tool to river managers for decision-making.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ouellet-Proulx, S</author><author>Chiadjeu, OC</author><author>Boucher, MA</author><author>St-Hilaire, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assimilation of water temperature and discharge data for ensemble water temperature forecasting</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>342-359</pages><volume>554</volume><keywords><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>Water temperature</keyword><keyword>MODELS</keyword><keyword>Data assimilation</keyword><keyword>Discharge</keyword><keyword>Ensemble forecasts</keyword><keyword>Particle filter</keyword><keyword>Uncertainty</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>PREDICTION</keyword><keyword>HYDROLOGICAL DATA ASSIMILATION</keyword><keyword>KALMAN FILTER</keyword><keyword>INTERPOLATION</keyword><keyword>SCORING RULES</keyword><keyword>SOLAR-RADIATION</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW OBSERVATIONS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-1694,1879-2707</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2017.09.027</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent work demonstrated the value of water temperature forecasts to improve water resources allocation and highlighted the importance of quantifying their uncertainty adequately. In this study, we perform a multisite cascading ensemble assimilation of discharge and water temperature on the Nechako River (Canada) using particle filters. Hydrological and thermal initial conditions were provided to a rainfall-runoff model, coupled to a thermal module, using ensemble meteorological forecasts as inputs to produce 5 day ensemble thermal forecasts. Results show good performances of the particle filters with improvements of the accuracy of initial conditions by more than 65% compared to simulations without data assimilation for both the hydrological and the thermal component. All thermal forecasts returned continuous ranked probability scores under 0.8 degrees C when using a set of 40 initial conditions and meteorological forecasts comprising 20 members. A greater contribution of the initial conditions to the total uncertainty of the system for 1-dayforecasts is observed (mean ensemble spread = 1.1 degrees C) compared to meteorological forcings (mean ensemble spread = 0.6 degrees C). The inclusion, of meteorological uncertainty is critical to maintain reliable forecasts and proper ensemble spread for lead times of 2 days and more. This work demonstrates the ability of the particle filters to properly update the initial conditions of a coupled hydrological and thermal model and offers insights regarding the contribution of two major sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in thermal forecasts.

They also support the notion that the Cache Creek Terrane is allochthonous with respect to the North American craton. The 177 conodont collections, assigned to 20 faunas, range in age from Bashkirian (Late Carboniferous) to Norian (Late Triassic); 70 radiolarian collections representing 12 zones range from Gzhelian (Late Carboniferous) to Toarcian (Early Jurassic); 335 collections assigned to 11 fusulinacean assemblages (with associated foram-algal associations) range from Bashkirian to Wordian (Middle Permian); and two coral faunas are of Bashkirian and Wordian age. The fossils document a long but sporadic history of sedimentary events within the Cache Creek Complex that included two major carbonate buildups in the Late Carboniferous (Pope limestone) and Middle Permian (Copley limestone), punctuated by intervening Early Permian deepening; basaltic eruptions during the mid Carboniferous and mid Permian; the onset of oceanic chert sedimentation close to the Carboniferous-Permian boundary and its persistence through the Late Triassic (Sowchea succession); latest Permian and Early Triassic mixed clastics and volcanics (Kloch Lake succession); Middle and Late Triassic reworking of carbonates (Whitefish limestone), including cavity fill in older limestones (Necoslie breccia), and fine-grained clastic sedimentation extending into the Early Jurassic (Tezzeron succession). Tethyan, eastern Pacific, and (or) low-latitude biogeographic attributes of the faunas are noted in the Gzhelian (fusulines), Artinskian (conodonts, fusulines), Wordian (fusulines, corals, conodonts), and Ladinian (conodonts, radiolarians). The Cache Creek Terrane lay far to the west of the North American continent during these times.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;54 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;55 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;104</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Onwukwe, C</author><author>Jackson, PL</author><author>Dery, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intercomparison of atmospheric forcing datasets and two PBL schemes for precipitation modelling over a coastal valley in northern British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS</full-title></periodical><volume>29</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>precipitation</keyword><keyword>SIMULATION</keyword><keyword>SENSITIVITY</keyword><keyword>atmospheric forcing data</keyword><keyword>complex terrain</keyword><keyword>DATA SETS</keyword><keyword>FORECASTS</keyword><keyword>HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT</keyword><keyword>IMPROVEMENTS</keyword><keyword>model skill</keyword><keyword>OROGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>PBL schemes</keyword><keyword>PHYSICAL PARAMETERIZATIONS</keyword><keyword>RESOLUTION</keyword><keyword>WRF</keyword><keyword>WRF MODEL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1350-4827,1469-8080</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/met.2043</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Environmental modelling of remote areas requires dynamical downscaling of meteorological data to obtain precipitation values that could substitute for sparse in-situ observations. This study examined numerical simulations of precipitation over the Terrace-Kitimat Valley, an industrializing corridor in the Coast Mountains of northern British Columbia, Canada. Modelling uncertainty was explored for 1 year of output from the Weather Research and Forecasting model at 1-km grid spacing for three atmospheric forcing datasets and two planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes. The observed total precipitation ranged from 1170 to 2380 mm and was often underestimated by more than 40% when using the North American Regional Reanalysis as atmospheric forcing data or the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino level 3 (MYNN3) parameterization as PBL scheme. Persistent low bias from model configurations using these configurations suggested that merely selecting an alternative atmospheric forcing dataset does not ameliorate systematic error occasioned by a poorly performing PBL parameterization. Hence, the choice of the PBL scheme and the meteorological dataset is important for spatial estimation of precipitation using WRF. Model output best corresponded with annual gauge measurements when simulations with the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL scheme were forced with ERA5. The North American Mesoscale Analyses (NAM-ANL) however demonstrated better performance for monthly variation and high-intensity precipitation than ERA5. Using both datasets therefore may be valuable for calculations related to environmental change. With either NAM-ANL or ERA5 as atmospheric forcing data and MYJ as the PBL scheme, the uncertainty in annual simulated precipitation amount ranged between 38% overestimation and 21% underestimation of observational data.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;62</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ogwang, T</author><author>Wang, BT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A hedonic price function for a Northern BC community</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>285-296</pages><volume>61</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>CHOICE</keyword><keyword>FORM</keyword><keyword>hedonic price function</keyword><keyword>least absolute deviation</keyword><keyword>least squares</keyword><keyword>residential housing</keyword><keyword>valuation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300,1573-0921</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1021905518866</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper a hedonic price function for Prince George, a northern British Columbia community, is estimated.

Repeated personal exposure measures (10 per subject) of 15 children and ambient concentrations at their neighbourhood schools were collected for a 6-week winter period in 2001. PM2.5 mass, sulphate (SO42-) and light absorbing carbon (ABS) were determined for all samples and the relationship between ambient concentration and personal exposure was investigated. Overall, lower particle exposures and a lower personal-ambient regression slope were found for Prince George children compared to results from other longitudinal studies of children. This suggests that in this setting indoor environments may have less influence from ambient sources and greater influence from non-ambient sources. Comparison of personal exposures and ambient concentrations for each individual indicated higher Spearman correlations for SO42- (median = 0.95) and ABS (median = 0.73) compared to total PM2.5 mass (median = 0.55). A large degree of individual variability in the personal-ambient correlation was found for PM2.5 mass, while SO42- showed very consistent results, supporting its use as an indicator of exposure to particulate matter of ambient origin. ABS was slightly more variable than SO42- due to the influence of non-ambient or very local sources in a low number of samples. The impact of local meteorology was also investigated and inversion conditions were connected to all high ambient levels (&gt; 30 mu g m(-3)). In addition, associations were found between inversion strength and personal exposure. This finding suggests that reduction of ambient concentrations during stagnant periods would result in lower personal exposure levels. This study highlights the importance of both ambient and non-ambient sources, supports the use of both SO42- and ABS as tracers of background ambient particle exposure and demonstrates the significant effect of winter meteorology on both outdoor levels and personal exposure in a valley community.

Personal exposures to PM2.5 were measured in children at 5 elementary schools located throughout the city and ambient samples were collected on school rooftops. Average ambient levels and personal exposures during this time period were 13.8 mu g m(-3) and 16.4 mu g m(-3) respectively. From the data pooled across individuals, use of the two different tracers indicated identical estimates of median exposure to ambient PM2.5 (7.5 mu g m(-3)) and similar estimates of non-ambient generated exposure (6.4 and 5.0 mu g m(-3)) and infiltration (0.49 and 0.52) for the sulphate and elemental carbon approach, respectively. The median fraction of the ambient concentration resulting in exposure or exposure factors were 0.54 and 0.55 respectively, however lower values of 0.46 and 0.42 were determined from regression analysis. A strong association was found between exposure to ambient PM2.5 and measured ambient concentrations at both the closest school monitor (median r = 0.92) and a central site (median r = 0.88) demonstrating that the central site monitor was suitable for assessing longitudinal ambient generated exposure throughout the city. These results support the use of elemental carbon as a tracer of ambient generated exposure and the use of ambient data as estimates of longitudinal changes in children's exposure in this setting. The importance of both ambient and non-ambient sources of PM2.5 is emphasized by their almost equal contribution to total personal exposures. Comparison with other studies suggests a limited influence of climate and the cold season in Prince George on exposure levels and found similar mean non-ambient generated exposures despite large variability across and within subjects in any given location.

Understanding their genetic relatedness and host specificity is relevant to the risk assessment of viral insecticides if non-target impacts are to be avoided. DNA polymerase gene sequences have been demonstrated to be useful for inferring genetic relatedness among dsDNA viruses. We have adopted this approach to examine the relatedness among natural isolates of two uncharacterized caterpillar-infecting baculoviruses, Malacosoma californicum pluviale nucleopolyhedrovirus (McplMNPV) and Malacosoma disstria nucleopolyhedrovirus (MadiMNPV), which infect two closely related host species with little to no cross-infectivity. We designed two degenerate primers (BVP1 and BVP2) based on protein motifs conserved among baculoviruses. McplMNPV and MadiMNPV viral DNA was obtained from naturally infected caterpillars collected from geographically distinct sites in the Southern Gulf Islands and Prince George regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sequencing of 0.9 kb PCR amplicons from six McplMNPV and six MadiMNPV isolates obtained from a total of eight sites, revealed very low nucleotide variation among McplMNPV isolates (99.2-100% nucleotide identity) and among MadiMNPV isolates (98.9-100% nucleotide identity). Greater nucleotide variation was observed between viral isolates from the two different caterpillar species (only 84.7-86.1% nucleotide identity).

Approximately 52 per cent of Indigenous peoples in Canada live in urban areas. In spite of high rates of urbanization, urban Indigenous peoples are overlooked in health care policy and services. Because of this, although health care services are more plentiful in cities as compared to rural areas, Indigenous people still report significant barriers to health care access in urban settings. This qualitative study, undertaken in Prince George, Canada, examines perceived barriers to health care access for urban Indigenous people in light of how colonialism impacts Indigenous peoples in their everyday lives. The three most frequently reported barriers to health care access on the part of the 65 participating health care providers and Indigenous clients of health care services are: substandard quality of care; long wait times; and experiences of racism and discrimination. These barriers, some of which are common complaints among the general population in Canada, are interpreted by Indigenous clients in unique ways rooted in experiences of discrimination and exclusion that stem from the settler colonial context of the nation. Through the lenses of cultural safety and ethical space frameworks developed by international Indigenous scholars in efforts to better understand and operationalize relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous individuals and societies in the context of settler colonialism this study offers an understanding of these barriers in light of the specific ways that colonialism intrudes into Indigenous clients' access to care on an everyday basis.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;61</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelson, SE</author><author>Wilson, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rights and health versus rights to health: Bringing Indigenous Peoples ' legal rights into the spaces of health care services</title><secondary-title>POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY</full-title></periodical><volume>85</volume><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>VOICE</keyword><keyword>WOMEN</keyword><keyword>VIOLENCE</keyword><keyword>Indigenous peoples</keyword><keyword>BARRIERS</keyword><keyword>Indigenous rights</keyword><keyword>Colonialism</keyword><keyword>EQUITY</keyword><keyword>GAP</keyword><keyword>GEOGRAPHIES</keyword><keyword>Health care services</keyword><keyword>Social determinants of health</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0962-6298,1873-5096</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.polgeo.2020.102311</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The political-legal discourse of Indigenous rights continues to be separated from discussions of health care services in geographic scholarship, due to the ways in which political-legal, settler-colonial definitions of rights fail to take Indigenous understandings into account, as well as a distrust on the part of scholars of the limited and contingent notion of "rights." While Indigenous rights, inherently tied in Canada to recognition by the settler colonial state, have limited application in achieving social justice or decolonization for Indigenous peoples, we argue that Indigenous rights can be used as a complementary discourse to Indigenous resurgence, within broader discourses of Indigenous justice, to lend legal and political weight to arguments for cultural safety and human rights in health care. We draw on a study conducted with 50 Indigenous community members and 15 health services professionals in the northern city of Prince George, Canada, to elucidate how Indigenous peoples' experiences in health care settings may be improved by giving attention to rights discourse and removing the geographic and identity-based limitations of Indigenous rights to health care in Canada.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;77</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelson, SE</author><author>Wilson, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Indigenous health organizations, Indigenous community resurgence, and the reclamation of place in urban areas</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>24-35</pages><volume>65</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>CULTURAL SAFETY</keyword><keyword>EXPERIENCES</keyword><keyword>health services</keyword><keyword>Indigenous health</keyword><keyword>Indigenous resurgence</keyword><keyword>PEOPLE</keyword><keyword>PRIMARY-CARE</keyword><keyword>Prince George</keyword><keyword>urban</keyword><keyword>VOICE</keyword><keyword>WOMEN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12618</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research around the world has been nearly unanimous about the positive impacts of Indigenous-led health organizations on Indigenous peoples' qualitative experiences in health care, in the face of often negative experiences in non-Indigenous-led health care settings. Urban environments, including health care environments, are areas of increasing attention with regard to Indigenous peoples' health in Canada. In this study, which took place in the northern city of Prince George, British Columbia, 65 Indigenous community members and health services workers participated in interviews and focus groups, describing their experiences with urban Indigenous-led health organizations-defined in this study as non-governmental organizations that prioritize the values and practices of local Indigenous communities. Employing perspectives on place and relationships drawn from Indigenous critical theory and Indigenous community resurgence to analyze the findings of this qualitative study leads to a focus on how relationships impact and can even constitute places, enabling new understandings of the roles of Indigenous-led health organizations in urban Indigenous community resurgence.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;66</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nelson, SE</author><author>Rosenberg, MW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Age-Friendly Cities and Older Indigenous People: An Exploratory Study in Prince George, Canada</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>273-282</pages><volume>41</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>aging</keyword><keyword>qualitative research</keyword><keyword>Prince George</keyword><keyword>CARE</keyword><keyword>Indigenous people</keyword><keyword>age-friendly communities</keyword><keyword>ELDERS</keyword><keyword>WELL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0714-9808,1710-1107</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S071498082100009X</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Cities around the world are responding to aging populations and equity concerns for older people by developing age-friendly communities plans, following the World Health Organization's guidelines. Such plans, however, often fail to account for the wide diversity of older people in cities, with the result that some older people, including Indigenous older people, do not see their needs reflected in age-friendly planning and policies. This article reports on a study involving 10 older First Nations and Metis women in the city of Prince George, Canada, comparing the expressed needs of these women with two age-friendly action plans: that of the city of Prince George, and that of the Northern Health Authority. Four main categories were raised in a group discussion and interview with these women at the Prince George Native Friendship Centre: availability of health care services, accessibility and affordability of programs and services, special roles of Indigenous Elders, and experiences of racism and discrimination. There are many areas of synergy between the needs expressed by the women and the two action plans; however, certain key areas are missing from the action plans; in particular, specific strategies for attending to the needs of Indigenous and other older populations who often feel marginalized in health care and in age-friendly planning.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Natola, L</author><author>Seneviratne, SS</author><author>Irwin, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Population genomics of an emergent tri-species hybrid zone</title><secondary-title>MOLECULAR ECOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MOLECULAR ECOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>5356-5367</pages><volume>31</volume><number>20</number><issue>20</issue><keywords><keyword>HYBRIDIZATION</keyword><keyword>DIVERGENCE</keyword><keyword>SPECIATION</keyword><keyword>genotyping-by-sequencing</keyword><keyword>hybridization</keyword><keyword>introgression</keyword><keyword>sapsucker</keyword><keyword>SAPSUCKERS SPHYRAPICUS</keyword><keyword>Sphyrapicus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0962-1083,1365-294X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/mec.16650</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Isolating barriers that drive speciation are commonly studied in the context of two-species hybrid zones. There is, however, evidence that more complex introgressive relationships are common in nature. Here, we use field observations and genomic analysis, including the sequencing and assembly of a novel reference genome, to study an emergent hybrid zone involving two colliding hybrid zones of three woodpecker species: red-breasted, red-naped, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, S. nuchalis, and S. varius). Surveys of the area surrounding Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, show that all three species are sympatric, and Genotyping-by-Sequencing identifies hybrids from each species pair and birds with ancestry from all three species. Observations of phenotypes and genotypes of mated pairs provide evidence for assortative mating, though there is some heterospecific pairing. Hybridization is more extensive in this tri-species hybrid zone than in two di-species hybrid zones. However, there is no evidence of a hybrid swarm and admixture is constrained to contact zones, so we classify this region as a tension zone and invoke selection against hybrids as a likely mechanism maintaining species boundaries. Analysis of sapsucker age classes does not show disadvantages in hybrid survival to adulthood, so we speculate the selection upholding the tension zone may involve hybrid fecundity. Gene flow among all sapsuckers in di-species hybrid zones suggests introgression probably occurred before the formation of this tri-species hybrid zone, and might result from bridge hybridization, vagrancies, or other three-species interactions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;49</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Narver, DW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary production in 2 small lakes of Northern Interior Plateau of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF THE FISHERIES RESEARCH BOARD OF CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>2189-2193</pages><volume>24</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>1967</year><pub-dates><date>1967</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/f67-178</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Munro, J.

Wildlife responses to forestry cutblocks (defined areas where trees were harvested) vary as a function of forest succession, which differs across systems. Across their distribution, moose (Alces alces) and forestry are often closely associated. Moose are predicted to select for cutblocks because of greater browse quantity in early successional vegetation, but moose responses to cutblocks are inconsistent across studies. Our objective was to compare moose spatial responses to cutblocks as a function of year since cut between study areas (Prince George South [PGS] and Bonaparte [BP]) while considering differences in vegetation composition and regrowth to better inform forestry planning in British Columbia, Canada. We characterized cutblocks by dominant tree species as a proxy for vegetation composition and estimated the normalized burn ratio (NBR) from multispectral satellite imagery as an index of vegetation regrowth (i.e., structure). We then examined the use of cutblocks by moose dependent upon vegetation composition and NBR using generalized additive mixed effects models. Next, we used locations of collared moose and nearby available locations to examine moose responses as a function of year since cut and used those responses to group cutblocks into age classes, which were incorporated into resource selection functions (RSF) to compare moose responses between study areas. Vegetation composition differed between study areas, and although cutblocks in both study areas followed similar regrowth trajectories, NBRs for cutblocks &gt; 13 years post-logging in PGS exceeded those in BP. Moose demonstrated greater use of locations within cutblocks with intermediate NBRs and dominanted by spruce (Picea engelmannii x glauca) versus Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca). Moose responses as a function of year since cut varied seasonally, but across seasons, moose tended to avoid new cutblocks (1-8 years), select for regenerating cutblocks (9-24 years), and avoid older cutblocks (25-40 years). In both study areas, RSFs revealed that moose avoided new cutblocks, but moose in PGS were more likely to select for regenerating cutblocks in comparison to BP. Our analyses suggest that the use of cutblocks by moose is a function of year since cut, vegetation composition, and vegetation regrowth, likely resulting from differences in browse quantity and lateral cover. To maintain stable moose populations, managers should consider vegetation composition and regrowth during forestry planning, and future research should focus on identifying region-specific forestry thresholds for moose.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;57</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mottershead, KD</author><author>McGee, TK</author><author>Christianson, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evacuating a First Nation Due to Wildfire Smoke: The Case of Dene Tha' First Nation</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>274-286</pages><volume>11</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>First Nations</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>Indigenous peoples</keyword><keyword>PLACE</keyword><keyword>SENSE</keyword><keyword>Community resilience</keyword><keyword>COMMUNITY RESILIENCE</keyword><keyword>DISASTER</keyword><keyword>Evacuation planning</keyword><keyword>FIRE SMOKE</keyword><keyword>Wildfire smoke</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2095-0055,2192-6395</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13753-020-00281-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Almost every year, First Nations are evacuated in Canada because of wildfire proximity and smoke. Dynamics of wildfires, and remote locations, unique sociocultural characteristics, and limited emergency management resources present challenges for evacuation organizers and residents. This study explores how Dene Tha' First Nation evacuated their Tache community in July 2012 due to wildfire smoke and how the evacuation process affected evacuees. Interviews were completed with 31 evacuation organizers and residents to examine the factors that helped and hindered the evacuation process. Lack of information about the nearby wildfire, smoke, and evacuation of the nearby small community of Zama City, combined with a generic evacuation plan, delayed and posed challenges during the evacuation of this Dene Tha' community. Strong leadership and its role in community organizing, keeping families together, providing the social support they needed, and using familiar host communities, demonstrated and contributed to the community's resilience during the evacuation. Measures to improve evacuations and emergency management in the community and other First Nations in Canada are identified and discussed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris, P</author><author>Fondahl, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Negotiating the production of space in Tl'azt'en territory, Northern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>108-125</pages><volume>46</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>First Nations</keyword><keyword>aboriginal</keyword><keyword>CARTOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>GEOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>negotiations</keyword><keyword>production of space</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1541-0064.2002.tb00734.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Societies produce the space in which they operate through social practices that visualize, administer, and use lands and resources. Because Native peoples have held relatively little political power, their ability to influence the production of space has received little attention. Yet the superimposition of Euro-Canadian social practices onto Native spaces rarely erased native spatiality, but rather created a territory made up of shared and hybrid spaces which resulted from the interaction of Native and Euro-Canadian societies. This paper suggests that the social processes involved in the production of space are perhaps most visible when two parties are negotiating the allocation and management of lands and resources. In the 1970s the Tl'azt'en engaged in negotiations over the construction of a railway through their territory. Through the negotiations Tl'azt'en social and economic goals were inscribed to a significant degree in the spatial organization of the territory. Like current treaty negotiations, the 1970s negotiations involved compromises by both parties, and resulted in the creation of new hybrid social spaces which reflected the goals and strategies of both groups.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;69</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morris, DJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Logging operations in Prince George area of B.C</title><secondary-title>PULP AND PAPER MAGAZINE OF CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP AND PAPER MAGAZINE OF CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>80</pages><volume>7</volume><number>13</number><issue>13</issue><dates><year>1970</year><pub-dates><date>1970</date></pub-dates></dates><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Morgan, Onyx Vanessa Sloan</author><author>Thomas, Kimberley</author><author>McNab-Coombs, Laura</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Envisioning healthy futures: Youth perceptions of justice-oriented environments and communities in Northern British Columbia Canada</title><secondary-title>Health &amp; Place</secondary-title><short-title>Envisioning healthy futures</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Health &amp; Place</full-title></periodical><pages>1-9</pages><volume>76</volume><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moniruzzaman, A</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Patel, SH</author><author>Chavoshi, N</author><author>Teegee, M</author><author>Adam, W</author><author>Christian, WM</author><author>Henderson, E</author><author>Craib, KJP</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: Correlates of attempted suicide among young aboriginal people who use injection and non-injection drugs in two Canadian cities.</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CIRCUMPOLAR HEALTH</full-title></periodical><pages>261-273</pages><volume>68</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>sexual abuse</keyword><keyword>ABUSE</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal young people</keyword><keyword>ALASKA NATIVE YOUTH</keyword><keyword>suicide attempts</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1239-9736,2242-3982</isbn><abstract>Objectives. Aboriginal leadership and families are deeply concerned about the rate of suicide attempt among their young people. The objectives of this study were to (a) describe the prevalence of suicide attempt and (b) to describe correlates of Vulnerability to Suicide attempts within a cohort of young Aboriginal people who use drugs in 2 Canadian cities. We aimed to Situate file findings within the context of historical and lifetime trauma. Study design. The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving 605 young Aboriginal people aged 14-30 Who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Methods. Multivariable logistic regression modelling identified independent predictors of suicide attempts. Estimates of adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Result.

The Nechako Reservoir was created by the construction of the Kenney Dam in Nechako Canyon, a natural barrier to salmon migration. The Nechako River downstream of Nechako Canyon supports important runs of sockeye and chinook salmon. This additional diversion of Nechako River flow creates the potential of high water temperatures and increased thermal stress to migrating sockeye salmon enroute to their spawning grounds in Nechako River tributaries. To achieve specific downstream water temperature objectives during sockeye salmon migration each summer, a two-level outlet facility adjacent to Kenney Dam is to be constructed to release cooling water at 10 degrees C to the Nechako River. Results of mathematical modelling of Nechako River water temperatures show that, based on specified design criteria, a maximum Kenney Dam release of 167 m(3)/s at 10 degrees C would be required to meet the downstream water temperature objectives.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, KM</author><author>Withler, RE</author><author>Beacham, TD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Molecular evolution at Mhc genes in two populations of chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</title><secondary-title>MOLECULAR ECOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MOLECULAR ECOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>937-954</pages><volume>6</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>population</keyword><keyword>Oncorhynchus tshawytscha</keyword><keyword>CICHLID FISHES</keyword><keyword>II BETA-CHAIN</keyword><keyword>MAJOR-HISTOCOMPATIBILITY-COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>MATING PREFERENCES</keyword><keyword>MHC</keyword><keyword>MINISATELLITE DNA VARIATION</keyword><keyword>MITOCHONDRIAL-DNA</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC NORTHWEST</keyword><keyword>polymorphism</keyword><keyword>salmonid</keyword><keyword>sequence</keyword><keyword>SEQUENCE-ANALYSIS</keyword><keyword>STOCK IDENTIFICATION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0962-1083</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1046/j.1365-294X.1997.00274.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The DNA sequences of four exons of the MHC (major histocompatibilty complex) were examined in chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from an interior (Nechako River) and a coastal (Harrison River) population in the Fraser River drainage of British Columbia. Mhc class I A1, A2 and A3 sequences and a class II B1 sequence were obtained by PCR from each of 16-20 salmon from each population. The class I A1 and a pair of linked A2-A3 exons were derived from two different classical salmonid class I genes, Sasa-A and Onmy-UA, respectively. Allelic variation for B1, A1 and A2 was characterized by the high levels of nonsynonymous substitution indicative of the effects of natural selection on Mhc domains that contain peptide binding regions. The number of alleles detected at each of the four exons ranged from three (B1) to 22 (A1), but levels of nucleotide sequence divergence at all four exons were low relative to classical mammalian Mhc genes. The nucleotide similarity among alleles ranged between 89 and 99% over all exons, and all four domains possessed only two major sequence motifs. Allelic distributions at BZ, A1 and A3 confirmed the genetic distinctiveness of the Harrison and Nechako chinook salmon populations revealed in previous studies. The two major allelic motifs of BI and A1 segregated strongly between the populations. In spite of evidence that allelic diversity at these chinook salmon Mhc exons has been generated by selection, the level and distribution of diversity in the two salmon populations strongly reflected the demographic history of the species, which has been characterized by repeated bottlenecks and isolation-by-distance in glacial refugia.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;64 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;62</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, CL</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Moniruzzaman, A</author><author>Thomas, V</author><author>Christian, W</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: risk factors for transition to injection drug use among young, urban Aboriginal people</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>1147-1154</pages><volume>183</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>HIV INCIDENCE</keyword><keyword>PREVALENCE</keyword><keyword>SEX WORK</keyword><keyword>STREET-INVOLVED YOUTH</keyword><keyword>TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>VANCOUVER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0820-3946,1488-2329</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.101257</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Studies suggest that Aboriginal people in Canada are over-represented among people using injection drugs. The factors associated with transitioning to the use of injection drugs among young Aboriginal people in Canada are not well understood. Methods: The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study (2003-2007) involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants' venous blood samples were tested for antibodies to HIV and the hepatitis C virus, and drug use was confirmed using saliva screens. The primary outcomes were use of injection drugs at baseline and tranisition to injection drug use in the six months before each follow-up interview. Results: Of 605 participants, 335 (55.4%) reported using injection drugs at baseline. Young people who used injection drugs tended to be older than those who did not, female and in a relationship. Participants who injected drugs were also more likely than those who did not to have been denied shelter because of their drug use, to have been incarcerated, to have a mental illness and to have been involved in sex work. Transition to injection drug use occurred among 39 (14.4%) participants, yielding a crude incidence rate of 19.8% and an incidence density of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years. In unadjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use was associated with being female (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-3.72), involved in sex work (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.75-6.40), having a history of sexually transmitted infection (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.07-3.78) and using drugs with sex-work clients (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.32). In adjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use remained associated with involvement in sex work (adjusted OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.45-10.71). Interpretation: The initiation rate for injection drug use of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years among participants in the Cedar Project is distressing. Young Aboriginal women in our study were twice as likely to inject drugs as men, and participants who injected drugs at baseline were more than twice as likely as those who did not to be involved in sex work.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Zumbo, BD</author><author>Hubley, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Health and the quality of life</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>245-286</pages><volume>51</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>OF-LIFE</keyword><keyword>SCALING ASSUMPTIONS</keyword><keyword>SURVEY SF-36</keyword><keyword>CANCER-PATIENTS</keyword><keyword>MENTAL-PATIENTS</keyword><keyword>OLD-AGE</keyword><keyword>PSYCHOSOCIAL ADJUSTMENT</keyword><keyword>RHEUMATOID-ARTHRITIS</keyword><keyword>SUBJECTIVE AGE</keyword><keyword>SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1007010401301</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this investigation was to explain the impact of people's self-reported health on their levels of satisfaction with their health, and the impact of these things plus satisfaction with other specific domains of their lives on the perceived quality of their lives. The latter was operationalized as general happiness, satisfaction with life as a whole and overall satisfaction with the quality of life. Seven hundred and twenty-three (723) usable questionnaires returned from a mailout random sample of 2500 households of Prince George, British Columbia in November 1998 formed the working data-set for our analyses. Among other things, mean respondent scores on the SF-36 health profile were found to be lower than published norms from the UK, USA, Netherlands and Sweden, but higher than scores from Aberdeen, Scotland. Mean scores on the CES-D depression scale also indicated that our respondents tended to have more depressive symptoms than comparison groups in Winnipeg and the USA. A review of trends in mean scores on 17 quality of life items (e.g., satisfaction with family life, financial security, recreation, etc.) from 1994, 1997 and 1998 revealed that there were only 7 statistically significant changes across the four year period and they were all negative. Multivariate regression analysis showed that health status measured with a variety of indicators could explain 56% of the variation in respondents' reported satisfaction with their health. A combination of health status plus domain satisfaction indicators could explain 53% of the variation in respondents' reported happiness, 68% of reported life satisfaction and 63% of reported satisfaction with the overall quality of life. Sixty percent of the explained variation in happiness scores was attributable to self-reported health scores, while only 18% of the explained variation in satisfaction with life and with the overall quality of life scores was attributable self-reported health scores.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;124 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;129 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;105</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Zumbo, BD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Public services and the quality of life</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>125-156</pages><volume>48</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>SATISFACTION</keyword><keyword>HAPPINESS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1006893225196</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This is a report of the results of a survey of citizen beliefs and attitudes about public services and the quality of life in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada in the summer of 1997. Information is provided about the perceived frequency with which various services were used, the perceived satisfaction and value for tax dollars spent on the services as well as on levels of government officials generally, preferences for the provision of more or fewer services and for spending relatively more or less revenue on different services, views about user-fees, and views about smoke-free public places and the likely impact of bylaw changes on people's behaviour. Using such information, we examined correlations among perceived satisfaction, perceived value for money, use, spending preferences and demand, and, using multiple regression analysis, explained 66% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, 57% of the variance in satisfaction with the quality of life scores and 37% of the variance in happiness scores. Applying LISREL 8.14, it was shown that a model in which our three global indicators were explained by 13 domain indicators was superior to a model in which the latter indicators were explained by the former, i.e., a Bottom-Up model was superior to a Top-Down model. A simple linear model was also used to explain 32%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of the variance in satisfaction with municipal, provincial and federal government officials.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;50 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Zumbo, BD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ethnicity, modern prejudice and the quality of life</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>189-222</pages><volume>53</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>SEXISM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1026596132069</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this investigation was to measure levels of ethnic or cultural background diversity, social cohesion and modern prejudice, and the impact of such diversity, cohesion and prejudice on the quality of life. Using a sample of 743 residents of Prince George, British Columbia, we identified diverse ethnic or cultural groups, and created several indexes of heterogeneous social networks and a measure of modern prejudice. Dividing the total sample into three roughly distinct groups containing, respectively, respondents self-reporting an ethnic or cultural background that was aboriginal, non-aboriginal visible minority or anything else, we discovered that all significant comparisons indicated that people with aboriginal backgrounds reported a generally lower quality of life than those in the other two groups. The quality of life scores of the other two groups were practically indistinguishable. Given the demographic structure of our sample, the revealed differences could not be attributed to differences in socio-economic classes. Members of the largest group of respondents tended to be most prejudiced and optimistic, people with aboriginal backgrounds tended to be least prejudiced and optimistic and people with visible minority backgrounds tended to be between the other two groups. Regressions revealed that a variety of ethnic/culture-related phenomena could only explain 8%, 9% and 10%, respectively, of the variation in scores for happiness, life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life. When domain satisfaction scores were added to the set of predictors, we were able to explain 48%, 69% and 54%, respectively, of the variation in scores for happiness, life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life. In the presence of the domain satisfaction scores, the scores on the ethnic/cultural related phenomena added only one percentage point of explanatory power for happiness and life satisfaction, and three percentage points for satisfaction with the overall quality of life. All things considered, then, it is fair to say that this project showed that ethnic or cultural background diversity, social cohesion and modern prejudice had relatively very little impact on the quality of life of our sample of respondents.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Zumbo, BD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Criminal victimization and the quality of life</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>245-295</pages><volume>50</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>CRIME</keyword><keyword>EXPLAINING FEAR</keyword><keyword>PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS</keyword><keyword>WORLDS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1006930019814</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this investigation was to explain the impact of crime-related issues on satisfaction with the quality of life, satisfaction with life as a whole and happiness in the city of Prince George, British Columbia. As explanatory variables, we had measures of respondent fears of and actual cases of victimization, Indexes of Neighbourhood Problems, Police Performance, Neighbourhood Worries, Defensive Behaviour, beliefs about increases in local crime, satisfaction with personal and family safety, and satisfaction with a variety of domains of life (e.g., friendships, financial security, health). Collectively such variables could explain only 5% of the variation in happiness scores, 7% of the variation in life satisfaction scores and 9% of the variation in satisfaction with the quality of life scores. However, they could explain 38% of the variation in overall neighbourhood satisfaction scores. When measures of satisfaction with family life, health, self-esteem, etc. were added, we found that crime related issues were simply displaced by the other measures and that we could explain 31% of the variation in overall happiness scores, 58% of the variation in life satisfaction scores and 59% of the variation in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores. We conclude, therefore, that crime-related issues have relatively little impact on people's satisfaction with the quality of their lives, with life satisfaction or happiness here.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Thommasen, HV</author><author>Read, R</author><author>Anderson, N</author><author>Zumbo, BD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determinants of health and the quality of life in the Bella Coola Valley</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>1-50</pages><volume>72</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>RELIABILITY</keyword><keyword>SCALING ASSUMPTIONS</keyword><keyword>SURVEY SF-36</keyword><keyword>TESTS</keyword><keyword>VALIDITY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300,1573-0921</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11205-004-4512-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this investigation is to obtain some baseline self-reported data on the health status and overall quality of life of all residents of the Bella Coola Valley of British Columbia aged 17 years or older, and to measure the impact of a set of designated health determinants on their health and quality of life. In the period from August to November 2001, a variety of procedures were used to ensure that all eligible residents of the Valley received a copy of our questionnaire, and 687 useable questionnaires were obtained for our working dataset. Health status was measured by SF-36 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control healthy days items. Thirty-one items were used to measure the Provincial Health Officer's designated determinants of health in four clusters, namely, biological, social and economic, health behaviours and health services determinants. Quality of life was measured by satisfaction levels in 13 specific domains of life (e.g., family, financial security), four global items (e.g., happiness, life satisfaction) and one global Subjective Well-Being Index. Besides obtaining baseline figures on all our measures for the Valley, we made some comparisons among our figures and those from other areas, e.g., Prince George, BC. Most of the measures indicated that the health status and quality of life of Bella Coola Valley residents were lower than those of Prince George residents. For the sample as a whole, SF-36 scores on the eight dimensions ran from 82.3 (physical functioning) to 50.0 (social functioning), with a mean of 62.7. Residents in the Valley averaged 6.5 days in the past 30 in which their health was physically not good, 5.5 days when it was mentally not good and 4.1 days when their health limited their usual daily activities. Eleven percent of respondents described their general health as "excellent" and another 27% said it was,'very good". On a 7-point scale from 1 = very dissatisfied to 7 = very satisfied, respondents had average life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores of 5.5. For specific domains of life, the lowest mean level of satisfaction was reported for federal and provincial government officials (3.3) and the highest was reported for living partners and personal safety around home (5.8). Regarding bivariate relations, each of the eight dimensions of SF-36 was significantly correlated with a single item measure of general health, and five of the eight were significantly correlated with the number of good health days. Happiness and the Subjective Well-Being Index were positively but moderately correlated with six of the eight dimensions, and life satisfaction was positively correlated with five. Age was negatively related to general health, but positively related to life satisfaction. Not being of aboriginal descent was positively related to all of the four global health indicators and to the Subjective Well-Being Index. Education was positively related to the four global health measures but not to the three global quality of life measures. The Social Support and Good Family Indexes were positively related to all seven global measures. There was a positive correlation between six of the seven global measures and the frequency with which respondents participated in activities sponsored by voluntary organizations. Frequency of smoking was negatively associated with every global dependent variable except the Physical Health Index. Frequency of skipping meals was negatively associated and average hours of sleep per night was positively associated with all seven global measures. Trning to multivariate relationships, the four clusters of health determinants explained from 12% (SF-36 Mental Health Index) to 24% (general health) of the variance in the dependent global health variables, and from 20% (happiness) to 26% (Subjective Well-Being Index) of the variance in the dependent global quality of life variables. Adding domain satisfaction scores to the total set of predictors allowed us to explain from 20% (SF-36 Mental health Index) to 29% (general health) of the variance in the dependent global health variables, and from 39% (happiness) to 62% (life satisfaction) in the dependent global quality of life variables. By including measures of social support and good family relationships in our set of health determinants, we practically guaranteed that the latter would be relatively strongly predictive of global quality of life.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Orlando, JA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quality of life of some under-represented survey respondents: Youth, Aboriginals and unemployed</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>191-213</pages><volume>79</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>PEOPLE</keyword><keyword>HAPPINESS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300,1573-0921</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11205-005-4717-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Examining an aggregated sample (N = 8800) of residents who responded to one of 16 surveys undertaken in Prince George, British Columbia in the period from November 1997 to February 2005, it was found that satisfaction with the quality of life of unemployed residents is lower than that of residents with Aboriginal backgrounds and that satisfaction with the quality of life of the latter is still lower than that of young people. Nevertheless, satisfaction with the quality of life of young people was significantly lower than that of the total sampled population, as well as that of the selected mid-life and retirement groups. Regarding predictors of our three global dependent variables (satisfaction with life as a whole and with the overall quality of life, and happiness) for the three groups (unemployed, Aboriginals and youth) and the total population, we found that the Aboriginal group was most different from all others. Satisfaction with one's own self-esteem was the most influential predictor of each global indicator for every group except Aboriginal residents. For the latter, self-esteem satisfaction was only the strongest predictor of satisfaction with the overall quality of life. The strongest predictor of life satisfaction for the Aboriginal group was satisfaction with friendships, and there were two domain satisfaction scores tied (friendships and living partner) for most influential predictors of happiness.

Seven hundred and eight British Columbians responded to a mailed out questionnaire, and the working data set was weighted by age and education to match the 2006 census statistics for the province, yielding a fairly representative sample. Speaking quite generally, about 62.0% of the results for the two samples are very similar. In particular, in both surveys we found that (a) among arts-related activities in which people participate relatively infrequently (i.e., participation is counted in times per year rather than in hours per week), live theatre is supreme in the strength of its positive correlation with respondents' perceived quality of life measured in 7 different ways, and (b) compared to 4 demographic variables (age, education, household income and body mass index), household income had the highest average, positive correlation with 7 different measures of respondents' overall life assessments, namely, self-assessed general health, satisfaction with life as a whole (single item), happiness, satisfaction with the quality of life, satisfaction with life as a whole (5-item index), contentment with life (5-item index) and subjective wellbeing (4-item index). Different results were found in the province-wide versus the five-communities survey for the following, among other things, (a) compared to all 7 life assessment measures, for the province, satisfaction with the quality of life and happiness had the largest number of significant correlations with arts-related activities measured in hours per week engaged, while for the five communities, the single measure of satisfaction with the quality of life had the largest number of significant correlations, and (b) For the province, compared to all 7 life assessment measures, satisfaction with the quality of life had the largest number of significant correlations with arts-related activities measured in times per year engaged; for the five communities, compared to all 7 life assessment measures, self-assessed general health had the largest number of significant correlations with arts-related activities measured in times per year engaged.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author><author>Hubley, AM</author><author>Zumbo, BD</author><author>Hemingway, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Health and other aspects of the quality of life of older people</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>239-274</pages><volume>54</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>OF-LIFE</keyword><keyword>SURVEY SF-36</keyword><keyword>TESTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1011045307643</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Celebrating the United Nations' International Year of Older Persons, in September 1999 a survey research project was undertaken throughout the Northern Interior Health Region (NIHR) of British Columbia. A total of 875 people completed 23-page questionnaires, the average age of the respondents was 69 and the range ran from 55 to 95 years. Responses to the SF-36 questionnaire indicated that for male respondents aged 55-64, the mean score for the 8 dimensions was 74.4. This mean was practically identical to that of the United States norm for such people (74.5) and lower than that for the United Kingdom (77.4). For male respondents aged 65 and older, the mean was 68.3. This was numerically higher but again practically the same as that of the norm for the United States (68.1). For females aged 55-64, the mean score for 8 dimensions was 73. This was superior to that of the United States norm of (70.6) for such people and lower than that for the United Kingdom (74.6). For female respondents aged 65 and older, the mean score was 65.4. This was practically identical to that of the United States (65.5). Comparing 18 average figures for our respondents on satisfaction with specific domains of life (e.g., financial security, health, friendships) and life as a whole with those of average adults in Prince George in November 1999, we found that in all but two cases the older people's scores were higher. Only in the cases of satisfaction with health and overall happiness were older people's scores lower, and the differences were not statistically significant. Eleven percent of our respondents reported that they had been a victim of a crime in the last year, compared to 38% in our 1997 adult victimization survey. Older people had a more benign view than ordinary adults of the growth of crime in their neighbourhood and city, although exactly 64% of both groups thought that crime had increased in Canada. Although older people had a more optimistic view than other adults of the increase in crime in their neighbourhoods, fewer of the former than the latter felt safe out at night. Nevertheless, compared to adults surveyed in 1997, the behaviour of respondents in our survey of older people was not as constrained by concerns of criminal victimization. Two or three of the 8 SF-36 health dimensions explained 37% of the variation in life satisfaction scores, 34% of variation in happiness scores, 34% in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores and 22% in satisfaction with one's overall standard of living. In every case, Mental Health was the dimension that had the greatest impact on our four dependent variables. When all of our potential predictors were entered into a regression equation simultaneously, we found that they could explain 60% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, 44% in happiness scores, 58% in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores and 59% in satisfaction with one's overall standard of living scores.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Policing services and the quality of life</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>61</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>OF-LIFE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1021259917948</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper results are reported of a random sample survey of 698 residents of Prince George, British Columbia taken in May 2001. The main aim of the survey was to measure respondents' assessments of local police services in Prince George, and their relative impact on the quality of respondents' lives. Generally speaking, the evaluations were quite favourable. For example, in response to the question 'what kind of a job do you think the RCMP are doing', 30% said a 'very good job' and 38% said a 'fairly good job', compared to 2% who said they were doing a 'very poor job' and 4% more a 'fairly poor job'. Compared to a 1997 survey, fewer people thought that crime had increased in the past few years, which is actually consistent with official crime statistics. The biggest perceived problem was with speeding and careless driving, although respondents rated traffic and highway enforcement as the least important of a dozen kinds of police activities. People most appreciated police work aimed at preventing crimes. Of the things people did to protect themselves from becoming a victim, keeping items in their cars out of sight headed the list. As in previous surveys in this community, highest levels of satisfaction were expressed for living partners and family relations generally. Estimating the relative impact of three police/crime related variables ( satisfaction with feelings of personal safety around one's home and in one's community, and with local policing services) on the quality of life measured in five different ways in the context of 12 other variables, it was found that only the last variable ( satisfaction with policing services) had a statistically significant association to the quality of life measured in three of the five ways. Forty percent of the variation in happiness scores and 63% of the variation in life satisfaction scores could be explained by five and six predictors, respectively, without any significant association with satisfaction with policing services. Sixty-two percent of the variation in satisfaction with respondents' overall quality of life scores could be explained by eight predictors, with satisfaction with policing services as the third most influential predictor behind satisfaction with respondents' self-esteem and friendships. Sixty-one percent of the variation in satisfaction with respondents' standard of living scores was explained by seven predictors, with satisfaction with policing services being least influential. Finally, 76% of the variation in an index of subjective well-being ( summing the scores of the other four global indicators) was explained by nine predictors, with satisfaction with policing services being second least influential.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michalos, AC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Arts and the quality of life: An exploratory study</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL INDICATORS RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>11-59</pages><volume>71</volume><number>1-3</number><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>SATISFACTION</keyword><keyword>MUSIC</keyword><keyword>THERAPY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0303-8300,1573-0921</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11205-004-8013-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The aim of this investigation was to measure the impact of the arts broadly construed on the quality of life. A randomly drawn household sample of 315 adult residents of Prince George, British Columbia served as the working data-set. Examining zero-order correlations, among other things, it was found that playing a musical instrument a number of times per year was positively associated with general health (r = 0.37), while singing alone a number of hours per week was negatively associated with general health (r = -0.19). The strongest positive associations with life satisfaction are satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking and embroidery, needlepoint or cross-stitching, at r = 0.39 and r = 0.32, respectively. The satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking (r = 0.35) and buying works of art (r = 0.32) were the most positive influences on happiness. The strongest associations with the Index of Subjective Well-Being are the satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking (r = 0.37) and the satisfaction obtained from knitting or crocheting (r = 0.34). Examining multivariate relations, it was found that eight predictors combined to explain 59% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, with self-esteem satisfaction (beta = 0.35) and friendship satisfaction (beta = 0.27) most influential. Among the arts-related predictors in the eight, singing alone was fairly influential and negative beta = -0.18), while the satisfaction obtained from reading to others (beta = 0.08) and the Index of Arts as Self-Health Enhancers (beta = 0.11) were somewhat less influential. When the arts-related predictors were combined with a set of domain satisfaction predictors, total explanatory power was increased by only 3 percentage points. Seven predictors could explain 58% of the variance in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores. Of the arts-related predictors, only time spent going to non-art museums was significant (beta = 0.07). Arts-related predictors did not increase explanatory power at all beyond that obtained from domain satisfaction variables alone. Eight predictors explained 42% of the variance in happiness scores, with the most influential predictors including satisfaction with self-esteem (beta = 0.37) and financial security (beta = 0.21), followed by the Index Arts as Self-Developing Activities (beta = 0.18). Arts-related predictors added 3 percentage points of explanatory power to that obtained from domain satisfaction scores. Seven predictors could explain 65% of the variance in scores on the Index of Subjective Well-Being, led by self-esteem satisfaction (beta = 0.35) and financial security satisfaction (beta = 0.30). The Index of Arts as Community Builders had a modest influence (beta = 0.11), but all together, arts-related predictors increased our total explanatory power by a single percentage point. Summarizing these multivariate results, it seems fair to say that, relative to the satisfaction obtained from other domains of life, the arts had a very small impact on the quality of life (measured in four somewhat different ways) of a sample of residents of Prince George who generally cared about the arts. Even in absolute terms, arts-related activities could only explain from 5% to 11% of the variance in four plausible measures of the self-perceived quality of respondents' lives. By comparing the composition of our sample with census data from 2001, it was demonstrated that the sample was not representative of residents of our city. It would, therefore, be wrong to generalize our findings to the whole populatin of Prince George or to any larger population.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;49 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;39</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Menounos, B</author><author>Koch, J</author><author>Clague, JJ</author><author>Osborn, G</author><author>Mazzucchi, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reply to comments by Kovanen and Begkt on "Early Holocene glacier advance, southern Coast Mountains, British Columbia, Canada"</title><secondary-title>QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>QUATERNARY SCIENCE REVIEWS</full-title></periodical><pages>1527-1528</pages><volume>24</volume><number>12-13</number><issue>12-13</issue><keywords><keyword>WASHINGTON</keyword><keyword>EVENT</keyword><keyword>GLACIATION</keyword><keyword>USA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0277-3791</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.quascirev.2004.12.006</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melling, DR</author><author>Watkinson, DH</author><author>Fox, PE</author><author>Cameron, RS</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Carbonatization and propylitic alteration of fragmental basaltic rocks, Quesnel River Gold Deposit, Central British Columbia.</title><secondary-title>MINERALIUM DEPOSITA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MINERALIUM DEPOSITA</full-title></periodical><pages>S115-S124</pages><volume>25</volume><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0026-4598</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00205258</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Quesnel River gold deposit (1.2 million tonnes grading 5.22 g/t Au in three separate zones) occurs within Takla Group volcanic rocks of Upper Triassic age proximal to an alkalic stock. The deposit occurs in amphibole-augite phyric, fragmental, basaltic rocks. Alteration has produced an assemblage of epidote-chlorite-tremolite-calcite-quartz with lesser pyrite, chalcopyrite, pyrrhotite, sphalerite, marcasite, galena, arsenopyrite and gold. The West Zone comprises a tabular, conformable sulfide body underlain by bedded, variably altered fragmental basaltic rocks and overlain by siltstone and argillite. In the Main Zone, highest gold grades occur adjacent to a sharp discordant alteration front with barren, strongly carbonatized, pyritic basaltic lapilli-tuff. It is overlain by siltstone and argillite and bounded to the east and a depth by a west dipping reverse fault. To the west the auriferous, propylitically altered, rocks grade laterally into lower grade and barren basaltic rocks. Oxygen (delta-O-18 = +9 to +15) and carbon (delta-O-13 = -14 to -7) isotopic signatures of calcite from carbonate-altered and propylitically altered rocks are similar. However, sulfur isotopic values for pyrite are different, with gold-associated pyrite (delta-S-34 = -7 to -3) distinct from pyrite in carbonate altered rocks with (delta-S-34 = +8 to +13). The carbonization occurred before complete induration of the basaltic fragmental rocks, whereas propylitization and gold plus sulfide precipitation is clearly epigenetic.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;17</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehrabadi, A</author><author>Craib, KJP</author><author>Patterson, K</author><author>Adam, W</author><author>Moniruzzaman, A</author><author>Ward-Burkitt, B</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: A comparison of HIV-related vulnerabilities amongst young Aboriginal women surviving drug use and sex work in two Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DRUG POLICY</full-title></periodical><pages>159-168</pages><volume>19</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>FEMALE</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>drug use</keyword><keyword>AIDS</keyword><keyword>HCV</keyword><keyword>hepatitis C</keyword><keyword>injection</keyword><keyword>PREVENTION</keyword><keyword>sex work</keyword><keyword>women</keyword><keyword>INFECTION</keyword><keyword>ABUSE</keyword><keyword>CRACK</keyword><keyword>aboriginal</keyword><keyword>ASSOCIATION</keyword><keyword>RISK BEHAVIORS</keyword><keyword>SUBSEQUENT RISK</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0955-3959,1873-4758</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.drugpo.2007.07.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: In Canada, Aboriginal women and youth continue to be overrepresented amongst new cases of HIV, and are considered at increased risk for sex and drug-related harm. Young women involved in sex work are particularly vulnerable. The purpose of this study is to determine HIV-related vulnerabilities associated with sex work amongst young Aboriginal women in two Canadian cities. Methods: This study is based on a community-based cohort of Aboriginal young people (status and non-status First Nations, Inuit and Metis) between the ages of 14 and 30 who used injection or non-injection illegal drugs (street drugs) in the previous month. Participants lived in Vancouver, Canada, or Prince George, a remote, northern Canadian city. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 543 participants were recruited by word of mouth, posters, and street outreach. A baseline questionnaire was administered by Aboriginal interviewers, and trained nurses drew blood samples for HIV and HCV antibodies and provided pre- and post-test counselling. This study included 262 Young women who participated at baseline. Analyses were conducted to compare socio-demographics, drug use patterns, injection practices, sexual experiences, and HIV and HCV prevalence between young women who reported being involved in sex work in the last 6 months (n = 154) versus young women who did not (n = 108). Logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with recent sex work involvement. Results: Both sexual violence and drug using patterns were found to be markedly different for women having recently been involved in sex work. Multivariate analysis revealed daily injection of cocaine (AOR = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.9, 10.1 and smoking crack (AOR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.6, 5.2) in the previous 6 months, and lifetime sexual abuse (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4, 4.4) to be independently associated with sex work. Interpretation: Harm reduction and treatment programs that address historical and lifetime trauma amongst Aboriginal people and prioritize emotional and physical safety for young Aboriginal women involved in sex work are required.

The simulation study was designed to evaluate the performance of methods based on overdispersed Poisson regression models for the analysis of series of count data.  Aspects addressed include estimation of the dispersion parameter, estimation of regression coefficients and their standard errors, and the performance of model selection tests.  The effects of varying amounts of overdispersion and differing underlying variance structure on this performance were of particular interest.  This study is related to work reported by Breslow (1990) although the context is quite different.  Preliminary work led to the conclusion that estimation of the dispersion parameter should be based on Pearson's chi-square statistic rather than the Poisson deviance.  Regression coefficients are well estimated, even in the presence of substantial overdispersion and when the model for the variance function is incorrectly specified.  Despite potential greater variability, the empirical estimator of the covariance matrix is preferred because the model-based estimator is unreliable in general.  When the model for the variance function is incorrect, model-based test statistics may perform poorly, in sharp contrast to empirical test statistics, which performed very well in this study.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McMillan, WJ</author><author>Thompson, JFH</author><author>Hart, CJR</author><author>Johnston, ST</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Porphyry deposits of the Canadian cordillera</title><secondary-title>GEOSCIENCE CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GEOSCIENCE CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>125-134</pages><volume>23</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>SYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>COPPER-DEPOSITS</keyword><keyword>MAGMATISM</keyword><keyword>MOLYBDENUM</keyword><keyword>PLATE-TECTONIC MODEL</keyword><keyword>TERRANE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0315-0941</isbn><abstract>Porphyry deposits are intrusion-related, large tonnage low grade mineral deposits with metal assemblages that may include all or some of copper, molybdenum, gold and silver. The genesis of these deposits is related to the emplacement of intermediate to felsic, hypabyssal, generally porphyritic intrusions that are commonly formed at convergent plate margins. Porphyry deposits of the Canadian Cordillera occur in association with two distinctive intrusive suites: calc-alkalic and alkalic. In the Canadian Cordillera, these deposits formed during two separate time periods: Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic (early Mesozoic), and Late Cretaceous to Eocene (Mesozoic-Cenozoic). Deposits of the early Mesozoic period occur in at least three different are terranes (Wrangellia, Stikinia and Quesnellia) with a single deposit occurring in the oceanic assemblage of the Cache Creek terrane. These terranes were located outboard from continental North America during formation of most of their contained early Mesozoic porphyry deposits. Some of the deposits of this early period may have been emplaced during terrane collisions. Metal assemblages in deposits of the calc-alkalic suite include Mo-Cu (Brenda), Cu-Mo (Highland Valley, Gibraltar), Cu-Mo-Au-Ag (Island Copper, Schaft Creek) and Cu-Au (Kemess, Kerr). The alkalic suite deposits are characterized by a Cu-Au assemblage (Copper Mountain, Afton-Ajax, Mt. Milligan, Mount Polley, Galore Creek). Although silver is recovered from calc-alkalic and alkalic porphyry copper mining operations, silver data are seldom included in the published reserve figures. Those available are in the range of 1-2 grams per tonne (g.t(-1)). Alkalic suite deposits are restricted to the early Mesozoic and display distinctive petrology, alteration and mineralization that suggest a similar tectonic setting for both Quesnellia and Stikinia in Early Jurassic time. The younger deposits, late Mesozoic to Cenozoic in age, formed in an intracontinental setting, after the outboard host are and related terranes accreted to the western margin of North America. These deposits are interpreted to occur in continental are settings, and individual deposits are hosted by a variety of older country rocks. These younger deposits also show a spectrum of metal associations: Cu-Mo (Huckleberry, Berg), Cu-Au (-Mo) (Bell, Granisle, Fish Lake, Casino), Mo (Endako, Boss Mountain, Kit-sault, Quartz Hill), Mo-W (Logtung), Au-W (Dublin Gulch) and Au (Ft. Knox). There may be a continuum between Mo, Mo-W, Au-Mo-W and Au deposits. The distribution and timing of these post-accretion deposits likely reflect major crustal structures and subduction geometry. Cordilleran porphyry metallic deposits show the full range of morphological and depth relationships found in porphyry deposits worldwide. In addition, the Cordillera contains numerous alkalic suite deposits, which are rare worldwide: the unusual, possibly syntectonic Gibraltar deposit; and end-member gold-rich granite-hosted deposits, such as Ft.

Samples were from four southwestern British Columbia (BC) locations, a reference site in northern BC (Fort St. James; FSJ), and from Santa Catalina Island, CA (SCI), an area of high DDT and PCB contamination. Mean concentrations of Sigma polybrominated diphenyl ether (Sigma PBDE (8 congeners monitored); 1.78-8.49 ng/g), Sigma OH-polychlorinated biphenyl (Sigma OH-PCB (30 congeners monitored); 0.44-0.87 ng/g), and Sigma OH- PBDE (14 congeners monitored; 0.31-0.92 ng/g) were similar in eaglets from southwestern BC yet lower than for SCI and significantly higher than for FSJ. Dominant PBDE congeners were BDE47, BDE99, and BDE100, but SCI eaglets also contained low levels of higher brominated congeners. 4-OH-CB187 and 4'-OH- CB202 accounted for 65-100% of Sigma OH-PCB in all BC eaglets, with 4'-OH-CB202 as well as 3'-OH-CB138 and 4-OH-CB146 dominating in SCI eaglets. Ostensibly of biogenic origin, 6'-OH-BDE49 and 6-OH-BDE47 were found in BC nestlings. Only 4'-OH-BDE49 (2.10 ng/g) was found in SCI eaglets. MeO-PBDEs and total hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were not found in any birds, but the polybrominated biphenyl BB101 was detected in southwestern BC samples. This study demonstrates that west coast North American bald eagles contain previously unreported organohalogens, which have the potential to impact the health and survival of these raptors.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;84 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;90 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McKillop, RJ</author><author>Clague, JJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Statistical, remote sensing-based approach for estimating the probability of catastrophic drainage from moraine-dammed lakes in Southwestern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GLOBAL AND PLANETARY CHANGE</full-title></periodical><pages>153-171</pages><volume>56</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>COAST MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>FAILURE</keyword><keyword>GLACIAL LAKE</keyword><keyword>hazard</keyword><keyword>HAZARDS</keyword><keyword>HIMALAYA</keyword><keyword>LOGISTIC-REGRESSION</keyword><keyword>moraine-dammed lake</keyword><keyword>NEPAL</keyword><keyword>outburst flood</keyword><keyword>OUTBURST FLOODS</keyword><keyword>RIVER BASIN</keyword><keyword>statistical analysis</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0921-8181,1872-6364</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gloplacha.2006.07.004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Safe development of glacierized regions requires a systematic and objective method for assessing the hazard posed by moraine-dammed lakes. Empirical relations exist for estimating outburst flood magnitude, but, until now, no standardized procedures have been developed for estimating outburst flood probability. To make quick and inexpensive preliminary assessments that are reproducible, we propose using a statistical, remote sensing-based approach to estimate the probability of catastrophic drainage of moraine-dammed lakes. We completed a comprehensive inventory of 175 moraine-dammed lakes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. By applying logistic regression analysis to the data set, we identified and weighted the following four independent predictor variables that best discriminate drained lakes from undrained lakes: moraine height-to-width ratio, presence/absence of an ice-core in the moraine, lake area, and main rock type forming the moraine. With an appropriate classification cutoff value, the predictive model correctly classifies 70% of drained lakes and 90% of undrained lakes, for an overall accuracy of 88%. Our model provides engineers and geoscientists with a tool for making first-order estimates of the probability of catastrophic drainage from moraine-dammed lakes in southwestern British Columbia.

Drawing on the lineages of Indigenous and feminist community-based research methodologies, we develop a three-part conception of remixed methodologies. We emphasize, first, the need to resituate the process of knowledge production within relationships between researchers and Indigenous community members. Second, we stress the importance of reconsidering the intended outputs of community-university collaboration to centre community goals. Third, we underscore how remixed methodologies can disrupt the narratives surrounding settler colonial archival resources, resituating historical footage with relation to contemporary Indigenous contexts. We apply this framework to our collaborative work with the Witsuwit'en Cultural and Language Authority and the Office of Aboriginal Education at British Columbia School District #54, combining archival and contemporary films to create Indigenous education resources. Specifically, we remixed footage of Witsuwit'en traditional activities from two 1927 National Museum of Canada films with contemporary interviews and footage of Witsuwit'en governance and land use activities. We highlight how making archival films relevant to contemporary Indigenous community goals required disrupting the conventions of scholarly authority, designing collaborative outputs to suit community aims, and resituating knowledge production within the context of Witsuwit'en resilience in the face of colonialism.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;77</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McCreary, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Between the commodity and the gift: the Coastal GasLink pipeline and the contested temporalities of Canadian and Witsuwit'en law</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND THE ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>122-145</pages><volume>11</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>settler colonialism</keyword><keyword>Wet'suwet'en</keyword><keyword>COLONIALISM</keyword><keyword>environmental governance</keyword><keyword>Indigenous law</keyword><keyword>legal geography</keyword><keyword>legal subjectivity</keyword><keyword>pipelines</keyword><keyword>temporality</keyword><keyword>Witsuwit'en</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1759-7188,1759-7196</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4337/jhre.2020.03.06</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This article examines the conflicting subjectivities and space-times of Indigenous and colonial law that underpin the recent shutdown of the Canadian economy as people barricaded railways and ports in solidarity with the Witsuwit'en hereditary chiefs' blockade against the Coastal GasLink pipeline across their territory. The article argues that this conflict between Canadian and Witsuwit'en law reflects fundamental tensions between their respective foundations in relations of the commodity and the gift. Within settler capitalist society, the value of a commodity is constructed relationally through a political economy of exchange that aims to speed transactions to maximize profits. With an ongoing drive for time-space compression, there is continual pressure in settler capitalism to develop new infrastructure that can speed the circulation of commodities. In Witsuwit'en society, the gift presents a contrasting logic of place-time extension. Rather than focusing on closing transactions to increase profits, gift giving stretches reciprocal obligations into the past and future. Contrasting these distinct conceptions of the relationship between value and time, the article argues that the Witsuwit'en struggle with Coastal GasLink should be understood as conflict between colonial temporal enclosures and a radical promise to open futures different to those engendered by the colonial present.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;71</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McClintock, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Shared Histories: Witsuwit'en-Settler Relations in Smithers, British Columbia, 1913-1973</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOGRAPHER-GEOGRAPHE CANADIEN</full-title></periodical><pages>E14-E15</pages><volume>66</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3658,1541-0064</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/cag.12788</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McAdam, SO</author><author>Walters, CJ</author><author>Nistor, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linkages between white sturgeon recruitment and altered bed substrates in the Nechako River, Canada</title><secondary-title>TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY</full-title></periodical><pages>1448-1456</pages><volume>134</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>AGE</keyword><keyword>ACCURACY</keyword><keyword>USA</keyword><keyword>ACIPENSER-TRANSMONTANUS</keyword><keyword>CONSERVATION</keyword><keyword>FIN RAYS</keyword><keyword>FRASER-RIVER</keyword><keyword>KOOTENAI RIVER</keyword><keyword>PRECISION</keyword><keyword>SPAWNING HABITAT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-8487</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1577/T04-199.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Reconstructed recruitment was compared with the relatively limited set of anthropogenic alterations to the Nechako watercourse to identify and investigate potential causes of recruitment failure of Nechako River white sturgeon Acipenser transmontanus. Back-calculation of historic recruitment shows that recruitment was present but variable from 1946 until 1964. Subsequent to 1964 there was a rapid decline, principally in 1967, and recruitment failure has continued since that time. Flow regulation, which began in 1952 with the completion of Kenney Dam, preceded recruitment failure by 15 years and therefore flow regulation does not supply a simple unicausal explanation for recruitment failure. We propose that sediment input from an upstream channel avulsion in 1961, in combination with elevated flows in 1964 and 1967, led to alterations to riverbed substrates in critical white sturgeon habitat. Using air photos and specific gauge analysis, we identified a "sediment wave" in the upper Nechako River. The timing and location of avulsion sediments indicates that recruitment failure is most likely due to alteration of main channel substrates rather than the loss of off-channel habitat. Findings are discussed with reference to general hypotheses for recruitment failure in other white sturgeon populations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Generic">13</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matthews, Carling</author><author>Picketts, Ian</author><author>Déry, Stephen</author><author>Parkes, Margot</author><author>Sharma, Aseem</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate Change &amp; Resource Development Scenarios for the Nechako Watershed: Workshop Report May 2015</title><short-title>Climate Change &amp; Resource Development Scenarios for the Nechako Watershed</short-title></titles><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of Northern British Columbia</publisher><remote-database-name>Google Scholar</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Margot_Parkes/publication/277666476_Climate_Change__Resource_Development_Scenarios_for_the_Nechako_Watershed_Workshop_Report_May_2015/links/556fa07808aefcb861dda978.pdf</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-09-13 07:14:01</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mate, DJ</author><author>Levson, VM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quaternary stratigraphy and history of the Ootsa Lake - Cheslatta River area, Nechako Plateau, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>751-765</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CORDILLERAN ICE-SHEET</keyword><keyword>ADVANCE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-112</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Erosion along the Nechako Reservoir and Cheslatta River Spillway has resulted in unusually well-exposed late Quaternary and Holocene stratigraphy. Surficial sediments in the study area are mostly products of Late Wisconsinan glaciation. However, evidence for pre-Late Wisconsinan sedimentation has been found along the shores of the Nechako Reservoir, including till of an older glaciation and organic-bearing, blue-grey, lacustrine sediments of probable Middle Wisconsinan age. Stratigraphic correlation of the lake sediments suggests that an extensive lake system occurred in the region during the Olympia Nonglacial Interval. Late Wisconsinan ice initially moved along major valleys, with glaciofluvial outwash deposited in front of the advancing ice. Advance-phase glaciolacustrine sediments are rare but significant, as slope failures are spatially associated with areas where they are preserved. The distribution of these sediments and associated deltaic deposits indicates that advance-phase glacial lakes occurred up to approximately 855 m asl, at least several metres above the modern reservoir level. Sediments deposited in front of the ice margin were overridden during ice advance and are best preserved in large valleys. At the glacial maximum, ice flowed northeasterly throughout the study region. Crag and tails, flutings, and drumlinoid ridges with a generally consistent northeast trend are the dominant landforms. Till is the most common Pleistocene surficial sediment, covering approximately 80% of the area; large areas of exposed bedrock are rare. Late-glacial glaciofluvial and Holocene fluvial deposits are uncommon and occur mainly along the Cheslatta River valley.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martins, EG</author><author>Hinch, SG</author><author>Patterson, DA</author><author>Hague, MJ</author><author>Cooke, SJ</author><author>Miller, KM</author><author>Lapointe, MF</author><author>English, KK</author><author>Farrell, AP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of river temperature and climate warming on stock-specific survival of adult migrating Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)</title><secondary-title>GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>99-114</pages><volume>17</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>POPULATIONS</keyword><keyword>BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>capture-mark-recapture</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>DEPENDENT BIOGEOGRAPHY</keyword><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>large-scale telemetry</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>ocean and river capture</keyword><keyword>OXYGEN LIMITATION</keyword><keyword>Pacific salmon</keyword><keyword>PHYSIOLOGICAL CONDITION</keyword><keyword>stochastic simulations</keyword><keyword>SWIMMING PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>THERMAL TOLERANCE</keyword><keyword>upriver migration</keyword><keyword>WATER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1354-1013,1365-2486</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02241.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mean summer water temperatures in the Fraser River (British Columbia, Canada) have increased by similar to 1.5 degrees C since the 1950s. In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture-recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival-temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961-1990) and future (2010-2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9-16% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;114 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;127 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;84</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marshall, David</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Watershed management in British Columbia: the Fraser Basin experience</title><secondary-title>Environments</secondary-title><short-title>Watershed management in British Columbia</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environments</full-title></periodical><pages>1-13</pages><volume>25</volume><number>2/3</number><issue>2/3</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Environmental Studies</keyword><keyword>watersheds</keyword><keyword>Environmental policy</keyword><keyword>Housing And Urban Planning</keyword><keyword>Planning &amp; development</keyword><keyword>Water resources</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>07116780</isbn><abstract>One of the board's key deliverables in its five-year mandate was a strategic plan for sustainability of the Fraser Basin. This plan, named the Charter for Sustainability of the Fraser Basin, was published on 27 February 1997 (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). The Charter is a prescription developed by, and for, the people who live, work, and play in the Fraser Basin. The Charter was developed based on the work of government and nongovernment agencies, committees, and individuals working together throughout the Fraser Basin. Here are some of the key elements of the Charter. The operational arm of the Fraser Basin Council Society is its Council. The Council is the custodian of the basin Charter for Sustainability (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). The Council is unique. Normally, organizations are constructed on adversarial lines. However, the Fraser Basin Council is not, and represents a new approach to doing business which cuts across adversarial lines and other differences in an effort to promote the common social good. It is a nongovernmental organization informed by governments. Governments are part of the council's management structure but it is "arm's length" from governments. It is a not-for-profit, fee-for-service, entity that can, for the first time, legally meld public sector funding with private sector participation. Although the Council is presently funded through equal contributions from the federal, provincial, and local governments, it is empowered to raise funds in many forms: bequests, legacies, property, or other in-kind gifts to augment Council operations. The Fraser Basin Charter for Sustainability is one of the final documents developed by the Fraser Basin Management Board (Fraser Basin Council, 1997). It is a broadly worded document which lays out a vision, principles, goals, and broad strategies for achieving sustainability of the Fraser Basin. Individuals, businesses, community and environmental groups, and governments are invited to promote the Charter and work together to support its implementation. The Fraser Basin Council will be responsible for updating the Charter and encouraging the application of its values and principles.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/cbcacurrent/docview/207673377/abstract/64809FD44D6649FDPQ/332?</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-10 21:40:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Markham, R</author><author>Hunt, M</author><author>Huebert, S</author><author>Graham, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Co-planning for collaborative rural and First Nations health care system transformation: Developing a pattern for partnership and social accountability</title><secondary-title>BRITISH COLUMBIA MEDICAL JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BRITISH COLUMBIA MEDICAL JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>416-421</pages><volume>63</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0007-0556</isbn><abstract>Health care system partners in BC are shifting toward delivering primary care approaches that are socially accountable and reflect the needs of all health partners. A partnership development and strategies workshop that was held on the Gidimt'en territory of the Wet'suwet'en First Nation was designed to support health care system transformation in Northern BC. Indigenous female health leaders led the workshop planning processes and facilitation to ensure that gender and racial power imbalances were addressed and the planning work was grounded in appreciation and respect for Indigenous ways of knowing and being. Workshop participants included partners from Northern Health, the First Nations Health Authority, northern divisions of family practice, medical staff associations, the Ministry of Health, academia, First Nations communities, and the community at large.Together, they used the"breathing and weaving" approach, an adaptation of the appreciative inquiry method, to discuss health care priorities. The outcomes of the workshop included the development of relationships among participants that were built on trust, mutual understanding, and respect; an increased appreciation of participatory, decolonized workshop design that included traditional healing; and a commitment to ongoing collaboration and health care system transformation to improve health and wellness service access and outcomes.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Margold, M</author><author>Jansson, KN</author><author>Kleman, J</author><author>Stroeven, AP</author><author>Clague, JJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Retreat pattern of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet in central British Columbia at the end of the last glaciation reconstructed from glacial meltwater landforms</title><secondary-title>BOREAS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BOREAS</full-title></periodical><pages>830-847</pages><volume>42</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>COAST MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>BURROUGHS-GLACIER</keyword><keyword>DEGLACIATION</keyword><keyword>HISTORY</keyword><keyword>LAKE</keyword><keyword>LAURENTIDE</keyword><keyword>PLEISTOCENE</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN</keyword><keyword>STRATIGRAPHY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0300-9483,1502-3885</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/bor.12007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Cordilleran Ice Sheet (CIS) covered much of the mountainous northwestern part of North America at least several times during the Pleistocene. The pattern and timing of its growth and decay are, however, poorly understood. Here, we present a reconstruction of the pattern of ice-sheet retreat in central British Columbia at the end of the last glaciation based on a palaeoglaciological interpretation of ice-marginal meltwater channels, eskers and deltas mapped from satellite imagery and digital elevation models. A consistent spatial pattern of high-elevation (1600-2400m a.s.l.), ice-marginal meltwater channels is evident across central British Columbia. These landforms indicate the presence of ice domes over the Skeena Mountains and the central Coast Mountains early during deglaciation. Ice sourced in the Coast Mountains remained dominant over the southern and east-central parts of the Interior Plateau during deglaciation. Our reconstruction shows a successive westward retreat of the ice margin from the western foot of the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the formation and rapid evolution of a glacial lake in the upper Fraser River basin. The final stage of deglaciation is characterized by the frontal retreat of ice lobes through the valleys of the Skeena and Omineca Mountains and by the formation of large esker systems in the most prominent topographic lows of the Interior Plateau. We conclude that the CIS underwent a large-scale reconfiguration early during deglaciation and was subsequently diminished by thinning and complex frontal retreat towards the Coast Mountains.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;105</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marcil, GK</author><author>Trudel, M</author><author>Leconte, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using Remotely Sensed MODIS Snow Product for the Management of Reservoirs in a Mountainous Canadian Watershed</title><secondary-title>WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>2735-2747</pages><volume>30</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>COVER PRODUCTS</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW</keyword><keyword>DEPLETION</keyword><keyword>Empirical relationships</keyword><keyword>Flood monitoring</keyword><keyword>MODIS snow product</keyword><keyword>Mountainous watershed</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0920-4741,1573-1650</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11269-016-1319-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The objective of this study is to analyze relationships between the variability of MODIS derived snow covered area (SCA) and flood dynamics for the management of reservoirs. The study was conducted in the Nechako River Basin in British Columbia (Canada). Relationships were analyzed between daily SCA calculated from filtered MODIS images and the fraction of the flood volume that had already entered the reservoir during the snowmelt period. Results indicate a robust (R-2 = 0.87) and significant (p &lt; 0.001) correlation over a 14-years (2000-2013) period. A similar analysis was conducted for each sub-basin, producing an even more robust relationship (R-2 = 0.90) for the Tahtsa Lake sub-basin. Two distinct relationships corresponding to years with either large or small spring runoff were identified by classifying years according to their maximum snow water equivalents (SWE), peak inflows and flood volume, thus improving the correlations. These empirical relationships are a simple forecasting tool that does not require any additional data other than MODIS SCA and SWE measurements. This straightforward approach can be applied to other mountainous watersheds dominated by snow accumulation and melt.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manning, J</author><author>Pammett, RT</author><author>Hamour, A</author><author>Enemark, A</author><author>Barr, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing Use of a Standardized Allergy History Questionnaire for Patients with Reported Allergy to Penicillin</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF HOSPITAL PHARMACY</full-title></periodical><pages>104-109</pages><volume>74</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4123</isbn><abstract>Background: Inappropriate allergy labelling is associated with significant clinical and pharmacoeconomic implications. Detailed antimicrobial allergy assessments represent a key component of antimicrobial stewardship and aid in identifying true type I (immediate hypersensitivity) reactions. The allergy history form currently used at the University Hospital of Northern British Columbia (UHNBC), in Prince George, relies on the assessor's ability to ask appropriate prompting questions to obtain a thorough history, but it may not be sufficient to accurately identify true allergies. Objective: To compare a standardized allergy history questionnaire and the current allergy history form in terms of the quality and quantity of documentation gathered. Methods: This prospective observational study involved patients who were admitted to medical and surgical services at UHNBC from November 2018 to January 2019 with a penicillin-class allergy reported on their electronic medical record (EMR). A list of patients with EMR-reported allergies was generated by the hospital's health information software system, and these patients were interviewed using the standardized allergy history questionnaire. Results: A total of 48 patients were assessed during the study period. Nineteen (40%) of the patients had an inappropriate allergy label on their EMR. Only 36 (75%) had an allergic reaction described on their EMR. Furthermore, only 36 (75%) of the 48 patients had the same allergy recorded on the EMR and on the allergy history form contained in their paper chart, of whom 22 had a documented reaction. The mean time to complete the standardized allergy history questionnaire was 2 minutes. Conclusions: At the study institution, documentation of allergy histories was often incomplete. Detailed allergy assessments are the first step in identifying true immunoglobulin E-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. Utilization of a standardized allergy history questionnaire is feasible and may serve to improve documentation and overall antimicrobial stewardship.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Makarevitch, RA</author><author>Koustov, AV</author><author>Sofko, GJ</author><author>Andre, D</author><author>Ogawa, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multifrequency measurements of HF Doppler velocity in the auroral E region</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS</full-title></periodical><volume>107</volume><number>A8</number><issue>A8</issue><keywords><keyword>ASPECT ANGLE DEPENDENCE</keyword><keyword>COHERENT BACKSCATTER</keyword><keyword>Doppler velocity</keyword><keyword>E region plasma irregularities</keyword><keyword>ECHOES</keyword><keyword>ELECTROJET</keyword><keyword>flow angle</keyword><keyword>FREQUENCIES</keyword><keyword>HF radar backscatter</keyword><keyword>ionospheric irregularities</keyword><keyword>IONOSPHERIC IRREGULARITIES</keyword><keyword>LATITUDE E-REGION</keyword><keyword>MIDLATITUDE</keyword><keyword>RADAR OBSERVATIONS</keyword><keyword>scale dependence</keyword><keyword>SPECTRA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-9380,2169-9402</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/2001JA000268</electronic-resource-num><abstract>HF measurements in Prince George, British Columbia ( Canada), at five radar frequencies between 9.3 and 15.7 MHz are considered to study the Doppler velocity of E region coherent echoes. One event showing a regular variation of velocity with radar frequency, slant range, and azimuth of observations is analyzed in detail. For this event, plasma drifts were in access of 700m s(-1), but the observed velocities were below 250 m s(-1) since measurements were performed at large flow angles ( L shell angles 45degrees&lt;phi&lt;100degrees). We show that measured Doppler velocity depends on irregularity scale but only within the Farley-Buneman (F-B) instability cone (45degrees&lt;phi&lt;75degrees). We demonstrate that maximum velocities measured at the highest radar frequency are similar to1.3 times larger than those at the lowest frequency. We also show that for observations inside the instability cone, the velocity magnitude strongly decreases with aspect angle and the rate of the decrease is scale sensitive. The effect can be described by the fluid theory formula if the nominal electron collision frequencies are replaced by anomalous collision frequencies that are similar to5 times larger. However, for observations outside the F-B instability cone (75degrees&lt;phi&lt;100degrees), the Doppler velocity does not show significant variation with aspect angle. For these directions, velocity change with flow angle was insignificant, very similar at all radar frequencies, and not consistent with the expected "cosine'' law. The implications of the measurements on the theory of electrojet instabilities and the processes of coherent echo formation are discussed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Majorowicz, J</author><author>Osadetz, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cordilleran Intermontane thermotectonic history and implications for neotectonic structure and petroleum systems, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>269-287</pages><volume>97</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>TECTONICS</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN</keyword><keyword>SKEENA FOLD BELT</keyword><keyword>Canadian Cordillera</keyword><keyword>CRUSTAL STRUCTURES</keyword><keyword>GENERATION</keyword><keyword>heat flow</keyword><keyword>intermontane</keyword><keyword>petroleum systems</keyword><keyword>sedimentary basins</keyword><keyword>SURFACE HEAT-FLOW</keyword><keyword>TEMPERATURES</keyword><keyword>VITRINITE REFLECTANCE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1437-3254,1437-3262</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00531-007-0215-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Heat flow increases northward along Intermontane Belt in the western Canadian Cordillera, as shown by geothermal differences between Bowser and Nechako sedimentary basins, where geothermal gradients and heat flows are similar to 30 mK/m and similar to 90 mW/m(2) compared to similar to 32 mK/m and 70 -80 mW/m(2), respectively. Sparse temperature profile data from these two sedimenatary basins are consistent with an isostatic model of elevation and crustal parameters, which indicate that Bowser basin heat flow should be similar to 20 mW/m(2) greater than Nechako basin heat flow. Paleothermometric indicators record a significant northward increasing Eocene or older erosional denudation, up to similar to 7 km. None of the heat generation, tectonic reorganization at the plate margin, or erosional denudation produce thermal effects of the type or magnitude that explain the north-south heat flow differences between Nechako and Bowser basins. The more southerly Nechako basin, where heat flow is lower, has lower mean elevation, is less deeply eroded, and lies opposite the active plate margin. In contrast, Bowser basin, where heat flow is higher, has higher mean elevation, is more deeply eroded, and sits opposite a transform margin that succeeded the active margin similar to 40 Ma. Differences between Bowser and Nechako basins contrast with the tectonic history and erosion impacts on thermal state. Tectonic history and eroded sedimentary thickness suggest that Bowser basin lithosphere is cooling and contracting relative to Nechako basin lithosphere. This effect has reduced Bowser basin heat flow by similar to 10-20 mW/m(2) since similar to 40 Ma. Neither can heat generation differences explain the northerly increasing Intermontane Belt heat flow. A lack of extensional structures in the Bowser basin precludes basin and range-like extension. Therefore, another, yet an unspecified mechanism perhaps associated with the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, contributes additional heat. Bowser basin's paleogeothermal gradients were higher, similar to 36 mK/m, before the Eocene and this might affect petroleum and metallogenic systems.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;89</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Magnussen, S</author><author>Harrison, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal change in wood quality attributes in standing dead beetle-killed lodgepole pine</title><secondary-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</full-title></periodical><pages>392-400</pages><volume>84</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>MODELS</keyword><keyword>bark beetle</keyword><keyword>BLUE STAIN</keyword><keyword>blue-stain</keyword><keyword>moisture content</keyword><keyword>spiral grain</keyword><keyword>wood checks</keyword><keyword>wood quality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-7546</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5558/tfc84392-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The number and size of checks, wood moisture content, extent of blue-stain, rot and decay was examined by stem analysis in 360 mature standing beetle-killed lodgepole pines. Trees came from three areas (Burns Lake, Quesnel, and Vander-hoof) in Central British Columbia. Each area was represented by 14 to 16 sampling areas (stands) distributed evenly across three soil moisture regimes (dry, mesic, wet). Year of death was estimated from tree ring-analysis, local knowledge and insect and disease survey maps. An approximately equal number of trees had been dead for one or two years, three or four years, or for five or more years. During the first five years since death by beetle attack the number of checks per tree increased from 2.5 to 10.2 and the average depth of checks increased from 4.3 cm to 5.1 cm. Checks were deeper, wider, and longer on the drier sites than on mesic and wet sites. Moisture content of sapwood and heartwood was near the fibre saturation point (ca 30%) one year after death and continued to decrease at a rate of approximately 1.7% per year. Both the incidence and the extent (relative to basal area) of rot and decay increased significantly with time since death. All trees had an extensive blue-stain discoloration. Deterioration of wood quality was fastest during the first two years after a beetle attack.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Magnus, MR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effluent flow measurement at Prince-George-Pulp-and-Paper-Limited</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>41-43</pages><volume>85</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>1984</year><pub-dates><date>1984</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacIntyre, DG</author><author>Villeneuve, ME</author><author>Schiarizza, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Timing and tectonic setting of Stikine Terrane magmatism, Babine-Takla lakes area, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>579-601</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>CACHE CREEK TERRANE</keyword><keyword>EOCENE MAGMATISM</keyword><keyword>PB ZIRCON AGES</keyword><keyword>U-PB</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-105</electronic-resource-num><abstract>New bedrock mapping completed as part of the Nechako NATMAP Project indicates that the area between Babine and Takla lakes in central British Columbia is underlain by rocks of the Early Permian Asitka, Late Triassic Takla, and Early to Middle Jurassic Hazelton volcanic-arc assemblages of the Stikine Terrane. These are cut by large composite stocks of quartz diorite, granodiorite, and quartz monzonite previously mapped as the Late Triassic to Early Jurassic Topley intrusions. New U/Pb (n = 6) and laser 40Ar/39Ar (n = 10) isotopic age dates reported in this paper suggest there are two distinct ages of plutons: the Topley intrusive suite with isotopic ages between 218 and 193 Ma; and, east of Babine Lake, the new Spike Peak intrusive suite with isotopic ages ranging from 179 to 166 Ma. West of the main plutonic belt is a thick volcanic succession of subaerial, porphyritic andesite flows, volcanic breccias, and rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs that have isotopic ages between 185 and 174 Ma. These rocks are assigned to the Saddle Hill Formation of the Hazelton Group. The plutonic roots of this proximal arc assemblage are most likely the coeval and compositionally similar plutons of the Spike Peak intrusive suite that have been unroofed in the area east of the Takla Fault. Major oxide and trace element data support the interpretation that the Topley and Spike Peak granitic rocks formed in a juvenile volcanic-arc environment and that magmatism is related to melts generated above a long-lived subduction zone of unknown orientation.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;58</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Generic">13</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacIntyre, D.

As part of the Stuart-Takla Fisheries-Forestry Interaction Project, we have investigated the influence of three variable-retention riparian harvesting prescriptions on temperatures in first-order streams in the interior sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota. However, even modest temperature changes could alter insect production, egg incubation, fish rearing, migration timing, and susceptibility to disease, and the effects of large changes to daily temperature range are not well understood.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;54 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;57 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;43</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacDonald, DD</author><author>Ikonomou, MG</author><author>Rantalaine, AL</author><author>Rogers, IH</author><author>Sutherland, D</author><author>VanOostdam, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contaminants in white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) from the upper Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY</full-title></periodical><pages>479-490</pages><volume>16</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>PCBs</keyword><keyword>2</keyword><keyword>3</keyword><keyword>7</keyword><keyword>8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-PARA-DIOXIN</keyword><keyword>BIPHENYLS</keyword><keyword>BLEACHED KRAFT PULP</keyword><keyword>DIBENZO-PARA-DIOXINS</keyword><keyword>GUPPIES</keyword><keyword>LAKE TROUT</keyword><keyword>metals</keyword><keyword>PCDDs</keyword><keyword>PCDDS</keyword><keyword>PCDFs</keyword><keyword>PCDFS</keyword><keyword>SALVELINUS-NAMAYCUSH</keyword><keyword>sturgeon</keyword><keyword>TOXIC EQUIVALENCY FACTORS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0730-7268,1552-8618</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/etc.5620160313</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Four white sturgeon were collected from the upper Fraser River near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, in the fall of 1991 and 1992. Two additional fish were taken from the Fraser River near Williams Lake, some 250 km downstream of Prince George. Samples of white muscle, red muscle, liver, and roe were analyzed for metals, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), non-ortho and mono-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and chlorophenols to determine whether the tissues of this species were acceptable for human consumption. The concentrations of mercury in the white muscle and liver of several fish from the upper Fraser River exceeded the provincial tissue residue criteria for people who consumed low quantities of fish (i.e., 210 g wet weight/week). The concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs (expressed as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents) in red muscle and liver of these fish exceeded the Health Canada working guidelines for the protection of human health. By comparison, white sturgeon collected in the lower Fraser River had much lower concentrations of metals and organic contaminants. The differences in contaminant burdens in fish from the two widely separated reaches of the river reflect their proximity to or distance from known contaminant sources.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>MacDonald, CD</author><author>Kattan, L</author><author>Layzell, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modelling electric vehicle charging network capacity and performance during short-notice evacuations</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION</full-title></periodical><volume>56</volume><keywords><keyword>SIMULATION</keyword><keyword>Charging network capacity</keyword><keyword>DEMAND</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicle charging network</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicle evacuation</keyword><keyword>Electric vehicles</keyword><keyword>EMERGENCY EVACUATION</keyword><keyword>HURRICANE</keyword><keyword>INFRASTRUCTURE</keyword><keyword>Mass evacuations</keyword><keyword>METHODOLOGY</keyword><keyword>MOBILIZATION TIME</keyword><keyword>STATION</keyword><keyword>UNDERSTAND</keyword><keyword>WILDFIRE</keyword><keyword>Wildfire evacuation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2212-4209</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijdrr.2021.102093</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Electric vehicles (EVs) may add new challenges during mass evacuations. Understanding the magnitude of the impacts EVs may have during the pre-departure stage of mass evacuations is an essential first step when planning for mass evacuations in a future where EVs are more common. In this paper, a generalized framework based on a G/G/c/N queueing model (general arrival process, general service process, c charging stations, and N EVs) was developed to estimate the number of vehicles that can be charged in the pre-departure evacuation stage and thus assess the pre-departure impacts. The model outputs are the number of vehicles that have or have not been served during the evacuation period, as well as average queue times and maximum queue lengths. This model is tested using the current electric vehicle fleet and charging infrastructure of Prince George, British Columbia, as a case study with a hypothetical short notice forest fire scenario. It was found that for the present-day case of Prince George, there is not enough charging network capacity to service all vehicles before departure.

I argue that, pursuant to the collective self-determination theory of territorial rights, the legitimate representatives of the Wet'suwet'en people must reflect the people's shared will. After describing the traditional governance system of the Wet'suwet'en people, I argue that there is nothing in principle preventing the hereditary chiefs from reflecting the shared will of the Wet'suwet'en people (as I argue electoral democracy is not always necessary for collective self-determination). I illustrate several reasons why hereditary leaders could reflect the shared will of Wet'suwet'en people better than alternative political authorities, while demonstrating that the political authority of any Wet'suwet'en governance system depends upon the actual endorsement of Wet'suwet'en people themselves.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lowe, C</author><author>Enkin, RJ</author><author>Struik, LC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tertiary extension in the central British Columbia Intermontane Belt: magnetic and paleomagnetic evidence from the Endako region</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>657-678</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>SOUTHERN OMINECA BELT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-070</electronic-resource-num><abstract>New magnetic and paleomagnetic data for central British Columbia support and quantify the hypothesis that the area underwent significant Tertiary-age transtensional deformation. Paleomagnetically determined tilts in Eocene rocks indicate that four fault-bounded pits, which constitute the Endako molybdenum mine, were displaced on a series of normal (probably listric) faults that have separations of less than a kilometre. The interpretation also suggests there can be little vertical offset on the Denak West Fault, which separates the Denak East and Denak West pits. Regional paleomagnetic data indicate a predominance of easterly directed tilts to the east of the Casey Fault, but to the west a large variation in the orientation and magnitude of tilts is observed. Results at one site proximal to the Casey Fault indicate a component of dip-slip displacement on this dominantly dextral strike-slip fault. Mapped northeast- and northwest-trending faults commonly correspond to linear zones of steep magnetic gradient and near-surface magnetic sources. Several additional northwest- and northeast-trending lineaments are imaged in the magnetic data where no faults are mapped (particularly over massive and lithologically homogeneous phases of the Endako batholith). Euler deconvolution solutions confirm most such lineaments are also associated with shallow magnetic sources. In profile, they have either a fault or dyke character and are interpreted to be unmapped faults, some locally intruded by mafic dykes, which cut the region into a series of fault-bounded blocks.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Long, W</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Shoji, Y,Reich, A</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Advanced applications for HDPE Pipe with new PRE-RT material</title></titles><periodical><full-title>PROCEEDINGS OF THE ASME PRESSURE VESSELS AND PIPING CONFERENCE, 2017, VOL 7</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>978-0-7918-5802-8</isbn><abstract>Canfor's Prince George Pulp &amp; Paper Mill in Prince George, BC, Canada operates a bleach plant effluent system for the production of Bleached Kraft Pulp.

Landscape pattern indices can be used to quantify the spatial pattern (composition and configuration) of land cover features. Observable patterns can be linked to underlying processes affecting the generation of landscape patterns (e.g., forest harvesting). The objective of this research is to develop an approach for investigating the spatial distribution of forest pattern across a study area where forest harvesting, other anthropogenic activities, and topography, are all influencing forest pattern. We generate spatial pattern regions (SPR) that describe forest pattern with a regionalization approach. Analysis is performed using a 2006 land cover dataset covering the Prince George and Quesnel Forest Districts, 5.5 million ha of primarily forested land base situated within the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. Multivariate cluster analysis (with the CLARA algorithm) is used to group landscape objects containing forest pattern information into SPR. Of the six generated SPR, the second cluster (SPR2) is the most prevalent covering 22% of the study area. On average, landscapes in SPR2 are comprised of 55.5% forest cover, and contain the highest number of patches, and forest/non-forest joins, indicating highly fragmented landscapes. Regionalization of landscape pattern metrics provides a useful approach for examining the spatial distribution of forest pattern. Where forest patterns are associated with positive or negative environmental conditions, SPR can be used to identify similar regions for conservation or management activities.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;55</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lofroth, EC</author><author>Krebs, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The abundance and distribution of wolverines in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>2159-2169</pages><volume>71</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>SELECTION</keyword><keyword>CLASSIFICATION</keyword><keyword>INDICATOR</keyword><keyword>AMERICA</keyword><keyword>distribution</keyword><keyword>ROCKY-MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>Gulo gulo</keyword><keyword>abundance</keyword><keyword>density estimation</keyword><keyword>GULO-GULO</keyword><keyword>habitat quality</keyword><keyword>LARGE CARNIVORE CONSERVATION</keyword><keyword>mapping</keyword><keyword>POPULATION-SIZE</keyword><keyword>SCANDINAVIA</keyword><keyword>wolverines</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-541X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2193/2007-094</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The abundance and distribution of carnivores and their habitat are key information needed for status assessment, conservation planning, population management, and assessment of the effects of human development on their habitat and populations. We developed a habitat quality rating system, using existing wolverine (Gale gulo) distribution, wolverine food, ecosystem mapping, and human development data. We used this and empirically derived estimates of wolverine density to predict wolverine distribution and abundance at a provincial scale. Density estimates for wolverines in high-quality habitat averaged 6.2 wolverines/1,000 km(2) (95% CI = 4.2-9.5). We predicted mean densities ranging from 0.3/1,000 km(2) in rare-qualin, habitat to 4.1/1,000 km(2) in moderate-quality habitat. Our predicted population estimate for wolverines in British Columbia was 3,530 (95% CI - 2,700-4,760). We predicted highest densities of wolverines in interior mountainous regions, moderate densities in interior plateau and boreal forest regions, and low densities in mainland coastal regions and drier interior plateaus. We predicted that wolverines would be rare on Vancouver Island, along the outer mainland coast, and in the dry interior forests, and absent from the Queen Charlotte Islands, interior grassland environments, and areas of intensive urban development.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;79</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lockhart, WL</author><author>Macdonald, RW</author><author>Outridge, PM</author><author>Wilkinson, P</author><author>DeLaronde, JB</author><author>Rudd, JWM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tests of the fidelity of lake sediment core records of mercury deposition to known histories of mercury contamination</title><secondary-title>SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>171-180</pages><volume>260</volume><number>1-3</number><issue>1-3</issue><keywords><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>FLUXES</keyword><keyword>UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>mercury</keyword><keyword>NORTH-AMERICA</keyword><keyword>sediment</keyword><keyword>contamination</keyword><keyword>deposition</keyword><keyword>ISOTOPE RATIOS</keyword><keyword>lakes</keyword><keyword>LEAD</keyword><keyword>METALS</keyword><keyword>POLLUTION</keyword><keyword>REMOTE AREAS</keyword><keyword>TRACERS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0048-9697,1879-1026</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0048-9697(00)00561-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>There has been recent controversy over the discrimination between natural and anthropogenic loadings of mercury to lakes. Sediment core profiles have been interpreted as evidence that inputs to lakes have increased. Some investigators have argued, however, that mercury may be sufficiently mobile in sediments to generate profiles that are misinterpreted as historical records. This argument can be tested where the histories of inputs of mercury are known independently from other kinds of information. We have such cases in Canadian lakes and we have been able to assemble sediment core records for comparison with known source histories. Three cases are represented by Clay Lake in Ontario where the source was a chlor-alkali plant with a known history of mercury discharges, Giauque Lake in the Northwest Territories where mercury was used at a gold mine to extract gold from ore, and Stuart Lake in British Columbia where a mercury mine operated for a known period at Pinchi Lake, the lake immediately upstream from Stuart Lake. In these cases lake sediment cores were dated using lead-210 and cesium-137 and then slices were analysed for mercury. The histories of mercury deposition derived from the cores agreed well with the known histories of inputs.

While it is very important to burn less fossil fuel and to employ alternative energy sources, other carbon-reduction options must also be considered. Given that forests comprise a large portion of the global landbase and that they play a very significant role in the global carbon cycle, it is logical to examine how forest management practices could effect reductions in carbon emissions. Many papers that discuss forest carbon sinks or sources refer only to the short term (&lt;20 years). This paper focuses on the sustainable carbon storage contributions of a forest over the long term. This paper explains that long-term carbon storage and reduced carbon fluctuation can be achieved by a combination of improved forest management and efficient transfer of carbon into wood products. Here we show how three different forest management scenarios affect the overall carbon storage capacity of forest and wood products combined over the long term. We used a timber supply model and scenario analysis to predict forest carbon and other resource conditions over time in the Prince George Forest District, a 3.4-million-ha landbase in northern British Columbia. We found that the high-harvest scenario stores 3% more carbon than the low-harvest scenario and 27% (120 million tonnes) more carbon than the no-harvest scenario even though only 1.2-million ha is in timber harvesting landbase. Our results tell us that forest management practices that maintain and increase forest area, reduce natural disturbances in the forest, improve forest conditions, and ensure the appropriate and timely transfer of carbon into wood products lead to increasing overall carbon storage, thereby reducing carbon in the atmosphere.

Pollen data from a rare new interglacial site suggest a colder than present Middle Wisconsinan climate. Ice flow during the last glaciation was dominantly southeasterly, but in the Babine Range a regional, westerly ice-flow event occurred. Evidence for westerly flow diminishes eastward of Babine Lake, suggesting that the valley was near the eastward limit of an interior ice divide. Deglacial sediments include ice-marginal debris-flow, glaciofluvial, and glaciolacustrine sediments. Raised-delta elevations indicate that Glacial Lake Babine extended nearly 150 m above present lake level to 850 m asl, and higher, earlier phases may have existed locally. A variety of Holocene deposits cap the Quaternary succession. Glaciation has important implications for exploration in this copper-producing area. Southeasterly glacial dispersal patterns dominate, despite a regionally complex ice-flow history. Highly anomalous concentrations of copper occur in tills down-ice of most known bedrock copper occurrences, and a number of similarly anomalous till sites with no known copper sources have been identified in drift-covered areas. Exploration problems due to the thick and complex surficial cover can be overcome by selective sampling of basal tills, the composition of which clearly reflects the presence of buried mineral deposits. The effectiveness of till geochemistry as a method for locating buried mineralization in the region will be enhanced by careful selection of sample media and by a clear understanding of the glacial history.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Levson, Victor M.</author><author>Mate, David</author><author>Stuart, Andrew J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quaternary Geology and Drift prospecting studies in the North Central Nechako Plateau (93 F and K)</title><secondary-title>British Columbia Geological Survey Geological Fieldwork 1998</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>British Columbia Geological Survey Geological Fieldwork 1998</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>This paper provides an overview of Quaternary geology and drift prospecting stud- ies conducted in the Nechako River and Fort Fraser 1:250 000 map areas (NTS 93 F and K, respectively) by the British Columbia Geological Survey in 1998.

Almost the entire mainstem was therefore probably winter habitat, and major tributaries such as the Thompson, Quesnel, and Nechako rivers were also used. Estimated chinook density on the mainstem Fraser increased with distance upstream (maximum 0.30 m-2 at km 750 (Prince George)), but the highest density (0.99 m-2) in the surveys was observed on the Thompson River at Spences Bridge. The mean size of juvenile chinook decreased with distance upstream on the Fraser, ranging from 97 mm at km 110 to 65 mm at km 770. Chinook juveniles were feeding on Diptera, Trichoptera, and Plecoptera in winter.

They are lithologically similar to the informally named Upper Cretaceous Kasalka Group rocks exposed in the type area at Tahtsa Lake, 75 km southwest of the deposit, and at Mount Cronin, 100 km northwest of the deposit. The Kasalka Group rocks in the Tahtsa Lake area give questionable dates of 105 +/- 5 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock but are cut by intrusions dated at 83.8 +/- 2.8 Ma by K-Ar on biotite. The sequence at the Silver Queen deposit includes a polymictic conglomerate, followed upward by felsic fragmental rocks and a thick porphyritic andesite flow and sill unit, cut by microdiorite and quartz-feldspar porphyry intrusions. The porphyritic andesite and the microdiorite have been dated as Late Cretaceous (78.3 +/- 2.7 and 78.7 +/- 2.7 Ma, respectively, by K-Ar on whole rock), close to previous dates for these rocks (77.1 +/- 2.7 and 75.3 +/- 2.0 Ma, respectively). The quartz - feldspar porphyry intrudes the porphyritic andesites but has an older U-Pb zircon date of 84.6 +/- 0.2 Ma, probably due to underestimation of the true age of the host rocks by the K-Ar whole-rock method. Later dykes correlate with younger volcanic rocks belonging to the Ootsa Lake and Endako groups. Eocene pre- and postmineral plagioclase-rich dykes (51.9 +/- 1.8 to 51.3 +/- 1.8 Ma) and late diabase dykes (50.4 +/- 1.8 Ma; all by K-Ar on whole rock) may be correlative with trachyandesite volcanics of the Goosly Lake Formation, part of the Eocene Endako Group. These volcanics have been dated elsewhere at 55.6 +/- 2.5 to 48.8 +/- 1.8 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock and biotite, respectively. Mineralization at Silver Queen is therefore similar in age to, but slightly younger than, the producing Equity mine located 30 km to the northeast, which is estimated at 58.5 +/- 2.0 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>LeBlanc, Suzanne</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>You can't fix what you don't see: a case study of unprofessional behaviour in the workplace</title><short-title>You can't fix what you don't see</short-title></titles><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>unbc.arcabc.ca</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A5956/</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-24 19:56:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lawton, F.

Thus far, little is known about how these partnerships have factored into indigenous pursuits of territorial autonomy. This article describes how the Cheslatta T'en, a Dakelh (Carrier) community in north-central British Columbia, established a measure of control over their homeland after forming an alliance with local nonnative residents. Cheslatta leaders used cultural exchanges and social networks generated by the alliance to fashion territorial initiatives that, when taken together, channel popular environmentalism, provincial forestry policies, and ancestral ethnoecology into collective identity, action, and authority. As a result, the band has attained political influence over its traditional lands without participating in the province's treaty settlement process. Interethnic partnerships in rural areas are particularly relevant to political ecology because they reveal how the common experience of powerlessness can generate new forms of resource management that synthesize diverse constructions of nature. In this way, the paper contributes to the growing empirical work on such alliances and to emerging frameworks for a political ecology of social movements. It also adds to the ethnographic literature on the colonial encounter in British Columbia by highlighting the role of interethnic collaboration in contemporary rural resource management projects.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;39</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larsen, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gift of art/gift of place: boundary work for Indigenous coexistence</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY</full-title></periodical><pages>117-130</pages><volume>39</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Indigenous</keyword><keyword>place</keyword><keyword>Art</keyword><keyword>boundary work</keyword><keyword>participatory research</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0887-3631,1940-6320</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/08873631.2021.1989251</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Collaborative art is an important kind of "boundary work" in decolonizing relationships to self, others, and land in today's settler societies, or the multinational states that formed as a result of European settler colonialism. This article tells the story of a children's book co-produced by the Cheslatta Carrier Nation in British Columbia and two undergraduate students at the University of Missouri (MU) along with their faculty mentor and his son at the 2018 Cheslatta Camp Out. The Camp Out is a time when the Cheslatta Nation returns to Cheslatta Lake, the homeland from which they were forcibly evacuated in 1952. The process of doing art for the children's book together in place at the Camp Out facilitated the trust and rapport essential for the collaborative creative work, and ultimately helped the participants co-discover the storyline for the book. The co-produced artworks for the children's book (watercolors, photographs, illustrations, stories) became gifts that trace the circuits and complicities of entangled relations. As a gift, artwork brings disparate communities of practice fully into reckoning with place, understood in the Indigenous sense as the relationship of things to each other through land. This is the gift of art, the gift of place.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larabi, S</author><author>Schnorbus, MA</author><author>Zwiers, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A coupled streamflow and water temperature (VIC-RBM-CE-QUAL-W2) model for the Nechako Reservoir</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES</full-title></periodical><volume>44</volume><keywords><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>Water temperature</keyword><keyword>BIAS CORRECTION</keyword><keyword>CE-QUAL-W2</keyword><keyword>CEQUAL-W2</keyword><keyword>HEAT-FLUX</keyword><keyword>Nechako Reservoir</keyword><keyword>PARAMETERIZATION</keyword><keyword>RBM</keyword><keyword>VIC-GL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2214-5818</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejrh.2022.101237</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Study region: Nechako Reservoir, British Columbia, Canada.Study focus: Hydrological regulation affect both hydrological and thermal conditions in the reservoir and downstream reach, subsequently disrupting fish habitats. This paper aims at developing an integrated model simulating physical processes that govern the quantity and quality of inflow, reservoir, and outflow water of the Nechako Reservoir. Such a model would help stakeholders understand the response of in-reservoir water temperature stratification and downstream water temperature to changes in inflow and reservoir operation under future climate change.New hydrological insights for the region: The model was calibrated against historical reservoir levels and in-reservoir and outlet water temperature field data. The integrated model simulated accu-rately the wide variation of reservoir levels as well as the in-reservoir water temperature at Kenney Dam and the outlet temperature. Sensitivity analysis shows that reservoir water tem-perature particularly the epilimnion is sensitive to changes in both meteorological and hydro-logical forcing. Forcing the model with different outflow scenarios shows the weak sensitivity of temperature of water released to outflow rates. Given epilimnion water releases at the spillway, the Summer Temperature Management Program could be inefficient to provide cool water in the Nechako River during the critical period of salmon migration in a warming climate. However, colder water remains available at depth at Kenney Dam to potentially mitigate and better control downstream water temperature.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;74</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lapierre, H</author><author>Bosch, D</author><author>Tardy, M</author><author>Struik, LC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late Paleozoic and Triassic plume-derived magmas in the Canadian Cordillera played a key role in continental crust growth</title><secondary-title>CHEMICAL GEOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CHEMICAL GEOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>55-89</pages><volume>201</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>Canadian cordillera</keyword><keyword>geochemistry</keyword><keyword>GREENSTONE-BELT</keyword><keyword>ICP-MS</keyword><keyword>ND</keyword><keyword>oceanic crust</keyword><keyword>oceanic plateaus</keyword><keyword>OCEANIC PLATEAUS</keyword><keyword>PB</keyword><keyword>plate tectonics</keyword><keyword>SLIDE MOUNTAIN</keyword><keyword>SUPERIOR PROVINCE</keyword><keyword>TECTONIC EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>TERRANES</keyword><keyword>VOLCANIC-ROCKS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0009-2541,1872-6836</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0009-2541(03)00224-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Two major Late Paleozoic-Triassic oceanic terranes are exposed in the North America Cordillera. Slide Mountain Terrane is made up of dolerites, pillow basalts associated with cumulate gabbros and peridotites ranging in age from Carboniferous to Permian. Cache Creek Terrane consists of tectonic slices of Paleozoic platform carbonates, undated cumulate gabbros intruded by dolerites, foliated ultramafic rocks and mafic volcanic rocks interbedded within Upper Triassic siliceous and volcaniclastic sediments. Among the Permian (Slide Mountain) and Upper Triassic (Cache Creek) volcanic rocks, four types have been distinguished. Type 1 is geochemically similar to N-MORB. Type 2 is mildly to highly enriched in LREE, Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and Th, and differs from Type 1 by lower epsilonNd and higher Pb isotopic ratios. It displays alkaline affinities. Types 3 and 4 occur only in the Cache Creek Terrane. Type 3 has flat REE patterns similar to oceanic plateau basalts and isotope compositions intermediate between Types 1 and 2. Type 4 is distinguished from Type 3 by convex REE patterns and higher Pb isotopic ratios. Cumulate peridotites and gabbros are LREE-depleted and their high epsilonNd suggest that they derived from the melting of a depleted MORB-type mantle source. The foliated ultramafic rocks are either serpentinized harzburgites (Trembleur ultramafics) or dunites, harburgites and minor lherzolites (Murray Ridge), which are, intruded by undeformed pyroxenite veins. The ultramafic rocks have very low contents of rare earth elements (REE) and incompatible elements, and U-shaped REE patterns. The pyroxene-bearing peridotites are distinguished from the Trembleur harzburgites by an absence of Nb negative anomalies and lower (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios. Slide Mountain and Cache Creek Terranes formed in different tectonic settings. Slide Mountain basin, fringing the North American margin, was probably floored by oceanic crust locally thickened by oceanic island magmas. Indeed, in the Slide Mountain Terrane, N-MORB type basalts predominate and are associated with minor alkaline volcanic rocks within the same thrust sheet. Correlations between incompatible elements and values of the epsilonNd of the Slide Mountain rocks suggest that the N-MORB-type basalts and alkaline rocks are genetically linked. N-MORB type basalts and alkaline volcanic rocks could derive from the mixing of depleted MORB-type and enriched Oceanic island Basalt-type mantle sources. The Cache Creek Terrane may represent remnants of a Late Triassic oceanic plateau because plume-related volcanic rocks predominate while N-MORB type rocks are represented solely by cumulate gabbros and sheeted dykes. The Murray Ridge peridotites could represent the roots of the oceanic plateau. We conclude that the Slide Mountain and Cache Creek Terranes contributed to the growth of the North American continent as when they were accreted to the craton during the Early Triassic and Jurassic times.

This frequently sparks opposition from local Indigenous communities, even in locations where economic benefits are promised in exchange for access to land. This paper casts light on this subject through a case study of resistance among the Tsilhqot'in Indigenous people, who are protesting against the development of a multi-million dollar gold-copper mine within their traditional territory. Drawing on findings from Community-Based research and a review of documents from Tsilhqot'in court cases, this paper provides a deepened understanding about the relationship the Tsilhqot'in people have with their land. The major themes covered are as follows: (1) Aboriginal community values, which are critical to the survival of such people; and (2) the contemporary culture of the Tsilhqot'in people, including profiling how some women continue to survive on the land. The study captures the dynamics of Aboriginal values at the project location and how these are affected by resource development activities. Crown Copyright (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

After a 28-day exposure at 0.4-2.7 degreesC to secondary-treated bleached kraft mill effluent (TBKME; 0%, 2%, 4%, 8%, or 16%) under both normoxic and hypoxic (similar to67% air saturation) conditions, hematocrit (Hct), leucocrit (Lct), and differential white blood cell counts were determined and gills were examined for gross and fine morphometry. TBKME had no effect on either Hct or Lct, but the highest TBKME concentration (16%) increased lymphocyte numbers, reduced secondary lamellae numbers, and increased the blood-water diffusion distance of secondary lamellae. Given the relatively high TBKME concentration, compared with actual discharges to the river, and the small physiological changes observed, it appears that chronic winter exposure of juvenile chinook salmon to TBKME under hypoxic winter conditions is unlikely to produce major disturbances to these aspects of the fish's physiology.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Krausz, RM</author><author>Clarkson, AF</author><author>Strehlau, V</author><author>Torchalla, I</author><author>Li, K</author><author>Schuetz, CG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mental disorder, service use, and barriers to care among 500 homeless people in 3 different urban settings</title><secondary-title>SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SOCIAL PSYCHIATRY AND PSYCHIATRIC EPIDEMIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>1235-1243</pages><volume>48</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>PREVALENCE</keyword><keyword>WOMEN</keyword><keyword>CITY</keyword><keyword>DRUG</keyword><keyword>Health services</keyword><keyword>Homeless persons</keyword><keyword>INDIVIDUALS</keyword><keyword>Mental disorder</keyword><keyword>PSYCHIATRIC-DISORDERS</keyword><keyword>Substance dependence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0933-7954,1433-9285</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00127-012-0649-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To determine the standardized rates of mental disorder, health service use and barriers to care in a representatively diverse sample of homeless adults in three different sized urban centers in British Columbia, Canada. Five hundred homeless adults from Vancouver, Victoria and Prince George were recruited. The MINI-International Neuropsychiatric Interview PLUS was used to determine current and lifetime rates of mental disorder, mental disorder episodes and suicidality. Health service use and barriers to care were recorded. Overall, 92.8 % of participants met criteria for a current mental disorder: 82.6 % for alcohol or drug dependence, 57.3 % anxiety disorder, 31.5 % mood disorder. Over half (53.4 %) met criteria for a concurrent disorder. Only 14.9 % had seen a psychiatrist and 12.7 % a mental health team in the year prior to the survey. Most common barriers included being poorly connected to the system of care and issues related to homelessness. Mental disorder rates across sites were high, however, differences were found that reflected the composition of the samples. Improving the mental health state of the homeless will require significant capacity for mental health and concurrent disorder programming that is tailored to the community it intends to serve. Demographic features of the population may help in directing assessments of need.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;81 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;81 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knudson, RM</author><author>McFarling, SM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extracting greater value from subalpine fir: Veneer products</title><secondary-title>FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>17-23</pages><volume>59</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>INCISING TECHNOLOGY</keyword><keyword>PLYWOOD/LVL PRODUCTION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-7473</isbn><abstract>This paper, which described an evaluation of the suitability of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) for the manufacture of preservative-treated plywoood and laminated veneer lumber (LVL), was part of an overall study to explore opportunities to extract greater value from subalpine fir (Knudson et al. 2008, McFarling et al. 2009). Due to preferential logging of lodgepole pine, the availability of subalpine fir in British Columbia is projected to increase significantly, in some regions to as high as 30 percent of the softwood harvest. Logs for the vencer products studied came from five subalpine fir trees (one dominant, one codominant, and three intermediate) from a Canadian Forest Products Ltd. (Canfor) logging site in the Fort St. James harvest region of British Columbia. The trees were considered representative of the site type and age class expected to be harvested over the next period of years. Study results indicated that subalpine fir is a satisfactory species for manufacturing construction plywood or lower stiffness grade LVL. This study confirmed that subalpine fir plywood, made from both incised and non-incised veneer, can be preservative treated with alkaline copper quat (ACQ-D) and copper azole to meet CSA 080. 15-97 PWF standard (CSA 1997). Currently subalpine fir plywood is not used for permanent wood foundations (PWF) because it cannot be treated with copper chromated arsenate to meet the CSa standard. Other British Columbia softwood species that are usually processed with subalpine fir are classified as unsuitable for preservative treatment. This study indicates that a 100 percent subalpine fir plywood panel substrate would be suitable for PWFs when treated with amine copper preservatives.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kitts, DD</author><author>Chen, XM</author><author>Broda, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Polyaromatic Hydrocarbons of Smoked Cured Muscle foods prepared by Canadian Tl'azt'en and Llheidli T'enneh First Nation Communities.</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH-PART A-CURRENT ISSUES</full-title></periodical><pages>1249-1252</pages><volume>75</volume><number>21</number><issue>21</issue><keywords><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS</keyword><keyword>SMOKING</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1528-7394,1087-2620</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/15287394.2012.709410</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh First Nation communities have traditionally used smoking, drying, and salting of fish and game as preservation methods to enhance food security.

The total concentrations of PAH present in fully smoked meats using traditional smoke processing methods employed by Tl'azt'en and Lheidli T'enneh nations indicate that a risk assessment is required to determine the safety of these smoke-processed foods.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kim, HS</author><author>Cassidy, JF</author><author>Dosso, SE</author><author>Kao, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mapping crustal structure of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau using teleseismic receiver function analysis(1,2)</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>407-417</pages><volume>51</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>SEISMIC-REFLECTION</keyword><keyword>BENEATH</keyword><keyword>INVERSION</keyword><keyword>NETWORK</keyword><keyword>PARAMETER</keyword><keyword>STATIONS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2013-0147</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper presents results of a passive-source seismic mapping study in the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau of central British Columbia, with the ultimate goal of contributing to assessments of hydrocarbon and mineral potential of the region. For the present study, an array of nine seismic stations was deployed in 2006-2007 to sample a wide area of the Nechako-Chilcotin plateau. The specific goal was to map the thickness of the sediments and volcanic cover, and the overall crustal thickness and structural geometry beneath the study area. This study utilizes recordings of about 40 distant earthquakes from 2006 to 2008 to calculate receiver functions, and constructs S-wave velocity models for each station using the Neighbourhood Algorithm inversion. The surface sediments are found to range in thickness from about 0.8 to 2.7 km, and the underlying volcanic layer from 1.8 to 4.7 km. Both sediments and volcanic cover are thickest in the central portion of the study area. The crustal thickness ranges from 22 to 36 km, with an average crustal thickness of about 30-34 km. A consistent feature observed in this study is a low-velocity zone at the base of the crust. This study complements other recent studies in this area, including active-source seismic studies and magnetotelluric measurements, by providing site-specific images of the crustal structure down to the Moho and detailed constraints on the S-wave velocity structure.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khorsandi, M</author><author>St-Hilaire, A</author><author>Arsenault, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multisite calibration of a semi-distributed hydrologic and thermal model in a large Canadian watershed</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>2147-2174</pages><volume>67</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>hydrological model</keyword><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>VALIDATION</keyword><keyword>CATCHMENT</keyword><keyword>SWAT</keyword><keyword>calibration</keyword><keyword>CEQUEAU</keyword><keyword>multisite</keyword><keyword>PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>river temperature</keyword><keyword>SINGLE</keyword><keyword>water temperature model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0262-6667,2150-3435</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02626667.2022.2132161</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study compares single-site and multisite calibration methods with upscaled parameters for thermal modelling. Multisite calibration and parameter upscaling are novel for calibrating a hydrological-thermal model. To this end, model calibration and simulations are carried out using a semi-distributed hydrological-thermal model (CEQUEAU). First, a hydrological calibration is carried out. The same calibrated hydrological model outputs are used for all thermal calibrations. The covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) single-objective optimization algorithm is applied to calibrate the thermal module using observed water temperatures at seven monitoring sites within the Nechako Watershed in British Columbia, Canada. Single-site calibration provided the best performance for individual sites, but these sets of parameters performed poorly when applied to the other sites. The multisite calibration and the upscaled methods perform adequately for all sites with overall Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)&lt;2 degrees C as an acceptable threshold. However, the multisite method resulted in the best performance metrics and shortest computing time.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;53</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kennedy, LA</author><author>Otter, KA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Grass management regimes affect grasshopper availability and subsequently American crow activity at airports</title><secondary-title>HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HUMAN-WILDLIFE INTERACTIONS</full-title></periodical><pages>58-66</pages><volume>9</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>AIRCRAFT</keyword><keyword>BIRDS</keyword><keyword>REDUCE</keyword><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>WILDLIFE HAZARDS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1934-4392,1936-8046</isbn><abstract>With large expanses of open vegetation, airports serve as major attractants for numerous bird species, such as the American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), which can lead to high risk of bird-aircraft collision. Previous observations of large influxes of crows at the Prince George Airport (British Columbia, Canada) in July and August suggested that crows were opportunistically foraging on grasshopper (Melanoplus sp.) population eruptions in mown grass during those months. We tested whether grasshoppers were more visible (i.e., easier for crows to detect) under different grass lengths, and whether crows were preferentially attracted to these same grass lengths. Employing line transects during July to August 2010 and 2011, we detected &gt;6 times as many grasshoppers in short-cut grass (0 to 15 cm) than in uncut grass (&gt;30 cm). Data from 2011 also revealed that grasshopper detections by crows was significantly higher in short-cut grass than in grass left at intermediate lengths (long-cut grass [15 to 30 cm]). Crow densities also varied with grass length, with significantly more crows foraging in short-cut than long-cut or uncut grass lengths. Our results indicate that allowing the grass to grow to &gt;15 cm could reduce the attraction of crows to the airfield and may reduce bird-aircraft collisions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kelly, BC</author><author>Fernandez, MP</author><author>Ikonomou, MG</author><author>Knapp, W</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Persistent organic pollutants in aquafeed and Pacific salmon smolts from fish hatcheries in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>AQUACULTURE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AQUACULTURE</full-title></periodical><pages>224-233</pages><volume>285</volume><number>1-4</number><issue>1-4</issue><keywords><keyword>RAINBOW-TROUT</keyword><keyword>FRASER-RIVER</keyword><keyword>Aquafeed</keyword><keyword>AQUATIC FOOD-WEBS</keyword><keyword>Bioaccumulation</keyword><keyword>Effects</keyword><keyword>FARMED ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>INTESTINAL-ABSORPTION</keyword><keyword>KRAFT MILL EFFLUENT</keyword><keyword>ORGANOCHLORINE RESIDUES</keyword><keyword>P-DIOXINS PCDDS</keyword><keyword>PCBs</keyword><keyword>PCDD/Fs</keyword><keyword>Pesticides</keyword><keyword>POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS</keyword><keyword>Salmon smolts</keyword><keyword>TROUT ONCORHYNCHUS-MYKISS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0044-8486,1873-5622</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.08.035</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Recent studies have reported the occurrence of persistent organic pollutants (POPS) in commercial feeds used by fish hatcheries and aquaculture facilities. We measured levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzo furans (PCDFs), as well as several organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in several aquafeeds as well as fry and smolts collected from four federal salmonid hatcheries from coastal British Columbia. Sigma PCBs in aquafeed samples (n=22) averaged 270 +/- 136 ng/g lipid. Sigma EDDTs, Sigma Toxaphene, Sigma Chlordanes. Sigma Chlorobenzenes, Sigma Hexachlorocyclohexanes, dieldrin, endrin and pentachloroanisole in feeds ranged between 0.6 and 200 ng/g lipid. Sigma EPCDD/F levels in feed samples were relatively low (77 +/- 50 pg/g lipid). In some cases, contaminant levels and patterns varied between different feed brands (i.e., Moore-Clarke, EWOS and OMP). Sigma PCB concentrations (ng/g lipid) in Moore-Clarke (154.3 +/- 88.9) were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) than Sigma PCBs in OMP (319.8 +/- 101) and EWOS (376.3 +/- 88.2) feeds. which is likely due to different constituent composition in the Moore-Clarke feed. As young hatchery salmon smolts are sequentially introduced to increasingly lipid-rich starter feeds (which contain higher contaminant burdens), dietary exposure of POPS generally increases during the rearing process. However, tissue residue concentrations of POPS in smolts remained relatively low compared to feed, as denoted by the relatively low biomagnification factors of the various POPS (BMFs between 0.2 and 3). 2,3.7,8 TCCD toxic equivalent concentrations (TEQs) in smolts (0.21 +/- 0.19 pg/g wet wt.) were generally below levels associated with dioxin-like toxic effects. The highest TEQ was observed in Robertson Creek smolts (0.38 +/- 0.11 pg/g wet wt). Biochemical response measurements (EROD activity and CYPIA levels) in liver tissue of those smolts did not show any indication of negative impacts associated with aryl hydrocarbon (Ah) receptor inducers such as dioxins/furans and dioxin-like PCBs.

However, there are relatively few centers where this practice has been adopted with no reports from hemodialysis units in rural, remote, and northern locations. Maintaining mobility and quality of life for patients on kidney replacement therapy living in remote northern communities is inhibited by inclement weather and lack of access to resources and infrastructure that support physical activity. The integration of intradialytic cycling during hemodialysis offers patients a form of safe physical activity year-round. Objective: This study focuses on better understanding the feasibility and acceptability of implementing intradialytic cycling in a remote northern geographical context. Design: A feasibility study using a mixed-methods explanatory design was adopted for this study. Setting: The research is conducted in Prince George, British Columbia. Participants: The participants are patients attending a community-based dialysis unit in remote northern British Columbia and health professionals working in the same facility. Methods: Quantitative measures were captured through cycling logbooks and quality of life measure, and qualitative data were obtained through semi-structured interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Six (43%) eligible patients used leg ergometers more than once for a median of 2.5 (interquartile range: 1-4) months and 87% of hemodialysis sessions. Participants cycled for a median of 65 (interquartile range: 39-76) minutes per session, with frequent variability noted between participants and different hemodialysis sessions for the same participant. Nine patients completed the European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire prestudy, with 5 (56%) also completing it poststudy. Interviews with 9 patients, 4 nurses, and 1 physiotherapist led to the identification of themes instrumental to implementation: a supportive community dialysis unit, shared responsibility, knowledge of patients/providers, and benefits associated with engagement. Themes that were identified as being key to acceptability in this remote dialysis unit were trust, connection, and engagement through common values. Limitations: Due to dialysis unit size, we had a small number of participants. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing best practice in a remote community and provides insight into the elements of context and participation that contribute to acceptability in the implementation of intradialytic cycling.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jost, F</author><author>Dale, A</author><author>Schwebel, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How positive is "change" in climate change?

Results were obtained from interviews conducted with local government officials in 11 communities across British Columbia: Victoria, Vancouver, Prince George, Dawson Creek, North Vancouver, Campbell River, Revelstoke, Surrey, T'Sou-ke First Nation, West Vancouver, and the Kootenay Regional Districts. The sentiment analysis was undertaken to address the lack of agreement among climate researchers and policy-makers over the meaning of change, and to determine whether changes were actually occurring in their development paths. As a result, several drivers and barriers to change were identified at the local government level. Staff quality and horizontal integration were linked to the most positive sentiments, whereas barriers to behavioral change and the limited pace and scale of change were associated with negative sentiments.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;81</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jost, F</author><author>Dale, A</author><author>Newell, R</author><author>Robinson, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate action assessment in three small municipalities in British Columbia: advancements vis-a-vis major neighboring cities</title><secondary-title>CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CURRENT RESEARCH IN ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY</full-title></periodical><volume>2</volume><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>FRAMEWORK</keyword><keyword>Local government</keyword><keyword>ADAPTATION</keyword><keyword>Assessment framework</keyword><keyword>Climate action</keyword><keyword>Development path</keyword><keyword>MITIGATION</keyword><keyword>Policy strategies</keyword><keyword>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</keyword><keyword>TRANSITIONS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2666-0490</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.crsust.2020.100010</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper applied a recently developed Local Government Climate Action Assessment Framework to identify whether small municipalities in British Columbia are on track to meet their climate targets and to better understand the effectiveness of their climate-related actions. The aim of this paper was (1) to further test the assessment framework by evaluating its applicability for smaller municipalities, (2) to evaluate and categorize local progress in three small cities, namely Campbell River, Prince George and Revelstoke, and (3) to contrast these climate actions with actions taken by larger municipalities in BC, using the same assessment framework. This assessment revealed that key external support made available to expand on their Integrated Community Sustainability Plans provided for striking similarities among the three case studies regarding their strategies and plan formulations for which actions were largely transformative or reformative. However, the three small cities were lacking periodic reporting and monitoring of actions and presented shorter timeframes of up to 20-50 years for their planning horizons, all of which negatively impact their prioritization strategies. The main difference between larger and smaller cities was found among actions related to the feedback and evaluation category of the framework, with smaller cities performing more poorly. Greater shift in priorities away from climate change-related actions were evident in smaller local governments, signalling their more vulnerable position regarding changes in leadership in local and provincial administrations. This study highlights the key role that strategic alliances, networks, and external champions as partners play in planning and implementing climate action and in increasing public interest in sustainability. Thus, these should be fostered and promoted to keep building local capacity and effectively accelerate greater change through e.g., strengthening their capacity to implement, monitor and evaluate climate actions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;90</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jorgensen, B</author><author>LundbyeChristensen, S</author><author>Song, XK</author><author>Sun, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A longitudinal study of emergency room visits and air pollution for Prince George, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>STATISTICS IN MEDICINE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>STATISTICS IN MEDICINE</full-title></periodical><pages>823-836</pages><volume>15</volume><number>7-9</number><issue>7-9</issue><keywords><keyword>COMMUNITY</keyword><keyword>MODELS</keyword><keyword>TIME-SERIES</keyword><keyword>UTAH VALLEY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0277-6715,1097-0258</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19960415)15:7/9&lt;823::AID-SIM252&gt;3.3.CO;2-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A new method for regression analysis of longitudinal counts is applied to data from Prince George, British Columbia, previously analysed by Knight et al.

Growing evidence suggests that using mobile phones for health (mHealth) may be a powerful way to support connection with health services, including HIV prevention and treatment. Objective: This study examined the patterns of mobile phone ownership and use among young Indigenous people who have used drugs living with or vulnerable to HIV and explored the acceptability of mHealth to support access to health care in this population. Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Indigenous people who have used drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. This mixed methods exploratory study involved 131 Cedar Project participants enrolled in our WelTel mHealth program. At enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire related to mobile phone use and interest in mHealth. Data were linked to Cedar Project questionnaires and serodata. We present comparative statistics (quantitative) and results of a rapid thematic analysis (qualitative) related to mobile phone patterns and interest in receiving mHealth. Results: Less than half of the participants (59/130; 45.4%) reported owning a phone. Among those with a phone, the majority owned a smartphone (46/59; 78%). Most participants with a phone reported having an unlimited texting plan (39/55; 71%), using the internet on their phone (44/59; 75%), and texting daily (44/55; 80%). A majority reported that using a mobile phone for health would be invaluable (120/130; 92.3%). There were no differences in mHealth acceptance between participants who owned a phone and those who did not (P&gt;.99). All but one participant living with HIV felt using a mobile phone would be helpful for their health, while a small proportion of HIV-negative participants remained unsure (1.9% vs 11.7%; P=.047). In response to open-ended questions asking why using a mobile phone may be helpful for health, participants identified a diverse set of anticipated benefits: (1) connection for emotional, mental, and spiritual support, (2) connection to family, (3) staying in touch and/or being reachable, (4) overcoming current barriers to phone use, (5) convenience, privacy, and safety, and (6) access to health care and emergency services. Conclusions: We observed high acceptance and interest in using mobile phone technology for health despite low rates of personal mobile phone connectivity among young Indigenous people who have used drugs living with and vulnerable to HIV in British Columbia, Canada. Mobile phones were viewed as a way to support connections and relationships that are seen as critical to health and well-being among young Indigenous people in this study Findings may be useful for health care providers preparing to scale up mHealth programs to support HIV prevention and treatment in this population.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;83</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jongbloed, K</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Pooyak, S</author><author>Zamar, D</author><author>Thomas, V</author><author>Demerais, L</author><author>Christian, WM</author><author>Henderson, E</author><author>Sharma, R</author><author>Blair, AH</author><author>Yoshida, EM</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: mortality among young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>E1352-E1359</pages><volume>189</volume><number>44</number><issue>44</issue><keywords><keyword>HIV</keyword><keyword>ABORIGINAL PEOPLE</keyword><keyword>NON-INJECTION DRUGS</keyword><keyword>2 CANADIAN CITIES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0820-3946,1488-2329</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1503/cmaj.160778</electronic-resource-num><abstract>BACKGROUND: Young Indigenous people, particularly those involved in the child welfare system, those entrenched in substance use and those living with HIV or hepatitis C, are dying prematurely. We report mortality rates among young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia and explore predictors of mortality over time. METHODS: We analyzed data collected every 6 months between 2003 and 2014 by the Cedar Project, a prospective cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios using Indigenous and Canadian reference populations. We identified predictors of mortality using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Among 610 participants, 40 died between 2003 and 2014, yielding a mortality rate of 670 per 100 000 person-years. Young Indigenous people who used drugs were 12.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.2-17.5) times more likely to die than all Canadians the same age and were 7.8 (95% CI 5.6-10.6) times more likely to die than Indigenous people with Status in BC. Young women and those using drugs by injection were most affected. The leading causes of death were overdose (n = 15 [38%]), illness (n = 11 [28%]) and suicide (n = 5 [12%]). Predictors of mortality included having hepatitis C at baseline (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.47-5.16), previous attempted suicide (adjusted HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.01-3.50) and recent overdose (adjusted HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.00-8.09). INTERPRETATION: Young Indigenous people using drugs in BC are dying at an alarming rate, particularly young women and those using injection drugs. These deaths likely reflect complex intersections of historical and present-day injustices, substance use and barriers to care.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;43</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jongbloed, K</author><author>Friedman, AJ</author><author>Pearce, ME</author><author>Van Der Kop, ML</author><author>Thomas, V</author><author>Demerais, L</author><author>Pooyak, S</author><author>Schechter, MT</author><author>Lester, RT</author><author>Spittal, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth intervention for HIV prevention in young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial</title><secondary-title>TRIALS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TRIALS</full-title></periodical><volume>17</volume><keywords><keyword>Indigenous</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>PREVALENCE</keyword><keyword>ABORIGINAL PEOPLE</keyword><keyword>ADHERENCE</keyword><keyword>CARE</keyword><keyword>HISTORICAL TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>HIV prevention</keyword><keyword>mHealth</keyword><keyword>MOBILE PHONES</keyword><keyword>NON-INJECTION DRUGS</keyword><keyword>RESILIENCE</keyword><keyword>Substance use</keyword><keyword>VULNERABILITY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1745-6215</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1186/s13063-016-1250-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: Despite successes in preventing and treating HIV, Indigenous people in Canada continue to face disproportionately high rates of HIV infection. Programs that support healing from lifetime trauma, support connection to culture, and reduce drug-related harms are critical to preventing HIV among young Indigenous people who use drugs. The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth intervention proposed here is a structured mobile-phone initiative to connect young Indigenous people who use drugs with Cedar Case Managers in a community-based setting. The intervention consists of a package of supports, including a mobile phone and cellular plan, weekly two-way text messaging, and support from Cedar Case Managers. Methods: The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth study is a multi-site Zelen pre-randomized trial to measure the effect of a two-way supportive text-message intervention to reduce HIV vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in two Canadian cities. The trial is nested within the Cedar Project, an ongoing cohort study addressing HIV and hepatitis C vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. The Cedar Project Partnership, an independent body of Indigenous Elders, leaders, and health/social service experts, governs all aspects of the study. Two hundred participants will be followed over a 16-month period, with HIV propensity score at 6 months as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include HIV propensity at 1 year, HIV risk, resilience, psychological distress, access to drug-related services, and connection to culture measured at 6 months and 1 year. Primary analysis is by intention to treat. Discussion: Culturally safe interventions that address barriers to HIV prevention while supporting the strength of young Indigenous people who use drugs are urgently needed. Despite presenting a tremendous opportunity to connect young, highly transient Indigenous people who use drugs to prevention services, supportive two-way mHealth programs have yet to be tested for HIV prevention in a community-based setting with this population.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;64</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jongbloed, K</author><author>Bingham, B</author><author>Schechter, M</author><author>Spittal, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: Unstable Housing and HIV vulnerability among young aboriginal men and women who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>S229-S229</pages><volume>173</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-9262,1476-6256</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jones, JMC</author><author>Massicotte, HB</author><author>Fredeen, AL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Calcium and pH co-restrict abundance of Drosera rotundifolia (Droseraceae) in a Sphagnum bog in central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>BOTANY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BOTANY</full-title></periodical><pages>139-146</pages><volume>94</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>calcium</keyword><keyword>BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>POPULATION</keyword><keyword>NUTRITION</keyword><keyword>CALCIFUGE</keyword><keyword>carnivorous plants</keyword><keyword>CARNIVOROUS PLANTS</keyword><keyword>Drosera anglica</keyword><keyword>Drosera rotundifolia</keyword><keyword>ECOLOGY</keyword><keyword>EXCHANGE</keyword><keyword>GRADIENTS</keyword><keyword>PEATLAND</keyword><keyword>Sphagnum peatlands</keyword><keyword>WATER-CHEMISTRY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1916-2790,1916-2804</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjb-2015-0136</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The genus Drosera (sundews) is represented in British Columbia (BC), Canada, by Drosera rotundifolia (L.), Drosera anglica (Huds.), and their hybrid Drosera x obovata (Mert. &amp; W.D.J. Koch). All three can be found in Sphagnum bogs of central BC, including those within the Aleza Lake Research Forest (ALRF) located 60 km east of Prince George. Vegetation patterns in bogs are known to be correlated with light, water, and nutrient gradients, and despite information being available on the influence of light and water on Drosera occurrence, little information is known about the role of nutrients. Here, we focused on a bog containing all three Drosera species, to determine whether nutrient levels are related to the abundance of the widespread species, D. rotundifolia. Univariate regression tree analysis between soil water chemistry and D. rotundifolia numbers indicates that D. rotundifolia is a calcifuge, preferring moderately acidic soil pH (&gt;5.5) and relatively low calcium levels (&lt;2.88 ppm). This study provides evidence that high soil water calcium and low pH limit the growth of D. rotundifolia in field populations. The physiology underlying this preference, how this is affected by hybridization between other sundew species, and how this mineralogical limitation interacts with other niche-defining factors to dictate the occurrence of D. rotundifolia are questions that remain to be answered.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnston, KS</author><author>Jamieson, B</author><author>Jones, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating extreme avalanche runout for the Columbia Mountains and Fernie area Rocky Mountains of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>1309-1318</pages><volume>49</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>alpha-beta</keyword><keyword>runout ratio</keyword><keyword>snow avalanche runout</keyword><keyword>statistical model</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3674</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/T2012-079</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Extreme snow avalanche runout is typically estimated using a combination of historical and vegetation records as well as statistical and dynamic models. The two classes of statistical models (alpha beta and runout ratio) are based on estimating runout distance past the beta-point, which is typically defined as the point where the avalanche slope incline first decreases to 10. The parameters for these models vary from mountain range to mountain range. In Canada, alpha-beta and runout ratio parameters have been published for the combined Rocky and Purcell Mountains and for the British Columbia Coast Mountains. Despite active development, no suitable tall avalanche path model parameters have been published for the Columbia Mountains or for the Lizard Range area around Fernie, B.C. Using a dataset of 65 avalanche paths, statistical model parameters have been derived for these regions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, LM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Plants and habitats - a consideration of Dene ethnoecology in northwestern Canada</title><secondary-title>BOTANY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BOTANY</full-title></periodical><pages>146-156</pages><volume>86</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>ethnoecology</keyword><keyword>traditional ecological knowledge</keyword><keyword>ALPINE ICE PATCHES</keyword><keyword>Dene</keyword><keyword>ethnobotany</keyword><keyword>GITKSAN</keyword><keyword>PERCEPTION</keyword><keyword>plant habitats</keyword><keyword>SOUTHWEST YUKON</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1916-2790,1916-2804</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/B07-126</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper discusses local understanding of plants and habitats, based on the linguistic evidence [terms for plants and (or) habitats] gathered from ethnobotanical and ethnoecological field work conducted with several Dene Nations of the Canadian northwestern boreal forest and adjacent regions. Nations involved in the study include Gwich' in (Mackenzie Delta Region), Sahtu otine' (Great Bear Lake), Kaska Dena (southern Yukon), and Witsuwit'en (northwest British Columbia). Key plant-related habitats include meadow, "swamp", forest, "willows", and "brush". The ethnobotanical classification of willows is explored in conjunction with the explanation of the Dene habitat concept. In local classifications, 'willow' is not co-extensive with the genus Salix, but includes a variety of medium to tall woody shrubs that lack either conspicuous flowers, 'berries', or thorns; these may include shrubby species of Salix, Alnus, Cornus, and Betula. Shoreline and alpine environments are also discussed as plant habitats. Dene use of alpine environments and resources is ancient, according to the results of recent alpine ice patch research in the Yukon region. The Human dimensions of habitat knowledge are presented. Indigenous concepts of plant taxa and of landscape associations or habitats may differ substantially from those of scientific botany and ecology, and are based in a holistic and interactive ethnoecology.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, K</author><author>Smith, DJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dendroglaciological reconstruction of late-Holocene glacier activity at White and South Flat glaciers, Boundary Range, northern British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada</title><secondary-title>HOLOCENE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HOLOCENE</full-title></periodical><pages>987-995</pages><volume>22</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Coast Mountains</keyword><keyword>dendrochronology</keyword><keyword>FLUCTUATIONS</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>dendroglaciology</keyword><keyword>NEOGLACIAL HISTORY</keyword><keyword>Cambria Icefield</keyword><keyword>DECADAL VARIABILITY</keyword><keyword>MASS-BALANCE</keyword><keyword>RECORDS</keyword><keyword>WADDINGTON AREA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959-6836,1477-0911</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0959683612437866</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Holocene glacier activity in the northern British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada, is described following investigations in the recently deglaciated forefields of White and South Flat glaciers spilling from the Cambria Icefield. Glacially overridden stumps and detrital wood was radiocarbon and dendrochronologically dated to describe an advance between ad 250 and 650. Expansion and thickening of White Glacier by ad 765 resulted in creation of an ice-dammed lake in South Flat valley that persisted until ad 1080. Following this the lake drained, before refilling in the early 'Little Ice Age' prior to ad 1300. Shortly thereafter White and South Flat glaciers became confluent and flowed over the valley side toward White Lake. The characteristics of the site and the preservation of 1500 yr old deposits indicate that the two glaciers remained confluent throughout the remainder of the 'Little Ice Age', only separating following terminal retreat early in the 20th century. The late-Holocene glacial history of White and South Flat glaciers appears synchronous with those of other glaciers in northern portion of Pacific Northwest.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Janecky, Rich</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Underwater loggers mine the lakes for sunken tree stems and logs</title><secondary-title>Business Logger</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Business Logger</full-title></periodical><pages>41-45</pages><volume>6</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>log_salvage</keyword><keyword>reservoirs</keyword><keyword>underwater_logging</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996-05</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The damming of the Nechako River created a huge reservoir to provide hydro power to Alcan's aluminum smelter in Kitimat.  Alcan hurriedly flooded the 65 000 ha  valley without harvesting any of the 17 million cubic metres of the valley's timber. International Marine Logging recently bid on three tenures to harvest the submerged forest.  During the late 1970s and through the 1980s IML salvaged logs from Lake Cowichan on Vancouver Island. Since 1990 IML has invested in product testing, feasibility studies and securing  financing to seek the Nechako reservoir timber salvaging rights and is now waiting for the government to make timber licence awards. Until recently, the logs and tree stems pulled from the bottom of lakes, reservoirs and waterways were assumed good only for pulp.  The Nechako reservoir timber does not have enough fibre strength for the Council of Forest Industries to approve it for use as stress-grade lumber. But Nichols and IML have found a way to circumvent the problem.  They extracted a sample of logs from the bottom of Nechako reservoir and shipped them to Oregon for testing. With the help of modern equipment it was discovered that the salvaged timber could be manufactured into veneers that can be used for producing plywood. Forest Renewal B.C. allocated funds to help develop the equipment for the underwater logging operations. Last year the Crown corporation, with an annual budget of $400 million, allocated $350,000 for underwater logging research and development. Bluewater Marine Services Ltd has designed an unmanned submersible which can be operated hydraulically from a barge like an underwater feller-buncher. It fastens itself to the tree while it cuts it down. Developed in Victoria and manufactured in Vancouver the submersible device is expected to be sent to Kinbasket Lake for testing later this month. The Kinbasket reservoir was flooded in 1973. It contains primarily hemlock, cedar, and fir which was flooded by the building of the Mica Dam.</abstract><remote-database-name>CiteULike</remote-database-name></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>James, C.

Approval of the project requires a two level release structure at Kenney Dam at the head of the Nechako Canyon to manage downstream flows and water temperatures to conserve and protect chinook and sockeye populations. Two- and three-dimensional mathematical models were used to evaluate the hydrothermal characteristics of the Nechako Reservoir and to assess the capability of the proposed structure to provide releases necessary to meet downstream objectives. Results of the modelling show that deep water intake temperatures are sensitive to reservoir surface elevation and the deep water intake elevation. Modelling results for maximum release of 200 m3/s show that the deep water intake invert should be located at an elevation of 795 m to ensure water temperature criteria are met. The three dimensional modelling showed that little, if any additional bottom water mixing beyond that indicated by the two dimensional results for a nearby lake is likely to occur as a result of the Kenamo completion project. Extreme condition analysis shows that there exists sufficient volumes of cold water in the Nechako reservoir to ensure that the 10 degree C water release criteria can be met for the required period</abstract><remote-database-name>inis.iaea.org</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://inis.iaea.org/Search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:26008191</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-08-11 19:08:21</access-date><custom3>10th Canadian hydrotechnical conference [and] engineering mechanics symposium.

We have developed a technique for quantitative assessment of tracheid characteristics by measuring cross-sectional dimensions. We obtained cell size, wall thickness and their ratio in early-, transition-, and late-wood classes within a growth ring. Tracheid length and microfibril angle were measured in the transition wood. A number of tracheid characteristics showed significant genetic variation, but heritability, phenotypic, and genetic correlation estimates varied across test sites within and outside regions of origin of parental trees. Ring width was determined, both phenotypically and genetically, by the number of tracheids and to a lesser extent by the by their mean size. On average, rings with larger tracheids did not have significantly thicker walls. Wider rings had lower mean wall to tracheid size ratio. Faster growth did not result in shorter tracheids in the transition wood. Longer tracheids had lower microfibril angle. There were no particular benefits from considering the anatomical Component traits for breaking the negative genetic correlation between growth and wood density.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ivkovich, M</author><author>Namkoong, G</author><author>Koshy, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genetic variation in wood properties of interior spruce.

The study included 100 half-sib families from the East Kootenay and Prince George regions. At the time of sampling, progeny tests for those two regions were 20 and 22 years old, respectively. Univariate and multivariate restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimates of genetic parameters were obtained. Estimates of genetic variances and heritabilities differed greatly across planting sites for the examined traits, especially after transplantation between the regions, Significant negative genetic correlation between overall growth and wood density was found for the East Kootenay progenies, while negative but nonsignificant genetic correlation between these traits was found for the Prince George progenies. Generally, there was no significant decrease in heritability for ring width and latewood percentage in successive growth rings. A general age trend for genetic correlation between those traits was not apparent, except that the correlation remained negative during the observed period. Our results show that it is not possible to select certain families as superior based on 1-year results because of the family by growing season interactions. Nevertheless, genetic age-age correlations for cumulative increments were high, having a decreasing trend with increasing difference in age.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Islam, SU</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Werner, AT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Future Climate Change Impacts on Snow and Water Resources of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>473-496</pages><volume>18</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>PRECIPITATION</keyword><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>REGIONAL-SCALE HYDROLOGY</keyword><keyword>VIC-2L MODEL</keyword><keyword>CMIP5</keyword><keyword>DECLINING MOUNTAIN SNOWPACK</keyword><keyword>DISCHARGE</keyword><keyword>DOWNSCALING EXTREMES</keyword><keyword>UNCERTAINTIES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1525-755X,1525-7541</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1175/JHM-D-16-0012.1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Changes in air temperature and precipitation can modify snowmelt-driven runoff in snowmelt-dominated regimes. This study focuses on climate change impacts on the snow hydrology of the Fraser River basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC). Statistically downscaled forcing datasets based on 12 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are used to drive VIC for two 30-yr time periods, a historical baseline (1980-2009) and future projections (2040-69: 2050s), under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The ensemble-based VIC simulations reveal widespread and regionally coherent spatial changes in snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow cover over the FRB by the 2050s. While the mean precipitation is projected to increase slightly, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is projected to decrease by nearly 50% in the 2050s compared to the baseline. Snow accumulation and snow-covered area are projected to decline substantially across the FRB, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. Onset of springtime snowmelt in the 2050s is projected to be nearly 25 days earlier than historically, yielding more runoff in the winter and spring for the Fraser River at Hope, BC, and earlier recession to low-flow volumes in summer. The ratio of snowmelt contribution to runoff decreases by nearly 20% in the Stuart and Nautley subbasins of the FRB in the 2050s. The decrease in SWE and loss of snow cover is greater from low to midelevations than in high elevations, where temperatures remain sufficiently cold for precipitation to fall as snow.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;108</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Irving, E</author><author>Thorkelson, DJ</author><author>Wheadon, PM</author><author>Enkin, RJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paleomagnetism of the Spences Bridge Group and Northward displacement of the Intermontane Belt, British-Columbia- A 2nd look</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH</full-title></periodical><pages>6057-6071</pages><volume>100</volume><number>B4</number><issue>B4</issue><keywords><keyword>VOLCANIC-ROCKS</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>TECTONICS</keyword><keyword>AGE</keyword><keyword>AMERICA</keyword><keyword>CRETACEOUS CARMACKS GROUP</keyword><keyword>MOTION</keyword><keyword>OMINECA BELT</keyword><keyword>TERRANE-I</keyword><keyword>WHITEHORSE-TROUGH</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2169-9313,2169-9356</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1029/94JB03012</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Spences Bridge Group is a mid-Cretaceous (104 Ma) volcanic succession in the southern Intermontane Belt of the Canadian Cordillera (50.5 degrees N,121 degrees W). It comprises the Pimainus Formation (mafic to felsic lava, volcaniclastic and interbedded epiclastic rocks) and the overlying Spius Formation (andesitic lava flows). Including previous work, we have 55 sites distributed among 15 localities representing most of the &gt; 3000 m thickness. Forty-seven sites (286 oriented cores, 457 specimens), mainly andesites, yielded acceptable data. The beds are gently to moderately tilted, partly due to synvolcanic deformation. Samples taken from a sequence of flows at any one locality have, with one exception, well-grouped magnetization directions. Polarities are all normal, as expected for rocks laid down in the Cretaceous Normal Superchron. Declinations always are clockwise of that expected of cratonic North America, indicating 60 degrees rotation of the Spences Bridge Group as a whole. However, declinations differ from locality to locality, implying relative interlocality rotations about vertical axes. Hence inclination-only analysis has been used to estimate dispersion, mean inclination, and paleolatitude. Minimum dispersion for the Spius Formation (27 sites) was achieved after 80% untilting, but the changes between 80 and 100% untilting are insignificant, indicating that magnetization was acquired predominantly before tilting. By contrast, minimum dispersion for the Pimainus Formation (20 sites) was achieved after 50% untilting, indicating that magnetization was acquired after synvolcanic tilting when buried beneath the overlying Spius Formation. Polished thin section studies show that magnetite in the Pimainus Formation has undergone extensive low temperature hydrothermal alteration, whereas magnetite in the Spius Formation shows little alteration. Throughout the range of tilt correction, from 0% to 100%, the mean inclinations of both formations were less than expected from observations obtained from mid-Cretaceous rocks of cratonic North America. The best estimate of paleolatitude (from the Spius Formation) is 50.8 degrees +/- 5.0 degrees (P=0.05), which is 9.5 degrees +/- 5.7 degrees less than would be expected had the rocks had been rigidly attached to North America. This corresponds to displacement from the south of 1100 +/- 600 km. Displacement between the northern Intermontane Belt and craton probably was accommodated along major strike-slip faults (Northern Rocky Mountain Trench, Finlay, Pinchi etc.). In the south, our results require a major dextral fault (the Intra-Quesnellia fault) to be situated during Late Cretaceous or Paleocene time within or marginal to the Omineca Belt, along which about 1000 km of dextral motion occurred. This could be a southern extension of the Pinchi Fault whose trace is now obscured by Eocene extension and tectonic denudation. The results also indicate that the largest tectonic discontinuity in the Canadian Cordillera occurs not to the east of the Intermontane Belt, as commonly assumed, but to the west, because the displacements relative to cratonic North America observed from the Intermontane Belt are only about one third of those observed from the-Coast Belt.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;49</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imam, YE</author><author>Laval, B</author><author>Pieters, R</author><author>Lawrence, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The strongly damped baroclinic response to wind in a multibasin reservoir</title><secondary-title>LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY</full-title></periodical><pages>1243-1258</pages><volume>58</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>OSCILLATIONS</keyword><keyword>SCALE INTERNAL WAVES</keyword><keyword>SEASONAL EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>SEICHES</keyword><keyword>STRATIFIED LAKE</keyword><keyword>SURFACE</keyword><keyword>VERTICAL-MODE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0024-3590,1939-5590</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4319/lo.2013.58.4.1243</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Field data and a forced, modal-based, two-layer, variable-cross-section model (TLVC) were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in a large multibasin reservoir, Nechako Reservoir (British Columbia, Canada). The TLVC showed that most of the thermocline deflections at the dam could be accounted for by considering the first two basins upstream of the dam, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and that the thermocline deflections were dominated by the first (H1) and second (H2) horizontal baroclinic modes of the combined basins. Calibration of the TLVC against the field data showed that the H1 and H2 modes were strongly damped, with effectively no free thermocline oscillations. This strong damping had two effects: high coherence between the wind and thermocline deflections and phase lags between thermocline deflections at different locations. The damping in Nechako Reservoir is stronger than in many lakes, and results from both high velocities within the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes and drag due to submerged trees, which cover 30% of the bed. Our study provides a picture of overdamped baroclinic response and shows how useful information about the baroclinic response in complex bathymetries can be obtained using relatively simple tools such as the TLVC.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;10 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Imam, YE</author><author>Laval, B</author><author>Pieters, R</author><author>Lawrence, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The baroclinic response to wind in a multiarm multibasin reservoir</title><secondary-title>LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>LIMNOLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY</full-title></periodical><pages>582-600</pages><volume>65</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>DYNAMICS</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>CIRCULATION</keyword><keyword>SCALE INTERNAL WAVES</keyword><keyword>STRATIFIED LAKE</keyword><keyword>VERTICAL-MODE</keyword><keyword>CLIMATOLOGY</keyword><keyword>LAYER</keyword><keyword>MOTIONS</keyword><keyword>SEICHE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0024-3590,1939-5590</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/lno.11328</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Field data, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic numerical model, and modal decomposition were used to examine the baroclinic response to wind in two interconnected multiarm lakes, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes (British Columbia, Canada). Similar to lakes of simpler geometry, the first-vertical first-horizontal mode (V1H1) of Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes was found to be the most energetic mode. This V1H1 dominance is attributed to similarity between the relatively uniform distributions of along-thalweg wind and surface-layer flow for the V1H1 mode. Two bathymetric features, the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and changes in thalweg orientation relative to the wind field act to create subbasins in which wind forcing causes local metalimnetic tilts. These subbasin scale tilts deepen the metalimnion at the downwind ends of the subbasins, raise the metalimnion at the upwind ends, and are superimposed on the lake-wide V1H1 tilt. The metalimnetic tilts in the subbasins are attributed to higher horizontal modes that are equivalent to V1H1 modes of the subbasins. Because the thickness of the metalimnion is significant, the subbasin metalimnetic tilts occur with variations in the metalimnetic thickness along the subbasins; the metalimnion is compressed at the downwind end and expanded at the other end of each subbasin. This variability in thickness leads to metalimnetic intrusions following the relaxation of wind forcing. The findings of this study contribute to characterizing the baroclinic response to wind in lakes of complex bathymetry. In particular, this study helps in understanding the effect of bathymetric features on modal composition of the baroclinic response.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;57</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Idowu, OA</author><author>Frederiksen, AW</author><author>Cassidy, JF</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Imaging the Nechako Basin, British Columbia, using ambient seismic noise</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1038-1049</pages><volume>48</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>EMERGENCE</keyword><keyword>WAVE TOMOGRAPHY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E11-007</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Nechako Basin in British Columbia, Canada is suspected to have hydrocarbon potential. However, it has been a difficult basin to explore because of the presence of Tertiary volcanic outcrop. The volcanic outcrop makes the use of conventional seismic exploration methods difficult owing to a strong velocity inversion at its base. An alternative is the passive source method known as ambient noise surface wave tomography. The method, which examines the high-frequency surface wave field that is obtained from noise analysis, is sensitive to large-scale crustal structure and has been successfully applied to measuring the depths of sedimentary basins. Station-to-station Green's functions within the basin were estimated by cross-correlating the vertical components of the seismic noise data recorded by 12 POLARIS (Portable Observatories for Lithosphere Analysis and Research Investigating Seismicity) and CNSN (Canadian National Seismgraph Network) seismic stations between September 2006 and November 2007. The resulting Green's functions were dominated by Rayleigh waves. The dispersion characteristics of the Rayleigh waveforms were measured within the microseismic band. Inversion of the dispersion curves produced 1-D and 2-D thickness models and 2-D group velocity models for the Nechako Basin and its surrounding region. The velocity models indicate two low group velocity structures within the basin that might represent sedimentary packages, and some pockets of high-velocity zones that show the presence of volcanic rocks within and on the basin. The thickness models indicated the presence of about six different velocity layers, in which the average thickness of the basin and the crust are similar to 4.8 and 30-34 km, respectively.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hutton, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prince George Pulp and paper-mills quality assurance program.</title></titles><periodical><full-title>77TH ANNUAL MEETING : TECHNICAL SECTION CANADIAN PULP AND PAPER ASSOCIATION</full-title></periodical><pages>A7-A11</pages><dates><year>1991</year><pub-dates><date>1991</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0-919893-98-8</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>77TH ANNUAL MEETING : TECHNICAL SECTION CANADIAN PULP AND PAPER ASSOCIATION</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunter, C</author><author>Moore, RD</author><author>McKendry, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) precipitation fields in a topographically complex domain</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES</full-title></periodical><pages>786-799</pages><volume>65</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>precipitation</keyword><keyword>UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>uncertainty</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW</keyword><keyword>DISCHARGE</keyword><keyword>North American Regional Reanalysis</keyword><keyword>SETS</keyword><keyword>SUITABILITY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0262-6667,2150-3435</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02626667.2019.1591624</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR) precipitation product was evaluated using station observations and catchment water yield in British Columbia (BC), Canada, at inter-annual, monthly, and daily time scales. A structural break occurred in 2003, associated with exclusion of Canadian precipitation gauge data from NARR's data assimilation process beginning in that year. The NARR product under-predicted precipitation in mountainous regions, over-predicted in the northern region of BC's Interior Plateau, and catchment-averaged NARR precipitation was less than observed water yield in coastal BC. The product was unable to reproduce even the seasonal pattern at three stations. This study highlights uncertainties associated with the NARR precipitation product, and presents a cautionary tale that is likely relevant not only to the application of NARR in BC, but may be relevant for other re-analysis products and other regions with complex topography and sparse station networks.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunt, JA</author><author>Bustin, RM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thermal maturation and source rock potential of Cretaceous strata in the Chilcotin-Nechako region, south-central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>BULLETIN OF CANADIAN PETROLEUM GEOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>239-248</pages><volume>45</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>STRATIGRAPHY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0007-4802</isbn><abstract>The Chilcotin-Nechako region of south-central British Columbia includes a diverse succession of unexplored and poorly exposed elastic strata in excess of 4000 m thick, Rock-Eval pyrolysis and total organic carbon analyses of outcrop and well samples suggest the strata have low liquid hydrocarbon potential although better source rocks locally occur, Much of the Cretaceous and part of the Tertiary succession are within the oil window whereas pre-Cretaceous strata are mainly overmature, Strata in the Chilcotin-Nechako region are less mature than equivalent strata in basins to the north which is attributed to lower paleoheat flow.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hunsberger, C</author><author>Larsen, RK</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The spatial politics of energy conflicts: How competing constructions of scale shape pipeline and shale gas struggles in Canada</title><secondary-title>ENERGY RESEARCH &amp; SOCIAL SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENERGY RESEARCH &amp; SOCIAL SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><volume>77</volume><keywords><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>Energy conflict</keyword><keyword>Energy politics</keyword><keyword>Pipeline</keyword><keyword>Relational space</keyword><keyword>Scale</keyword><keyword>Shale gas</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2214-6296,2214-6326</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.erss.2021.102100</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Conflict characterizes energy projects across Canada and around the world. While claims about economics, the environment and Indigenous rights dominate headlines, energy conflicts also feature struggles over the construction of space and scale. Building on work in energy geographies, this paper compares the spatial politics of three contested fossil fuel projects, focusing on how antagonistic parties frame issues to advance their positions, in turn shaping perceptions of scale. Drawing on reports, media coverage, and other secondary sources, we examine: the Trans Mountain pipeline in Western Canada; the Coastal GasLink pipeline in Wet'suwet'en territory, British Columbia; and shale gas drilling in New Brunswick. The analysis reveals how actors construct space and scale to persuade, build alliances, and exclude people or issues from consideration. Project proponents generally 'scale up' claims about benefits and 'scale down' impacts, while opponents do the opposite - even as both strategically engage with governance at multiple scales. We argue that taking spatial politics seriously can reveal power dynamics in competing representations of space, improve transparency in energy project evaluations by unveiling tacit proponent strategies, and reveal biases in impact assessment and legal processes when their mandates favour the spatial strategies of project proponents.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;97</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hump, N</author><author>Ferris, R</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Alfaro, RI,Kiss, G,Fraser, RG</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Spruce Weevil population monitoring plots in the Prince George forest region.</title></titles><periodical><full-title>WHITE PINE WEEVIL: BIOLOGY, DAMAGE AND MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>90-97</pages><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0-7726-2340-6</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>WHITE PINE WEEVIL: BIOLOGY, DAMAGE AND MANAGEMENT</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hume, R</author><author>Walby, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Framing, Suppression, and Colonial Policing Redux in Canada: News Representations of the 2019 Wet'suwet'en Blockade</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES</full-title></periodical><pages>507-540</pages><volume>55</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>settler colonialism</keyword><keyword>COVERAGE</keyword><keyword>CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS</keyword><keyword>Indigenous resistance</keyword><keyword>MASS-MEDIA</keyword><keyword>media studies</keyword><keyword>PROTEST</keyword><keyword>public police</keyword><keyword>suppression</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0021-9495,1911-0251</isbn><abstract>In early 2019, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) intervened at the Gidimt'en Access Checkpoint in northern British Columbia (BC) and arrested 14 land defenders, garnering global media attention. To explore the ways that settler common sense (Rifkin 2013) is assembled and perpetuated in Canada, this paper examines how Wet'suwet'en mobilization is framed in news media coverage. Situating our work in relation to settler colonial studies and informed by the writings of Indigenous scholars, we use critical discourse analysis to assess mainstream news media framings of the Wet'suwet'en struggle. Drawing from literature on social movement suppression, we discern three main themes in these texts that work to validate the RCMP's excessive use of force against land defenders and delegitimize the Wet'suwet'en's claim to sovereignty. While this framing set the stage for sustained corporate incursions, police surveillance, and occupation across unceded Wet'suwet'en territory, we suggest negative framing as well as activist use of social media to visualize state repression may have created the conditions for what Hess and Martin (2006) call backfire.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;82</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howes, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eagle down is our law: Witsuwit'en law, feasts, and land claims - Mills,A</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SOCIOLOGIE ET D ANTHROPOLOGIE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN REVIEW OF SOCIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE SOCIOLOGIE ET D ANTHROPOLOGIE</full-title></periodical><pages>119-123</pages><volume>34</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4948</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Howard, C</author><author>Rose, CL</author><author>Trouton, K</author><author>Stamm, H</author><author>Marentette, D</author><author>Kirkpatrick, N</author><author>Karalic, S</author><author>Fernandez, R</author><author>Paget, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>FLOW (finding lasting options for women) Multicentre randomized controlled trial comparing tampons with menstrual cups</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN FAMILY PHYSICIAN</full-title></periodical><pages>E208-E215</pages><volume>57</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>COMPLAINTS</keyword><keyword>DIAGNOSIS</keyword><keyword>KNOWLEDGE</keyword><keyword>OXYGEN</keyword><keyword>PROTECTION</keyword><keyword>STAPHYLOCOCCUS-AUREUS</keyword><keyword>SYMPTOMS</keyword><keyword>TOXIC-SHOCK-SYNDROME</keyword><keyword>URINARY-TRACT INFECTION</keyword><keyword>VAGINAL MICROFLORA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-350X</isbn><abstract>Objective To determine whether menstrual cups are a viable alternative to tampons. Design Randomized controlled trial. Setting Prince George, Victoria, and Vancouver, BC. Participants A total of 110 women aged 19 to 40 years who had previously used tampons as their main method of menstrual management. Intervention Participants were randomized into 2 groups, a tampon group and a menstrual cup group. Using online diaries, participants tracked 1 menstrual cycle using their regular method and 3 menstrual cycles using the method of their allocated group. Main outcome measures Overall satisfaction; secondary outcomes included discomfort, urovaginal infection, cost, and waste. Results Forty-seven women in each group completed the final survey, 5 of whom were subsequently excluded from analysis (3 from the tampon group and 2 from the menstrual cup group). Overall satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale was higher for the menstrual cup group than for the tampon group (mean [standard deviation] score 5.4 [1.5] vs 5.0 [1.0], respectively; P = .04). Approximately 91% of women in the menstrual cup group said they would continue to use the cup and recommend it to others. Women used a median of 13 menstrual products per cycle, or 169 products per year, which corresponds to approximately 771 248 400 products used annually in Canada. Estimated cost for tampon use was $37.44 a year (similar to the retail cost of 1 menstrual cup). Subjective vaginal discomfort was initially higher in the menstrual cup group, but the discomfort decreased with continued use. There was no significant difference in physician-diagnosed urovaginal symptoms between the 2 groups. Conclusion Both of the menstrual management methods evaluated were well tolerated by subjects. Menstrual cups are a satisfactory alternative to tampons and have the potential to be a sustainable solution to menstrual management, with moderate cost savings and much-reduced environmental effects compared with tampons.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;30 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hollister, LS</author><author>Hargraves, RB</author><author>James, TS</author><author>Renne, PR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The paleomagnetic effects of reheating the Ecstall pluton, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS</full-title></periodical><pages>397-407</pages><volume>221</volume><number>1-4</number><issue>1-4</issue><keywords><keyword>PRINCE-RUPERT</keyword><keyword>STUART BATHOLITH</keyword><keyword>SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA</keyword><keyword>accreted terranes</keyword><keyword>Baja British Columbia</keyword><keyword>CENTRAL-GNEISS-COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>COAST SHEAR ZONE</keyword><keyword>CONTINENTAL-CRUST</keyword><keyword>cooling ages</keyword><keyword>core complex</keyword><keyword>DISPLACEMENTS</keyword><keyword>HEMATITE</keyword><keyword>ilmenohematite</keyword><keyword>lamellar magnetism</keyword><keyword>LAMELLAR MAGNETISM</keyword><keyword>remanent magnetization</keyword><keyword>TRANSLATION</keyword><keyword>uplift</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0012-821X,1385-013X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0012-821X(04)00067-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Paleomagnetic data of plutons from the western Canadian Cordillera are currently interpreted to indicate thousands of kilometers of latitudinal transport, in situ tilting, or post-intrusion folding. For the Ecstall pluton of British Columbia, the inclination of magnetic remanence directions steepens to the east from 16degrees to 81degrees [Butler et al., J. Geophys. Res. 107 (2002)] between 24 and 12 kin west of a thermal boundary with the Coast Mountains batholith (CMB). The CMB was at 700-800degreesC between 60 and 52 Ma. The. stable remanent magnetization is in ilmenohematite grains with exsolved lamellae of ferrian ilmenite. It has the characteristic properties of lamellar magnetism [Robinson et al., Nature 418 (2002) 517-520] which is acquired with exsolution in ilmenohematite below 390degreesC [Ghiorso, Phys. Chem. Minerals 25 (1997) 28-38]; thus, it is thermal chemical remanent magnetization (TCRM). Our heat flow calculations show that the thermal effects of Eocene CMB on the adjacent 91 Ma Ecstall pluton were enough to reset the remanent magnetization directions. Reheating to the temperatures necessary for TCRM is supported by K/Ar and Ar/Ar cooling dates on hornblende and biotite, which young from west to east towards the CMB in concert with the change in inclinations. Thus, the progressive steepening of magnetization inclinations is attributed to reheating during the Eocene of the 91 Ma Ecstall pluton by the CMB. This reheating followed post-solidification northward latitudinal displacement of the pluton. The amount of translational displacement of the coastal terranes of British Columbia prior to 60 Ma hinges on the interpretation of discordant magnetizations from plutons that may have cooled slowly after emplacement in the mid to lower crust, as was the case for the Ecstall pluton. Many of these plutons contain ilmenohematite as an accessory magnetic phase. Our interpretation for the low temperature acquisition of TCRM in the Ecstall pluton may have far-reaching implications for understanding enigmatic discordant paleomagnetic directions reported from plutons of the western Canadian Cordillera.

Multiple sediment proxies of lake production, as well as nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, all portray relatively complacent stratigraphies, despite well-monitored changes in salmon returns over the most recent 60 years. The separation of autochthonous from total sediment organic matter did not clarify the identification of the nitrogen isotopic fingerprint of marine-derived nutrients (MDN). Slight shifts in diatom assemblages are better interpreted as responses to either early human activities in the catchment or post-Little Ice Age climate warming. The low proportion of MDN in the lake's annual budget (3% N and 7% P) is the probable reason their influence is not expressed in lake sediments. Thus, paleolimnology is incapable of providing unequivocal inferences concerning historical salmon abundances in Fraser Lake, in contrast to lakes from southern Alaska, where the same techniques have yielded unambiguous results. Sediment MDN proxies, together with catchment characteristics and escapement data, were collated for an additional nine sockeye nursery lakes spanning southern Alaska to southern BC. Primary production and biogeochemical cycling in Alaskan nursery lakes appears largely driven by MDN from sockeye returns, whereas BC lakes are more strongly influenced by allochthonous organic matter and lake-water residence times. Alaskan lakes possess the limnological features that are prerequisite for meaningful salmon reconstructions using paleolimnology, while lakes from southern BC do not. This does not suggest that MDN are unimportant in southern BC lakes but rather that they are not readily disentangled from other factors that shape the paleolimnological record.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hoag, NA</author><author>Hamidizadeh, R</author><author>MacNeily, AE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Undergraduate exposure to urology: impact of the distributed model of medical education in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CUAJ-CANADIAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CUAJ-CANADIAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>20-25</pages><volume>7</volume><number>1-2</number><issue>1-2</issue><keywords><keyword>STUDENTS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1911-6470,1920-1214</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5489/cuaj.10101</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background: With the increased development of distributed sites for medical education across Canada, it is imperative we ensure that the quality of education is comparable between the different campuses. Our objective was to assess medical student experience and comfort with common urologic clinical encounters and to determine whether any differences exist between the distributed education sites at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Methods: Questionnaires assessing urologic education were delivered simultaneously to all final-year UBC medical students attending campuses in Vancouver, Victoria and Prince George. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Overall, 55.8% of students felt their exposure to urology was adequate in the medical curriculum; learners in the Northern Program (Prince George) ranked their clinical and didactic experiences significantly higher. Areas requiring improvement include teaching of the male genitourinary exam, digital rectal exam and sexual history, in which learners rated teaching "good/outstanding" in only 18.2%, 47.7% and 43.2% of cases, respectively. Overall, students were most comfortable with the following clinical encounters: urinary tract infection, nephrolithiasis, benign prostatic hyperplasia, hematuria, incontinence and prostate cancer. Few differences in student experience or comfort were noted related to campus site, gender or urology clerkship exposure. Conclusion: A significant minority of learners perceived that they had inadequate exposure to urology in the undergraduate curriculum. Experience in urology was comparable across the distributed sites and was congruent with teaching objectives. Students were comfortable with the clinical scenarios deemed most important in the literature. Learners in the Northern Program were significantly more satisfied with their urologic teaching, which potentially highlights the advantages of learning in a smaller academic setting.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hiyate, A</author><author>Werniuk, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth in molybdenum - Thompson creek expanding Endako; studying Davidson</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN MINING JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN MINING JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>13-14</pages><volume>129</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4492</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hirtz, B</author><author>Paulson, LM</author><author>Pettigrew, SR</author><author>Pasciolla, DJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Advanced control strategy reduces recovery boiler fouling while liquor throughput is increased</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>42-45</pages><volume>100</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>performance evaluation</keyword><keyword>ash</keyword><keyword>fouling</keyword><keyword>plugging</keyword><keyword>process control</keyword><keyword>recovery furnaces</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><abstract>An advanced process control strategy was implemented on the chemical recovery boiler Canadian Forest Products Ltd.

The camera installation produced a 22-point temperature profile along the length of the kiln. Preliminary data analysis was performed to assess the capability of the thermal cameras to predict product residual carbonate compared to conventional measurements. The cameras were also used for early detection of ring formation, brick loss, and other undesirable conditions. This paper provides a detailed review of the set-up and key findings from this project, which showed that the camera-based set-up improved residual carbonate predictability by up to 67% versus conventional measurements. The paper will also demonstrate the significant benefit of providing quick and easy detection of harmful operating conditions from thermal image analysis, leading to decreased shell damage, repair costs, and downtime.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hinch, SG</author><author>Rand, PS</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Swim speeds and energy use of upriver-migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka): role of local environment and fish characteristics</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1821-1831</pages><volume>55</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>TROUT</keyword><keyword>EXPENDITURE</keyword><keyword>TELEMETRY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0706-652X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfas-55-8-1821</electronic-resource-num><abstract>We used electromyogram (EMG) radiotelemetry to assess swimming activity (e.g., swim speeds), behaviour, and migration speeds (e.g., ground speeds) of individual adult sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) migrating through several reaches of the Fraser and Nechako rivers in British Columbia. Using a laboratory swim flume and volitionally swimming adult fish carrying EMG transmitters, we developed relationships between EMG pulse intervals and swim speeds. A bioenergetics model was used to estimate reach-specific energy use per metre for each individual based on the average swim speed, migration time, body size, and river temperature. Migration was most energetically efficient (i.e., migration costs per unit distance traveled were relatively low) for females compared with males, large males compared with small males, and 1995 males compared with 1993 males. In all three cases, differences in swim speed patterns were primarily responsible for differences in energy use. For both sexes and in both years, migrations through reaches that contained a constriction (caused by an island, gravel bar, or large rock outcropping) were energetically inefficient compared with that through reaches with no constrictions. The high energetic costs at constrictions seem to result from long travel times probably caused by turbulent flow patterns that may generate confusing migrational cues.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;177 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;193 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hill, RA</author><author>Irvine, JR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Standardizing spawner escapement data: A case study of the Nechako river Chinook salmon</title><secondary-title>NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>NORTH AMERICAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES MANAGEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>651-655</pages><volume>21</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>TIME</keyword><keyword>COUNTS</keyword><keyword>ONCORHYNCHUS-TSHAWYTSCHA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0275-5947,1548-8675</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1577/1548-8675(2001)021&lt;0651:SSEDAC&gt;2.0.CO;2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Spawner escapements for Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus spp. are frequently estimated by using a variety of methods over time. To evaluate temporal patterns in escapements, the data must be standardized. In our study, we standardized escapement data from 1980 to 1998 for the chinook salmon O. tshawytscha of the Nechako River in British Columbia. This particular stock and period were chosen because (1) escapement had been estimated by several methods that could be standardized and (2) escapement estimation methods and data had previously been summarized in detail and were readily available. The area-under-the-curve method of estimating escapement had been used since 1987, and after minor adjustments in 1989, methods had remained constant. To evaluate whether differences in methods for earlier years affected analysis of trends in escapement over time, we converted the data for years 1980-1988 to area-under-the-curve equivalents. The mean of reported escapements for the 1980-1988 period increased from 18% to 22% after standardization. The increase demonstrates the importance of standardizing data when analyzing trends in Pacific salmon escapement data.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hildebrand, LR</author><author>Schreier, AD</author><author>Lepla, K</author><author>McAdam, SO</author><author>McLellan, J</author><author>Parsley, MJ</author><author>Paragamian, VL</author><author>Young, SP</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Status of White Sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1863) throughout the species range, threats to survival, and prognosis for the future</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF APPLIED ICHTHYOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>261-312</pages><volume>32</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0175-8659,1439-0426</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jai.13243</electronic-resource-num><abstract>White Sturgeon, Acipenser transmontanus (WS), are distributed throughout three major river basins on the West Coast of North America: the Sacramento-San Joaquin, Columbia, and Fraser River drainages. Considered the largest North American freshwater fish, some WS use estuarine habitat and make limited marine movements between river basins. Some populations are listed by the United States or Canada as threatened or endangered (upper Columbia River above Grand Coulee Dam; Kootenai River; lower, middle and, upper Fraser River and Nechako River), while others do not warrant federal listing at this time (Sacramento-San Joaquin Rivers; Columbia River below Grand Coulee Dam; Snake River). Threats that impact WS throughout the species' range include fishing effects and habitat alteration and degradation. Several populations suffer from recruitment limitations or collapse due to high early life mortality associated with these threats. Efforts to preserve WS populations include annual monitoring, harvest restrictions, habitat restoration, and conservation aquaculture. This paper provides a review of current knowledge on WS life history, ecology, physiology, behavior, and genetics and presents the status of WS in each drainage. Ongoing management and conservation efforts and additional research needs are identified to address present and future risks to the species.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;429</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hilde, C</author><author>Woodward, R</author><author>Avramidis, S</author><author>Hartley, ID</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Acoustic Properties of Water Submerged Lodgepole Pine (Pinus contorta) and Spruce (Picea spp.) Wood and Their Suitability for Use as Musical Instruments</title><secondary-title>MATERIALS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>MATERIALS</full-title></periodical><pages>5688-5699</pages><volume>7</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>acoustic constant</keyword><keyword>characteristic impedance</keyword><keyword>submerged wood</keyword><keyword>wood</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1996-1944</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ma7085688</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Wood is a common material used for the manufacture of many products, and submerged wood, in particular, has been used in niche markets and musical instruments. In order to examine if submerged wood in British Columbia, Canada, would be appropriate for use as musical instruments, a study was performed in 2007 on submerged wood from Ootsa Lake, British Columbia, Canada. The results of that study showed the wood was not suitable for musical instruments. In this paper, the wood samples were allowed to age untouched in a laboratory setting and were then retested under the hypothesis that physical acoustic characteristics would improve. It was shown, however, that acoustic properties became less adequate after being left to dry over time.

The Cariboo Alpine Mesonet (CAMnet) forms a network of 11 active hydrometeorological stations positioned at strategic locations across mid- to high elevations of the Cariboo Mountains. This mountain region spans 44 150 km(2), forming the northern extension of the Columbia Mountains. Deep fjord lakes along with old-growth western redcedar and hemlock forests reside in the lower valleys, montane forests of Engelmann spruce, lodge-pole pine and subalpine fir permeate the mid-elevations, while alpine tundra, glaciers and several large ice fields cover the higher elevations. The automatic weather stations typically measure air and soil temperature, relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed and direction, rainfall and snow depth at 15 min intervals. Additional measurements at some stations include shortwave and longwave radiation, near-surface air, skin, snow, or water temperature, and soil moisture, among others. Details on deployment sites, the instrumentation used and its precision, the collection and quality control process are provided. Instructions on how to access the database at Zenodo, an online public data repository, are also furnished (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1195043). Information on some of the challenges and opportunities encountered in maintaining continuous and homogeneous time series of hydrometeorological variables and remote field sites is provided. The paper also summarizes ongoing plans to expand CAMnet to better monitor atmospheric conditions in BC's mountainous terrain, efforts to push data online in (near-)real time, availability of ancillary data and lessons learned thus far in developing this mesoscale network of hydrometeorological stations in the data-sparse Cariboo Mountains.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;3 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;39</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hernandez-Henriquez, MA</author><author>Sharma, AR</author><author>Dery, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability and trends in runoff in the rivers of British Columbia's Coast and Insular Mountains</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>3269-3282</pages><volume>31</volume><number>18</number><issue>18</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>FRASER-RIVER</keyword><keyword>NORTH-AMERICA</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>watersheds</keyword><keyword>Coast and Insular Mountains</keyword><keyword>hydrology</keyword><keyword>runoff</keyword><keyword>trends</keyword><keyword>variability</keyword><keyword>HYDROLOGICAL SIGNIFICANCE</keyword><keyword>LAKE ATHABASCA</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC DECADAL OSCILLATION</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>SOUTHEAST ALASKA</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW INPUT</keyword><keyword>WATER-RESOURCES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087,1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.11257</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This study examines the 1914-2015 runoff trends and variability for 136 rivers draining British Columbia's Coast and Insular Mountains. Rivers are partitioned into eastward and westward flowing rivers based on flow direction from the Coast Mountains. Thus, eastward and westward runoff trends and influence of topography on runoff are explored. Our findings indicate that rivers flowing eastward to the Nechako and Chilcotin plateaus contribute the lowest annual runoff compared to westward rivers where runoff is high. Low interannual runoff variability is evident in westward rivers and their alpine watersheds, whereas eastward rivers exhibit high interannual runoff variability. On Vancouver Island, some of the rivers with the highest annual runoff exhibit high interannual variability. A significant (p &lt; .05) negative correlation exists between mean annual runoff (R-m) and latitude, gauged area, mean elevation, and its corresponding coefficient of variation. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the glacierized area of mountainous regions and Rm. The mean coefficient of variation in annual runoff is significantly negatively correlated with latitude and glacierized area, but significantly positively correlated with longitude. Annual and seasonal runoff trend analyses of each river were performed for an early (1936-2015), a middle (1966-2015), and a late (1986-2015) period using the Mann-Kendall test. Trend analyses revealed a shift towards more positive detectable (signal-to-noise ratio &gt; 1) trends in annual and seasonal runoff from the middle to the late period across the study domain. Most positive detectable seasonal runoff trends in the middle period occur in spring in glacierized westward rivers located &gt; 1,200 m, whereas in the late period, they all occur in fall and are regionally coherent around Vancouver Island and south coastal BC. Rivers draining eastward exhibit more positive trends over 1986-2015 compared to westward rivers. This study provides crucial information on the hydrology of mountain watersheds across British Columbia's coast in response to Pacific Decadal Oscillation phase changes, the elevational amplification of regional climate change, and their influences on precipitation and glacier retreat.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;81</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hebda, RJ</author><author>Allen, GB</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modern pollen spectra from West Central British-Columbia.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY-REVUE CANADIENNE DE BOTANIQUE</full-title></periodical><pages>1486-1495</pages><volume>71</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>PRECIPITATION</keyword><keyword>POLLEN</keyword><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>BRITISH COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>USA</keyword><keyword>BIOGEOCLIMATIC ZONES</keyword><keyword>BOOTSTRAP</keyword><keyword>SPECIES COVER</keyword><keyword>SURFACE SPECTRA</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1993</year><pub-dates><date>1993</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4026</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/b93-180</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sixty-four moss and organic litter samples were collected from five biogeoclimatic zones distributed from sea level on the central coast of British Columbia onto the western edge of the Interior Plateau at 1000-1900 m and analyzed for pollen and spores. Four of the five biogeoclimatic zones produced characteristic pollen and spore spectra. The coastal western hemlock biogeoclimatic zone is characterized by Tsuga heterophylla, Alnus, and Cupressaceae. Significant levels of nonarboreal pollen (NAP), mainly Lysichiton and fern spores, occur in some sites. Interior Douglas-fir zone samples are dominated by Pseudotsuga and Tsuga heterophylla with notable Betula, Cupressaceae, and Alnus. Pinus pollen becomes the dominant type at the eastern margins of the interior Douglas-fir zone and dominates the Engelmann spruce - subalpine fir, montane spruce, and subboreal pine - spruce biogeoclimatic zones at high and intermediate elevations to the east. In the Engelmann spruce - subalpine fir zone, Abies pollen is characteristically more abundant than Picea, and notable percentages of NAP, especially Artemisia, occur. In the transition from Engelmann spruce - subalpine fir zone to montane spruce zone, Abies and Picea percentages are about equal or Picea predominates slightly, whereas in the montane spruce zone and sub-boreal pine spruce zones, Picea values exceed Abies values often four to five times. Percent pollen and spore versus percent taxon cover diagrams, despite widely spread values, reveal general relationships and background pollen rain values for major taxa valuable to the interpretation of fossil pollen assemblages. Pinus is greatly overrepresented with a regional background of 10-15%. At low to intermediate cover values, Tsuga heterophylla, Pseudotsuga, and Cupressaceae are represented more or less as they occur in the vegetation, with regional backgrounds up to 5%.

A coastal Pinus contorta paleobiome developed after glacier retreat under cool and probably dry climate. Cool moist forests involving Picea, Abies, Tsuga spp., and Pinus followed until the early Holocene. Pseudotsuga menziesii arrived and spread in the south 10 000-9000 BP, and Picea sitchensis - Tsuga heterophylla forests developed in the north. T. heterophylla increased 7500-7000 BP, and Cupressaceae expanded 5000-4000 BP. Bogs began to develop and expland. Modern vegetation arose 4000-2000 BP. There were early Holocene grass and Artemisia communities at mid-elevations and pine stands at high elevations in southern interior B.C. Forests expanded downslope and lakes formed 8500-7000 BP. Modern forests arose 4500-4000 BP while lower and upper tree lines declined. In northern B.C. non-arboreal communities preceded middle Holocene Picea forests. Abies, Pinus and Picea mariana predominated at various sites after 4000 BP. At 6000 BP Tsuga heterophylla (south) and Picea sitchensis (north) dominated the coast and islands and Quercus garryana and Pseudotsuga on southeast Vancouver Island, but Thuja plicata was infrequent. Southern Interior Plateau Vegetation at 6000 BP was more open than today at middle to lower elevations, whereas forests covered the Northern interior Plateau. Picea forests occurred in northern B.C. Holocene climate phases were : 1) warm dry ''xerothermic'' ca. 9500-7000 BP, 2) warm moist ''mesothermic'' ca. 7000-4500 BP, 3) moderate and moist 4500-0 BP, with increasing moisture 8500-6000 BP and cooling (?increased moisture) 4500-3000 BP. B.C.'s Hypsithermal had dry and wet stages; 6000 BP occurred in the warm and wet mesothermic stage.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;145 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;146 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayward, N</author><author>Calvert, AJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interpretation of structures in the southeastern Nechako Basin, British Columbia, from seismic reflection, well log, and potential field data</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1000-1020</pages><volume>48</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>NORTHWEST</keyword><keyword>COAST BELT</keyword><keyword>DEXTRAL STRIKE-SLIP</keyword><keyword>EOCENE</keyword><keyword>SKEENA FOLD BELT</keyword><keyword>THRUST SYSTEM</keyword><keyword>WESTERN UNITED-STATES</keyword><keyword>YALAKOM FAULT SYSTEM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E11-022</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The structure and stratigraphy of the southeast Nechako Basin, which are poorly understood primarily because of substantial volcanic cover, are investigated in an analysis of seismic reflection, well, and potential field data. Formation and development of the SE Nechako Basin resulted in sub-basins containing Cretaceous and Eocene rocks. Interpretation reveals that dextral transtension in the Early to Middle Eocene created NNW-trending, en echelon, strike-slip faults linked by pull-apart basins, which locally contain a thickness of Eocene volcaniclastic rocks of &gt;3 km. This structural pattern is consistent with regional observations that suggest the transfer of slip from the Yalakom fault to the north via a series of en echelon strike-slip faults. In the Middle to Late Eocene, faults associated with a change in the direction of stress, echoed by the north-trending right-lateral Fraser fault, reactivated and cut earlier structures. A simple model agrees with local observations, that northeast-directed compression was subparallel to the relic Cretaceous grain. Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous throughout the basin and may be remnants of a broader basin, or a number of contemporaneous basins, formed in a regional transpressional tectonic setting that caused northeast-directed thrusting along the eastern side of the Coast Plutonic Complex. Results suggest that thrusting affected most of the SE Nechako Basin, as observed across the Intermontane Belt to the northwest and southeast. The pattern of deposition of Neogene volcanic rocks of the Chilcotin Group was in part controlled by the Eocene structural grain, but we find no evidence of Neogene deformation.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;50</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hayward, N</author><author>Calvert, AJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Eocene and Neogene volcanic rocks in the southeastern Nechako Basin, British Columbia: interpretation of the Canadian Hunter seismic reflection surveys using first-arrival tomography</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>707-720</pages><volume>46</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>MAGMATISM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/E09-041</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Il est difficile d'effectuer une etude geologique a faible profondeur dans le sud-est du bassin de Nechako. La pietre qualite de l'imagerie de la sismique reflexion a faible profondeur est en partie due a la grande couverture par des roches volcaniques datant de l'Eocene et du Neogene. Les affleurements de ces roches volcaniques et du socle, datant principalement du Cretace, sont souvent caches par des depots du Quaternaire et de la vegetation. Les estimes de la vitesse de l'onde P a faible profondeur proviennent d'une inversion tomographique des premieres ondes arrivees, un outil efficace lorsque l'imagerie sismique est de faible qualite. Les vitesses du modele tomographique concordent avec la diagraphie sonique et les echantillons de laboratoire, sauf pour ceux provenant du Groupe de Chilcotin (Neogene). Des roches sedimentaires datant du Cretace ont des vitesses d'environ 2800-4200 ms(-1). Les roches des groupes de Endako et d'Ootsa Lake (Eocene), lesquelles ont des vitesses d'environ 3000-4200 ms(-1), ne peuvent pas etre differenciees en se basant sur les vitesses. La vitesse, le caractere (densite, foyer et profondeur de penetration) des rayons et les liens avec la geologie de surface et des puits limitent l'etendue sous la surface du Groupe d'Endako a proximite du puits b-82-C. Le Groupe de Chilcotin donne habituellement des vitesses (similar to 2400-3000 ms(-1)) inferieures aux vitesses correspondantes provenant de diagraphies soniques (4500-5200 ms(-1)) et de mesures en laboratoire (5000-5200 ms(-1)). Ces basses vitesses pour le modele peuvent etre causees par les roches brechiques a porosite elevee pres de la surface par rapport aux autres mesures qui ciblaient des laves massives a porosite moindre. Les vitesses moyennes les plus basses, situees au sud-est, sont reliees aux depots brechiques anormalement epais a porosite elevee du Groupe de Chilcotin. Cette conclusion concorde avec l'interpretation que le Groupe de Chilcotin est plus epais dans les vallees des anciennes rivieres.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Harvey, JE</author><author>Smith, DJ</author><author>Laxton, S</author><author>Desloges, J</author><author>Allen, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mid-Holocene glacier expansion between 7500 and 4000 cal. yr BP in the British Columbia Coast Mountains, Canada</title><secondary-title>HOLOCENE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HOLOCENE</full-title></periodical><pages>975-985</pages><volume>22</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>ADVANCE</keyword><keyword>BANFF-NATIONAL-PARK</keyword><keyword>Holocene</keyword><keyword>HOLOCENE</keyword><keyword>Coast Mountains</keyword><keyword>FLUCTUATIONS</keyword><keyword>APE LAKE</keyword><keyword>DENDROGLACIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE</keyword><keyword>dendroglaciology</keyword><keyword>Garibaldi</keyword><keyword>GARIBALDI-PROVINCIAL-PARK</keyword><keyword>glacier advances</keyword><keyword>NEOGLACIAL HISTORY</keyword><keyword>RIVER VALLEY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959-6836,1477-0911</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/0959683612437868</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The mid-Holocene behaviour of five glaciers in the British Columbia Coast Mountains was reconstructed from radiocarbon ages and stratigraphic analysis. Subfossil wood evidence at Canoe, Fyles, Jacobsen, Tchaikazan and Icemaker glaciers suggests these glaciers were expanding into standing forests prior to 6630, 4900 and 4200 cal. yr BP. Stratigraphically constrained woody detritus at Fyles Glacier records the progradational history of a Gilbert-type delta forming in response to glacial expansion between 7020 and 5470 cal. yr BP. This research provides the first evidence for mid-Holocene glacial expansion in the central and northern British Columbia Coast Mountains. Proxy records describing mid-Holocene climates in the British Columbia Coast Mountains indicate a trend towards slightly cooler and possibly wetter conditions than present. Glacial expansion occurring between 7500 and 4000 cal. yr BP has regional correlatives, suggesting coherent broad-scale climate forcing mechanisms influenced glacial mass balance at this time.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;62</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Generic">13</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartman, Gordon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"Water Release Facility at Kenney Dam Updated Conceptual Layout and Cost Estimate"</title></titles><keywords><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Natural Resources</keyword><keyword>Science and Technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>File consists of a copy of a Triton Environmental Consultants report prepared for the Nechako Environmental Enhancement Fund entitled "Kenney Dam Release Facility: Evaluation of the Effect of Operation of a Proposed Kenney Dam Water Release Facility on Cooling Water Releases and Nechako River Temperatures".</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://go.exlibris.link/8jg1XcY3</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Generic">13</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hartman, Gordon</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"Kenney Dam Release Facility: Evaluation of the Effect of Operation of a Proposed Kenney Dam Water Release Facility on Cooling Water Releases and Nechako River Temperatures"</title></titles><keywords><keyword>Environment</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Natural Resources</keyword><keyword>Science and Technology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>File consists of a copy of a Klohn-Crippen Consultants report prepared for the Nechako Environmental Enhancement Fund Management Committee entitled "Water Release Facility at Kenney Dam Updated Conceptual Layout and Cost Estimate".</abstract><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://go.exlibris.link/vVm7dZzk</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hart, SJ</author><author>Smith, DJ</author><author>Clague, JJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A multi-species dendroclimatic reconstruction of Chilko River streamflow, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>2752-2761</pages><volume>24</volume><number>19</number><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>RESPONSES</keyword><keyword>FLOW</keyword><keyword>MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>CLIMATIC VARIABILITY</keyword><keyword>SUB-ALPINE FIR</keyword><keyword>ELEVATION</keyword><keyword>VANCOUVER-ISLAND</keyword><keyword>Chilko River</keyword><keyword>Engelmann spruce</keyword><keyword>mountain hemlock</keyword><keyword>Pacific Decadal Oscillation</keyword><keyword>streamflow reconstruction</keyword><keyword>SUMMER TEMPERATURES</keyword><keyword>TELECONNECTIONS</keyword><keyword>TREE GROWTH</keyword><keyword>tree-ring</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087,1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.7674</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dendroclimatological data were used to reconstruct the discharge history of Chilko River, which drains a glacierized watershed in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia. We correlated ring-width records from Engelmann spruce (ES) (Picea engelmanni) and mountain hemlock (MH) (Tsuga mertensiana) trees to historical hydroclimate data. Over the period of record, spruce and hemlock radial growth correlates significantly with temperature and snow depth, respectively. We found that a multi-species approach provided a better model fit and reconstructive power. Using these relationships, we developed generalized linear models for mean June, July, and June-July discharge. The proxy records provide insights into streamflow variability of a typical Coast Mountains river over the past 240 years and confirm the long-term influence of the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on hydroclimatic regimes in the region. A relationship also exists between the reconstructed June-July discharge record and the North Pacific (NP) Index, suggesting that winter atmospheric patterns over the North Pacific influence the hydrology of coastal British Columbia.

As a model, we used three stocks of summer-run sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from the Fraser River watershed, British Columbia, to test the hypothesis that individual variation in migration speed is determined by a combination of environmental factors (i.e., water temperature), intrinsic biological differences (sex and population), and physiological and energetic condition. Before the freshwater portion of the migration, sockeye salmon (Quesnel, Chilcotin, and Nechako stock complexes) were captured in Johnstone Strait (similar to 215 km from river entry), gastrically implanted with radio transmitters, and sampled for blood, gill tissue, and energetic status before release. Analyses focused solely on individuals that successfully reached natal subwatersheds. Migration speeds were assessed by an extensive radiotelemetry array. Individuals from the stock complex that migrated the longest distance (Nechako) traveled at speeds slower than those of other stock complexes. Females traveled slower than males. An elevated energetic status of fish in the ocean was negatively correlated with migration speed in most river segments. During the transition from the ocean to the river, migration speed was negatively correlated with mean maximum water temperature; however, for the majority of river segments, it was positively correlated with migration speed. Physiological status measured in the ocean did not explain among-individual variability in river migration speeds. Collectively, these findings suggest that there could be extensive variation in migration behavior among individuals, sexes, and populations and that physiological condition in the ocean explained little of this variation relative to in-river environmental conditions and energetic status. Interestingly, individual fish generally retained their rank in swimming speed across different segments, except when transiting a challenging canyon midway during the migration.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;86</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Generic">13</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hannigan, Peter</author><author>Lee, P.

Situated at the University of Northern British Columbia in Prince George, the NMP created new opportunities, challenges, stresses and changes for the approximately 180 local specialists and family doctors. This study examines the initial impacts of the NMP on doctors practising in its host community. Methods Qualitative interview methods were used. A purposive sample was drawn from: (i) doctors who had involvement with the NMP, and (ii) doctors who were not involved with the NMP. Data were collected from May to September 2007 using a semi-structured interview guide. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and checked by participants. Analysis involved identifying, coding and categorising key emergent themes until saturation. Results Prior to the implementation of the NMP, doctors in Prince George had formed cohesive networks, in the face of adverse conditions, that functioned effectively as a form of social capital. The introduction of new doctors and resources through the NMP disrupted this sense of community cohesiveness. Over time, however, the NMP has created new mechanisms by which doctors interact and develop partnerships. Discussion The study confirms the value of a social capital framework for understanding a medical community's adaptation to change. At this early point, it appears the NMP has created new mechanisms by which doctors can interact and develop the partnerships and relationships necessary to renew a sense of community cohesion.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hanlon, N</author><author>Halseth, G</author><author>Snadden, D</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"We can see a future here": Place attachment, professional identity, and forms of capital mobilized to deliver medical education in an underserviced area</title><secondary-title>HEALTH &amp; PLACE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HEALTH &amp; PLACE</full-title></periodical><pages>909-915</pages><volume>16</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>COMMUNITY</keyword><keyword>Community-integrated medical education</keyword><keyword>DISTRIBUTED CAMPUS</keyword><keyword>Forms of capital</keyword><keyword>PERSPECTIVES</keyword><keyword>Place attachment</keyword><keyword>Professional identity</keyword><keyword>RECRUITMENT</keyword><keyword>RETENTION</keyword><keyword>SERVICE</keyword><keyword>Underserviced areas</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1353-8292,1873-2054</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.healthplace.2010.04.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Community-integrated undergraduate medical education is becoming a more common option for students predisposed to practice in rural and small town places One such initiative, the Northern Medical Program, has been operating since 2004 in the northern interior of British Columbia, Canada The NMP's curriculum relies heavily on the involvement of practicing physicians in its host community.

Setting: Kelowna, Prince George, Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Study design: Collaborative, qualitative methodology. Methods: Four focus groups were undertaken simultaneously with a total of 29 participants, comprising a purposive sample of men and women: 21 people with complete and incomplete SCI of high and low tetraplegia and paraplegia, 2 family members, 2 assistants and 4 occupational therapists. Interpretive analysis was grounded in the themes identified in the data. Results: Fatigue was perceived to have cognitive, emotional and physical dimensions and to exert a profound effect on the lives of many people with SCI, such that pleasurable activities were often eschewed to enable the accomplishment of more mundane tasks. Factors most consistently associated with fatigue were pain, depression and hopelessness, side effects of medications, poor quality sleep, spasticity, poor posture, diet, and the effort required to accomplish routine and self-care tasks. Conclusions: Fatigue is a complex phenomenon, interlinked with pain, depression and hopelessness that significantly diminishes the quality of life following SCI. Further research is required to provide greater understanding of this issue and to determine appropriate and comprehensive forms of intervention.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;48 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;49 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hak, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The socialist and labourist impulse in small-town British Columbia-Port Alberni and Prince George, 1911-33.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN HISTORICAL REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>519-542</pages><volume>70</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1989</year><pub-dates><date>1989</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3755</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3138/CHR-070-04-03</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gyug, LW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Status, distribution, and biology of the Mountain Beaver, Aplodontia rufa, in Canada</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN FIELD-NATURALIST</full-title></periodical><pages>476-490</pages><volume>114</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>Aplodontia rufa</keyword><keyword>distribution</keyword><keyword>habitat</keyword><keyword>Mountain Beaver</keyword><keyword>status</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3550</isbn><abstract>The distribution and status of the Mountain Beaver, Aplodontia rufa, in Canada is reviewed, based on museum specimens, published and unpublished sources, other collected observations, and on sign surveys conducted from 1996 to 1998 east of the Cascade Mountain divide. Biological information presented from the sign surveys includes densities of nest sites, habitat parameters, the diet based on plants found in haypiles outside nest sites, and the effects of clearcutting on Mountain Beaver. In Canada, Mountain Beavers are limited to extreme southwestern British Columbia because the Fraser River is an effective barrier to northward dispersal along the Coast Mountains, and because climates become too dry to support Mountain Beavers east and north of the Cascade Mountains. Typical habitat on the east side of the Cascade Mountains consists of sites with damp soils, often near streams, at elevations between 1200 and 1800 m. Principal summer food species found in haypiles within forests were Sitka Valerian (Valeriana sitchensis), Horsetail (Equisetum spp.), Twisted Stalk (Streptopus spp.), Thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), and Cow-parsnip (Heracleum lanatum). Narrow-leaved Fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) was the most common food in haypiles in clearcuts. Densities of underground nest sites in small (&lt; 2.5 ha) areas of high quality habitat reached up to 5.8 nests/ha. Densities over large areas where high habitat quality was relatively widespread averaged 35.3 nests/km(2). Where high quality habitat was not as widespread, densities averaged only 5.9 nests/km(2). Very low densities of 2 nests/km(2) were found where the heavy machinery associated with clearcutting and the site preparations for planting had severely disturbed the soil layer while 42 nests/km(2) were found where logging had been conducted in similar areas but without soil disturbance. The status of the Mountain Beaver in Canada is considered vulnerable because the range appears to be contracting in the lower Fraser River valley due to habitat lost to urbanization and agriculture, and because of its susceptibility to intensive forestry operations elsewhere in its range in Canada.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Groulx, M</author><author>Kieta, K</author><author>Rempel, M</author><author>Horning, D</author><author>Gaudreau, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Smart Growth in Canada's Provincial North</title><secondary-title>PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PLANNING PRACTICE AND RESEARCH</full-title></periodical><pages>231-247</pages><volume>37</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>SUSTAINABILITY</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>Growth management</keyword><keyword>LAND-USE</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT PROGRAMS</keyword><keyword>NEIGHBORHOOD</keyword><keyword>node</keyword><keyword>northern city</keyword><keyword>smart growth</keyword><keyword>SUBURBS CHALLENGES</keyword><keyword>urban planning</keyword><keyword>URBAN SPRAWL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0269-7459,1360-0583</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02697459.2021.1979786</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Smart growth promotes urban sustainability by encouraging increased densities, mixed use, walkable design, and access to diverse transportation and housing options.

(interior spruce) and Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. (subalpine fir)). Seed from populations of the three indigenous and co-occurring species was collected across an elevational transect on the southwestern slope of McBride Peak, near Prince George, BC. Collection sites were at elevations of 750 to 1850 m, the latter being close to the tree line. In 2003, seeds were germinated and seedlings raised under favorable growing conditions in a temperature controlled glasshouse. In 2004, seedlings of each population were grown in natural daylengths at a location within 50 km of the seed collection site both in a temperature-control led glasshouse and at a nearby field site, and height growth was recorded twice a week throughout the growing season. Species differed in both the date and the accumulated heat sum above 5 degrees C for the initiation and cessation of shoot extension. Growth durations (which integrate growth initiation and growth cessation) were more similar among species in the field than in the glasshouse. This suggests that different mechanisms of phenological control among co-occurring species can result in adaptive "equivalence" under a particular set of climatic conditions.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Grainger, S</author><author>Sherry, E</author><author>Fondahl, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The John Prince Research Forest: Evolution of a co-management partnership in northern British Columbia</title><secondary-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FORESTRY CHRONICLE</full-title></periodical><pages>484-495</pages><volume>82</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>FRAMEWORK</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal</keyword><keyword>ORGANIZATIONS</keyword><keyword>forest management</keyword><keyword>community forestry</keyword><keyword>LESSONS</keyword><keyword>co-management</keyword><keyword>COMMUNITY FORESTRY</keyword><keyword>CRITERIA</keyword><keyword>criteria and indicators (C&amp;I)</keyword><keyword>First Nation</keyword><keyword>FISHERIES COMANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>forest tenure</keyword><keyword>GOVERNMENT</keyword><keyword>joint venture</keyword><keyword>partnerships</keyword><keyword>research forest</keyword><keyword>RESOURCE</keyword><keyword>Tl'azt'en Nation</keyword><keyword>traditional environmental knowledge</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-7546,1499-9315</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5558/tfc82484-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The John Prince Research Forest (JPRF) was established as a co-managed forest between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, as an opportunity for these partners to blend their respective ways of understanding and managing forests to contribute to ecological and social sustainability Using four criteria of successful co-management reported in the literature as critical to the early stages of partnership - partnership building, institutional structure, decision-making, and capacity - we discuss the JPRF's performance during the first half-decade of its existence.

The new dates show that magmatism in the study area is partly coeval with that responsible for the Babine Igneous Suite - Newman Volcanic Suite (53-50 Ma) to the north, and for the Endako Group (51-45 Ma), which overlies the Ootsa Lake Group; however, locally the three magmatic suites are distinct in age and (or) the strata record a magmatic hiatus of as much as 7.5 million years. The ages generally young from north to south (52-47 Ma) along the western portion of the study area. The Babine Igneous Suite - Newman Volcanic Suite represents the oldest member of this series. However, in the east, the Ootsa Lake Group volcanic rocks are generally older (53-51 Ma). The anomalously older ages may be related to the interaction of magmatism and formation of a nearby and coeval core complex, which ongoing studies show was uplifted at about the same time during the Eocene. Felsic plutonism associated with the Ootsa Lake Group occurred between 50.5 and 47.3 Ma. These plutons were emplaced in an extensional setting along north-northeast-trending faults. The new dates, stratigraphic relationships, and suggested correlations of Eocene strata in the study area with that to the west and north require a revision of the stratigraphic nomenclature for the Ootsa Lake and Endako groups.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graf, M</author><author>Reid, ML</author><author>Aukema, BH</author><author>Lindgren, BS</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Association of tree diameter with body size and lipid content of mountain pine beetles</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN ENTOMOLOGIST</full-title></periodical><pages>467-477</pages><volume>144</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BARK BEETLES</keyword><keyword>COLEOPTERA-SCOLYTIDAE</keyword><keyword>DOUGLAS-FIR BEETLES</keyword><keyword>EMERGENCE</keyword><keyword>ENGRAVER BEETLES</keyword><keyword>FLIGHT BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>HOST SELECTION BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>INTRASPECIFIC COMPETITION</keyword><keyword>IPS-TYPOGRAPHUS</keyword><keyword>REPRODUCTION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-347X,1918-3240</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4039/tce.2012.38</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Host tree diameter is considered an important predictor of the population dynamics of the mountain pine beetle, Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae), but the relationship between host tree diameter and beetle traits is unclear. The primary objective of this study was to determine how the quality of individual mountain pine beetles, measured as body size (pronotum width) and lipid content, varied with the diameter of lodgepole pine trees, Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelmann (Pinaceae). Naturally attacked trees, ranging in diameter from 10 to 35 cm, were selected from stands near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada. Colonisation density and pupal density generally increased with tree diameter, but the number of pupal chambers per gallery start remained constant. Tree diameter positively affected beetle body size, which in turn was positively correlated with absolute lipid content in both sexes and relative lipid content in males. However, tree diameter did not directly predict absolute lipid content, and relative lipid content decreased with tree diameter in males. Larger beetles emerged earlier in the emergence period with relative lipid content remaining constant throughout emergence. All relationships had considerable unexplained variation. Thus, the use of tree diameter or emergence time as predictors of population dynamics of mountain pine beetles should be done with caution.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;35 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;59</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gottesfeld, LMJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of plant foods in traditional Wetsuweten nutrition</title><secondary-title>ECOLOGY OF FOOD AND NUTRITION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ECOLOGY OF FOOD AND NUTRITION</full-title></periodical><pages>149-169</pages><volume>34</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ABSORPTION</keyword><keyword>BRITISH COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>ECONOMIES</keyword><keyword>ETHNOBOTANY</keyword><keyword>FIBER</keyword><keyword>FORAGERS</keyword><keyword>INSULIN RESPONSES</keyword><keyword>IRON</keyword><keyword>NORTHWEST</keyword><keyword>NUTRITION</keyword><keyword>PLANT FOODS</keyword><keyword>PLASMA-GLUCOSE</keyword><keyword>PRODUCTS</keyword><keyword>TRADITIONAL DIET</keyword><keyword>WETSUWETEN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0367-0244</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/03670244.1995.9991456</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper investigates the role of plant foods in traditional diet of a northern foraging group, the Wet'suwet'en Indians of northwest British Columbia.

Plant foods were consumed throughout most or all of the year. Large quantities of plant foods, notably berries and fern rhizomes, were collected and stored for winter consumption. Critical contributions from plant foods included vitamin C, fibre, and carbohydrate to balance the consumption of protein in meat. Plant foods also made significant contributions to other nutrients, including iron, calcium and magnesium. The role of plant foods in folate nutrition is still unclear.

They live in a region of diverse topography, vegetation, and climate. Berry patch burning was the most important traditional vegetation manipulation. Black huckleberry and lowbush blueberry patches were burned to stimulate growth of new stems and production of berries, while preventing invasion by other shrub species and conifers. Maintenance of berry patches by burning was discontinued in the 1930s and 1940s because of fire suppression by the British Columbia Forest Service. Spring burning on south facing slopes, village sites, and garden sites was also practiced, and continues to the present. It occurs in aspen, pine, or grass dominated seral communities, or cottonwood floodplain forest, and is intended to control brush and encourage growth of grass.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;48 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;50 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gottesfeld, AS</author><author>Hassan, MA</author><author>Tunnicliffe, JF</author><author>Poirier, RW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sediment dispersion in salmon spawning streams: The influence of floods and salmon redd construction</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION</full-title></periodical><pages>1071-1086</pages><volume>40</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>sockeye salmon</keyword><keyword>bed load transport</keyword><keyword>bioturbation</keyword><keyword>erosion</keyword><keyword>forest hydrology</keyword><keyword>sedimentation</keyword><keyword>tracer studies</keyword><keyword>watershed management</keyword><keyword>COARSE PARTICLES</keyword><keyword>EGG BURIAL DEPTHS</keyword><keyword>FILL</keyword><keyword>GRAVEL BED STREAMS</keyword><keyword>SCOUR</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1093-474X,1752-1688</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1752-1688.2004.tb01068.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Magnetically tagged particles were used to investigate the effects of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) and floods on the dispersion of coarse bed material in the Stuart-Takla region, British Columbia, Canada. The dominant annual sediment transporting event in the channels is the snowmelt flood events, with lesser activity usually accomplished during summer floods. Annually in August, the channel bed material is reworked by the Early Stuart sockeye salmon spawning, as the fish excavate the streambed to deposit and bury their eggs. These nesting cavities are called redds. Results from 67 tracer recovery experiments over five years were highly variable, subject to the magnitude of floods and the returning population of salmon. Overall, the depositional pattern from nival flood events usually demonstrated a high degree of clast mobilization, long travel distances (up to 150 m), and mean depths of burial up to 18 cm. Summer flood events showed somewhat lower rates of mobilization, distances of travel, and depths of burial. Although the fish did not move the tracers very far, their effect on the bed was generally quite pervasive - up to 100 percent of the clasts were mobilized, and the depth of burial was considerable (mean burial depths up to 14 cm). The amount of vertical mixing of sediment by salmon was often on the same order of magnitude as flood events. The significant vertical mixing of sediments by the fish has important implications for the mobility of sediment in the stream. Since any armoring layer formed during high flows throughout the year is subject to the bioturbation of salmon, this suggests that the transport threshold in the creeks remains relatively low. Salmon likely play an integral role in the sediment transport. dynamics and annual sediment budget of the lower reaches of these creeks.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;63 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;63 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldie, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The 'Pulp Mill-An Anthology of Poems Prince-George BC- McKinnon, B</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN LITERATURE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN LITERATURE</full-title></periodical><pages>149-151</pages><number>93</number><issue>93</issue><dates><year>1982</year><pub-dates><date>1982</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4360</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Goldberg, MA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Knowledge creation, use and innovation: The role of urban and regional innovation strategies and policies</title><secondary-title>EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES</full-title></periodical><pages>641-664</pages><volume>14</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0965-4313,1469-5944</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/09654310500500171</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The paper discusses the creation, use and innovation of knowledge by focussing on Canadian urban and regional innovation strategies and policies.

Large-scale applications of habitat measures are planned to manage the risks caused to chinook salmon by potential reductions in habitat quality associated with the reduction of flows. The reduction of flows result from the planned diversion of an additional portion of the upper Nechako River drainage. Experimental placements of debris structures and channel modifications were conducted from 1988 to 1993. Juvenile chinook salmon highly colonized debris structures, particularly the sweepers and rail-debris catchers installed in 1991, and fry density was similar to sparse natural debris cover. Channel modifications, point bars, and a side channel were durable, but were not as well utilized by young chinook. Physical assessment indicated that durability was medium to high where debris catchers and bundles withstood peak flows of 250-283 m(3)/s.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;52</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gilbert, DE</author><author>Morris, JE</author><author>Kaveney, AR</author><author>Dery, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sub-hourly water temperature data collected across the Nechako Watershed, 2019-2021</title><secondary-title>DATA IN BRIEF</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>DATA IN BRIEF</full-title></periodical><volume>43</volume><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>Water temperature</keyword><keyword>Nechako Watershed</keyword><keyword>Northern British Columbia</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>Ecological impact</keyword><keyword>Heat waves</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2352-3409</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.dib.2022.108425</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Water temperature is actively being monitored along the regulated Nechako River and some of its unregulated tributaries in northern British Columbia (BC) to determine how climate variability, climate change and flow regulation influence water temperatures. The Nechako Watershed, located mainly in the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone, spans 47,200 km(2) in area [1]. The regional climate experiences a prominent seasonal cycle in air temperature and precipitation, with subfreezing temperatures and snow accumulating during winter. Waterways therefore experience extended near 0 degrees C water/ice temperatures during the winter season. The accumulation of snow yields snowmelt-generated peaks in discharge during the spring freshet period in unregulated tributaries [2]. Regional studies on climate reveal recent warming trends that are anticipated to persist through the 21st century, with a projected mean air temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C by the 2050's [3]. In response to warming air temperatures, regional water temperatures are also on the rise, with an average warming trend of 0.7 degrees C from 1950 to 2015 [4]. Changing water temperatures are important in understanding ecological and environmental impacts on riverine systems, including aquatic species such as fish (e.g., sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), all endemic species to the Nechako Watershed), invertebrates, and microorganisms. Managing water temperatures during the fish spawning season is crucial as elevated temperatures induce stress and affect reproduction success [5]. Starting with a pilot project in summer of 2019, we expanded in situ monitoring of water temperature to 29 sites; however, for the purposes of this paper, only data from 24 sites are included (some sites have limited data samples or loggers could not be retrieved in the field). Currently, 25 sites are fully operational and collecting data, all deployed to sample and record data at 15-minute intervals starting at the top of the hour. Site data collection occurs at minimum once annually (typically during summer/early fall), along with site and logger maintenance. Field notes are taken to identify any potential issues with data collection, such as loggers dewatering during low flows, duration of logger removal for data collection, and any other environmental concerns that should later be considered during data analysis. The assembled data are useful to build long-term time series of observed water temperatures within the Nechako Watershed and as a baseline for future projects. The data are also used to determine the effectiveness of the Summer Temperature Management Program at the Nechako Reservoir and Skins Lake Spillway [1]. Therefore, these data can be used in the future to better identify the optimal discharge from the reservoir to minimize ecological effects on the watershed. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

The Pinchi Fault separates rocks of contrasting geological histories, and the blueschists and eclogites occur with ultramafic rocks as fault-bounded blocks. The retrogressed eclogites occur as tectonic blocks, now in glacial debris, a few metres across; blueschists occur in coherent kilometre-sized tracts. Eclogites contain garnet-omphacite-rutile-quartz, with glaucophane, lawsonite and titanite. Some of the lawsonite appears to be stable with omphacite and garnet. Tectonic blocks of eclogite from two different localities have recorded different P-T histories. In one tectonic block, P-T estimates for garnet inclusions in clinopyroxene and lawsonite (c. 565-degrees-C, &gt; 13.1 kbar) suggest that garnet and omphacite initially equilibrated outside the stability field of lawsonite. A decrease in temperature, as recorded in garnet rims and matrix clinopyroxene, resulted in crystallization of lawsonite and other retrogressive minerals. Later crystallization of stilpnomelane (locally pseudomorphing garnet), howieite, winchite and actinolite was triggered by an ir-flux of fluid under P-T conditions outside the stability field of garnet. Lawsonite appears to have been stable, suggesting a minimum pressure of about 3 kbar. In the second tectonic block, clinopyroxene inclusions in garnet suggest temperatures near 350-degrees-C (P &gt; 10 kbar) and garnet rims equilibrated with matrix clinopyroxene suggest temperatures near 450-degrees-C at pressures above c. 12 kbar.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;39 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;41 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghent, ED</author><author>Stout, MZ</author><author>Erdmer, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Howieite in blueschists, Pinchi Lake, British-Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN MINERALOGIST</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN MINERALOGIST</full-title></periodical><pages>855-858</pages><volume>28</volume><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>BLUESCHISTS</keyword><keyword>PINCHI LAKE</keyword><keyword>STABILITY</keyword><keyword>DEERITE</keyword><keyword>FACIES MINERALS</keyword><keyword>HOWIEITE</keyword><keyword>STILPNOMELANE</keyword><keyword>WINCHITE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4476</isbn><abstract>Lawsonite blueschist boulders from the Pinchi Fault Zone, British Columbia, locally contain howieite, stilpnomelane, and Na-Ca-amphiboles.

Blueschists (in situ) and retrogressed eclogite blocks occur along the Pinchi fault zone near 54 degrees 30'N and 124 degrees W. Critical blueschist facies mineral assemblages include lawsonite-glaucophane, jadeite-lawsonite-glaucophane-quartz, and aragonite. White mica 40Ar/39Ar spectra on blueschist and eclogite yield ages in the range 221.8 +/- 1.9 to 223.5 +/- 1.7 Ma, establishing a direct link between the blueschists and eclogites. Preservation of aragonite sets rigid constraints on the pressure-temperature-fluid-time conditions of unroofing. K-Ar dates indicate that this is some of the oldest documented metamorphic aragonite. Comparison with computed petrogenetic grids suggests that-metamorphic temperatures were in the range 200-300 degrees C, with pressures greater than 8-10 kbar (1 kbar = 100 MPa). Unroofing likely occurred during collision of the Cache Creek terrane with Quesnellia in the Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic. The fault was initiated as a plate boundary and was active as late as Eocene time as a strike-slip zone. The Pinchi blueschist terrane is similar to others in the North American Cordillera and highlights a tectonic regime of repeated blueschist metamorphism and rapid unroofing along many parts of the western margin of North America in the early Mesozoic.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghent, E</author><author>Tinkham, D</author><author>Marr, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Lawsonite eclogites from the Pinchi Lake area, British Columbia-new P-T estimates and interpretation</title><secondary-title>LITHOS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>LITHOS</full-title></periodical><pages>248-253</pages><volume>109</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>PRESSURE-TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>Canadian Cordillera</keyword><keyword>Geothermobarometry</keyword><keyword>Lawsonite eclogite</keyword><keyword>METAMORPHISM</keyword><keyword>OCEANIC-CRUST</keyword><keyword>SIVRIHISAR</keyword><keyword>SUBDUCTION</keyword><keyword>Very high pressure metamorphism</keyword><keyword>XENOLITHS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0024-4937,1872-6143</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.lithos.2008.06.018</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Lawsonite eclogites from Pinchi Lake, British Columbia. occur as tectonic blocks associated with lawsonite, aragonite, and jadeite-bearing blueschists. One tectonic block from Tezzeron Lake shows extensive lower-temperature retrogression. The block from Beaver Lake Road (BLR) shows less retrogression and the garnet crystals contain abundant inclusions of lawsonite and omphacite suggesting these minerals were stable throughout most of the crystallization history. Compositional profiles and element maps of garnets show: (1) Mn enrichment in cores with decrease toward rims; (2) little change in Ca from core to rim: (3) general decrease in Fe/Mg from Core to rim. Phase diagram sections for sample BLR-3 and garnet-core compositions suggest garnet-core growth at 505 degrees C and 24.3 kbar (1 kbar = 0.1 GPa). Temperature estimates based upon garnet-clinopyroxene Fe-Mg exchange geothermometry are, for inclusions in garnet at 25 kbar, 450 +/- 30 degrees C (4 spots); 435 +/- 15 (10); and 445 +/- 25 (6). For garnet rims and matrix clinopyroxene the results are: 515 +/- 50 degrees C (2): 440 +/- 25 (5); 475 +/- 20 (2). These results suggest very little if any statistically significant changes in temperature during crystal growth. Estimates of pressure are based upon several different calibrations of the garnet-clinopyroxene-phengite equilibria. Using the calibration of Krogh-Ravna we obtain pressures of: 24.2-26.8 kbar, compatible with that estimated for garnet-core growth in BLR-3. For the glaucophane = talc + jadeite geobarometer. the activity relations for glaucophane are not well constrained. At 450 degrees C a pressure of 26 kbar is calculated (one sample). A pressure of 25 kbarat 450 degrees C suggests depths of similar to 90 km, leading to a P-T gradient of similar to 5 degrees C km(-1). This gradient passes through the inferred stability field of lawsonite eclogites and the calculated stability fields of lawsonite for Pinchi Lake samples. This is very near the P-T stability field of coesite, which is characteristic of Ultra-High-Pressure metamorphism. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Colonial legal regimes situate indigeneity as a condition of temporal stasis, perpetuating the logic of territorial dispossession and erasure. Drawing on research in India and Canada, we focus on Indigenous experiences to theorize the relationship between colonial legal regimes, territory, temporality, and infrastructure. In the Indigenous territories of the Lepchas in the Indian Himalaya and the Dakelh in British Columbia, Canada, hydropower infrastructure effected displacements of Indigenous space-times and sovereignty. Although Indigenous peoples continue to assert legal claims challenging these massive infrastructural projects, colonial legal regimes normalize the often violent imposition of the space-times of state and capitalist development. The Dakelh have challenged the enduring impacts of a 1950s river diversion project; however, Canadian courts legitimized historic displacements, delimiting constitutional protections to current existing Dakelh rights. For the Lepchas, a recent infrastructural boom in the Indian Himalaya is threatening special constitutional provisions upholding tribal customary laws, raising concern among younger Lepchas over the future of their ancestral lands. Despite these threats, we demonstrate how Lepcha and Dakelh relations to time and territory exceed colonial containments. They call into question how the colonial present normalizes historic and ongoing displacements and demand responsibility for the past to craft alternative futures.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gateuille, D</author><author>Owens, PN</author><author>Petticrew, EL</author><author>Booth, BP</author><author>French, TD</author><author>Dery, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determining contemporary and historical sediment sources in a large drainage basin impacted by cumulative effects: the regulated Nechako River, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</full-title></periodical><pages>3357-3373</pages><volume>19</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>CONSTRAINTS</keyword><keyword>SUSPENDED SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>CATCHMENT</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>EROSION</keyword><keyword>FALLOUT</keyword><keyword>Land-use changes</keyword><keyword>MixSIAR</keyword><keyword>Nechako white sturgeon</keyword><keyword>PARTICLE-SIZE</keyword><keyword>Reservoir management</keyword><keyword>Sediment fingerprinting</keyword><keyword>SOIL</keyword><keyword>SOURCE FINGERPRINTING INVESTIGATIONS</keyword><keyword>WATERSHEDS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1439-0108,1614-7480</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11368-019-02299-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Purpose Sediment dynamics in most large river basins are influenced by a variety of different natural and anthropogenic pressures, and disentangling these cumulative effects remains a challenge. This study determined the contemporary and historical sources of fine-grained (&lt; 63-mu m) sediment in a large, regulated river basin and linked changes in sources to activities in the basin. The river has seen declines in chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, and the endangered Nechako white sturgeon populations, and sediment (both fine-grained and sands) transport and deposition have been identified as potential causes of these declines. Materials and methods Samples of suspended sediment and potential source materials were collected from numerous sites distributed throughout the upper Nechako River Basin in British Columbia, Canada. A floodplain sediment core was also collected in order to reconstruct sediment sources over the last similar to 70 years. Discriminating fingerprint properties were used within the MixSIAR model to apportion sources among sub-basins and land-use types. Results were compared to records of precipitation and Nechako River discharge trends, and to changes in landscape development. Results and discussion Contributions from the erosion of channel banks dominated the suspended sediment load at most sites. Changes in sediment sources during the 2015 field season reflected snowmelt and patterns of water release from the Nechako Reservoir that affected the sediment-carrying capacity of tributaries and the Nechako River main stem. Spatial variations in 2015 also reflected the distribution of land use (e.g., forested or agricultural land) as well as topography (e.g., slope steepness). Over the last similar to 70 years, variations in sediment sources and the characteristics of the sediment (e.g., organic matter content and particle size composition) were linked to the construction of the Kenney Dam (operational in 1954) and the impacts of deforestation by the forestry and agricultural industries. Superimposed on these have been wildfires and a major mountain pine beetle infestation leading to higher erosion rates in the affected areas. Conclusions The sediment source fingerprinting technique, in combination with historical information on the hydrometeorology and the land use and river management in the basin, has provided valuable information with which to understand sediment dynamics in the Nechako River Basin. Such an approach can help to disentangle how large river systems respond to a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;67</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Galway, LP</author><author>Beery, T</author><author>Buse, C</author><author>Gislason, MK</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>What Drives Climate Action in Canada's Provincial North?

This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the role of connectedness to nature in promoting individual-level climate action in a unique setting where climate research and action are lacking: Canada's Provincial North. To begin to understand possible pathways, we also examined whether climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and climate action. We used data collected via postal surveys in two Provincial North communities, Thunder Bay (Ontario), and Prince George (British Columbia) (n = 628). Results show that connectedness to nature has a direct positive association with individual-level climate action, controlling for gender and education. Results of parallel mediation analyses further show that connectedness to nature is indirectly associated with individual-level climate action, mediated by both climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends. Finally, results suggest that climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends serially mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and with individual-level climate action. These findings are relevant for climate change engagement and action, especially across Canada's Provincial North, but also in similar settings characterized by marginalization, heightened vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. Drawing on these findings, we argue that cultivating stronger connections with nature in the places where people live, learn, work, and play is an important and currently underutilized leverage point for promoting individual-level climate action. This study therefore adds to the current and increasingly relevant calls for (re-)connecting with nature that have been made by others across a range of disciplinary and sectoral divides.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;119</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Galway, LP</author><author>Beery, T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring Climate Emotions in Canada's Provincial North</title><secondary-title>FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><keywords><keyword>climate change</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>PERCEPTIONS</keyword><keyword>POLICY SUPPORT</keyword><keyword>ANXIETY</keyword><keyword>climate anxiety</keyword><keyword>climate emotion scale (CES)</keyword><keyword>climate emotions</keyword><keyword>emotion</keyword><keyword>HOPE</keyword><keyword>Northern</keyword><keyword>NUNATSIAVUT</keyword><keyword>PLACE</keyword><keyword>Provincial North</keyword><keyword>SENSE</keyword><keyword>WORRY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1664-1078</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fpsyg.2022.920313</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The mental and emotional dimensions of climate change are increasingly concerning as extreme events become more frequent and severe, ecosystem destruction advances, and people become more aware of climate impacts and injustices. Research on climate emotions has rapidly advanced over the last decade with growing evidence illustrating that climate emotions can impact health, shape climate action, and ought to be considered in climate change communication, education, and engagement. This paper explores, describes, and discusses climate emotions in the context of Canada's Provincial North: a vast region characterized by a vulnerability to climate change, remoteness, political marginalization, diverse Indigenous populations, and economies/livelihoods tied to resource extraction. Using postal survey data collected in two Provincial North communities (Thunder Bay, Ontario, and Prince George, British Columbia; N = 627), we aim to (1) describe climate emotions experienced in the context of Canada's Provincial North, including relationships among specific emotions; and (2) examine if socio-demographic variables (gender, age, and parenthood) show a relationship with climate emotions. Results show high levels of emotional response to climate change overall, with worry and frustration as those emotions reported by the highest percentage of participants. We also find significant difference in climate emotions between men and women. A methodological result was noted in the usefulness of the Climate Emotion Scale (CES), which showed high reliability and high inter-item correlation. A notable limitation of our data is its' underrepresentation of Indigenous peoples. The findings contribute to a greater understanding of climate emotions with relevance to similar settings characterized by marginalization, vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. We discuss our findings in relation to the literature and outline future research directions and implications.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;69</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gallant, Laurie</author><author>Taschereau, Denise</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Thinking out of the blue box: Community-based enterprises lead the way to meaningful local jobs in an emerging green economy</title><secondary-title>Alternatives Journal</secondary-title><short-title>THINKING OUT OF THE BLUE BOX</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Alternatives Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>23-24</pages><volume>27</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Environmental aspects</keyword><keyword>economic development</keyword><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword><keyword>Social Sciences: Comprehensive Works</keyword><keyword>Community development</keyword><keyword>Employment</keyword><keyword>environment</keyword><keyword>Environmental Studies</keyword><keyword>Industry</keyword><keyword>Recycling</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>12057398</isbn><abstract>In the northern interior of BC, the town of Smithers' new garbage collection bylaw will make it illegal as of January 1, 2001, to put any product stewardship items, such as used beverage containers and old paint, into the local landfill. The bylaw also bans old corrugated cardboard, grass clippings, leaves and clean wood waste. The bylaw includes a new and visionary definition of garbage as "any material that has no economic value to a local enterprise." Farrow adds, though, that this strategy would be much more effective if the regional government would impose tipping fees at the landfill. Unlike many regional governments for rural Canadian communities, the regional district of Bulkley-Nechako doesn't charge fees to dump at its landfill. "Without the tipping fees we have no financial incentive to reduce waste, even though we recognize our social and environmental responsibility to do so. We could easily reduce our annual expenditure on waste disposal costs by one quarter if there were tipping fees ... and that would free up money for recycling and education initiatives." Our "take, make and waste" economy will pose challenges for R-CED. The prevailing wisdom remains to throw things "away" and many manufacturers are happy with the status quo, which dumps the responsibility for waste management on taxpayers.</abstract><remote-database-name>ProQuest</remote-database-name><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://search.proquest.com/cbcacurrent/docview/218752365/abstract/64809FD44D6649FDPQ/289?</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2015-09-10 21:33:20</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Friedman, RM</author><author>Diakow, LJ</author><author>Lane, RA</author><author>Mortensen, JK</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>New U-Pb age constraints on latest Cretaceous magmatism and associated mineralization in the Fawnie Range, Nechako Plateau, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>619-637</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>GEOCHRONOLOGY</keyword><keyword>ALASKA</keyword><keyword>SUBDUCTION</keyword><keyword>YUKON</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-122</electronic-resource-num><abstract>New U-Pb ages and K-Ar dates, primarily for rocks proximal to mineral occurrences in the Fawnie Range of central British Columbia, document latest Cretaceous (ca. 74-66 Ma) continental-arc igneous activity and date associated base and precious metal mineralization. U-Pb ages of ca. 73-69 Ma for the Capoose pluton and hypabyssal to extrusive garnet rhyolites at the Capoose prospect demonstrate a latest Cretaceous age for mineralization and a likely plutonic source for mineralizing fluids. A U-Pb age of ca. 67 Ma for a late mineralized felsic dyke and two K-Ar dates (ca. 70 and 68 Ma) for hornfelsed Jurassic volcanic rocks at the Blackwater-Davidson prospect constrain a latest Cretaceous age for mineralization. A U-Pb age of ca. 74 Ma for a fine grained diorite sill that cuts a significant epithermal gold vein at the Tsacha prospect places a minimum age on mineralization at this probable Jura-Cretaceous deposit and documents latest Cretaceous magmatism. Latest Cretaceous K-Ar dates are reported for an andesite flow adjacent to the Eocene Holy Cross deposit (ca. 66 Ma), about 35 km north of the Fawnie Range, and a Kasalka Group rhyolite (ca. 68 Ma) exposed near the western margin of the Nechako Plateau. Latest Cretaceous magmatism and mineralization in the Fawnie Range represent the waning stages of Bulkley suite magmatism and porphyry-style mineralization, which was concentrated along the western margin of the Nechako Plateau at circa 88-70 Ma. The distribution of latest Cretaceous arc igneous rocks along the North American Cordilleran is reviewed and tectonic implications discussed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;62</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>French, TD</author><author>Petticrew, EL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chlorophyll a seasonality in four shallow eutrophic lakes (northern British Columbia, Canada) and the critical roles of internal phosphorus loading and temperature</title><secondary-title>HYDROBIOLOGIA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROBIOLOGIA</full-title></periodical><pages>285-299</pages><volume>575</volume><keywords><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>SEDIMENTS</keyword><keyword>FOOD-WEB</keyword><keyword>WESTERN CANADA</keyword><keyword>algae</keyword><keyword>algal blooms</keyword><keyword>ARCTIC LAKES</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>CYANOBACTERIAL TOXINS</keyword><keyword>eutrophication</keyword><keyword>GREAT-LAKES</keyword><keyword>nutrients</keyword><keyword>pH</keyword><keyword>PH</keyword><keyword>phytoplankton</keyword><keyword>PHYTOPLANKTON</keyword><keyword>SHAGAWA LAKE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0018-8158</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10750-006-0377-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Chlorophyll a (Chl a) seasonality was investigated in four shallow eutrophic lakes located in north-central British Columbia (western Canada). Chlorophyll a concentration maxima in all four lakes occurred during the late summer/early autumn when near-surface total phosphorus ([Tot-P]) and total dissolved P concentrations, pH, and water temperature were highest. Mass balance and inferential analyses showed that bloom-triggering P loads came mostly from within-lake sources, but that mechanisms controlling internal loading in Charlie and Tabor (lakes having hypolimnetic oxygen deficits during summer) were fundamentally different than those in Nulki and Tachick (isothermal, well oxygenated lakes). Although the timing and intensity of major blooms were associated with late summer/early autumn P loads, average summer [Chl a] were predicted well by previously developed models based solely on spring overturn [Tot-P]. Instantaneous within-lake [Chl a] were best predicted by models incorporating both surface [Tot-P] and temperature (r(2) = 0.57-0.70). Moreover, [Tot-P] and temperature combined accounted for 57% of among-lake variations in instantaneous [Chl a]: log [Chl a] = 0.038 (degrees C) + 0.006 ([Tot-P]) + 0.203 (P &lt; 0.001), where [Chl a] and [Tot-P] are in mu g l(-1). Positive associations between instantaneous [Chl a] and temperature support climate change models that forecast changes in phytoplankton productivity even if nutrient loading rates remain constant.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>French, TD</author><author>Chambers, PA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reducing flows in the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada): potential response of the macrophyte community</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>2247-2254</pages><volume>54</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>VEGETATION</keyword><keyword>DOWNSTREAM</keyword><keyword>CLOSURE</keyword><keyword>DAMS</keyword><keyword>FAUNA</keyword><keyword>IMPOUNDMENTS</keyword><keyword>RESERVOIR</keyword><keyword>SECTIONS</keyword><keyword>STREAM</keyword><keyword>TEES</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0706-652X,1205-7533</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfas-54-10-2247</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Approximately 50% of the Nechako River's flow was permanently diverted into another watershed in the early 1950s. Up to 50% of the remaining flow may be diverted in the future. To give insight as to how future and past flow reductions will/have affect(ed) macrophyte abundance, we first developed equations relating average summer channel speed to cross-sectional biomass and bottom cover from data collected at 26 sites. The average summer channel speed at each site was then estimated assuming flows (at Fort Fraser) of 408 m(3).s(-1) (natural), 165 m(3).s(-1) (1952-1990 average), and two future scenarios: 120 and 60 m(3).s(-1). We then used these estimates in our equations to compute abundance under the various flow regimes. Our models suggest that flow has Little influence on macrophyte abundance in two fast-flowing reaches, which together account for 50% of the river's length. In contrast, the diversion was predicted to have increased biomass and cover by, on average, 66 g.m(-2) and 15%, respectively, in a slow-flowing reach accounting for 20% of the river's length. Biomass and cover in this reach could increase by an additional 65 g.m(-2) (or 240 g.m(-2)) and 9% (or 29%) if flows are reduced to 120 m(3).s(-1) (or 60 m(3).s(-1)).</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;48</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freeman, S</author><author>Martin, J</author><author>Nash, C</author><author>Hausknecht, S</author><author>Skinner, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Use of a Digital Storytelling Workshop to Foster Development of Intergenerational Relationships and Preserve Culture with the Nak'azdli First Nation: Findings from the Nak'azdli Lha'hutit'en Project</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL ON AGING-REVUE CANADIENNE DU VIEILLISSEMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>284-293</pages><volume>39</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>aging</keyword><keyword>Indigenous population</keyword><keyword>adolescent</keyword><keyword>aged</keyword><keyword>community based participatory research</keyword><keyword>digital story</keyword><keyword>Indigenous knowledge</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0714-9808,1710-1107</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1017/S0714980819000588</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Nak'azdli Whut'en, a First Nations community in northern British Columbia, recognized the importance of preserving Elders' wisdom and sharing cultural knowledge and oral traditions across generations. We report learnings from an intergenerational digital storytelling workshop led by the Nak'azdli Health Centre in partnership with community organizations and academic partners. Framed by a participatory action design in accordance with the Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession (OCAP(R)) principles, a 10 session workshop was created and piloted. WeVideo technology was used to facilitate knowledge sharing between elementary school students and Elders. Through storytelling, the Elders shared their wisdom and knowledge. The students recorded the stories and added imagery and sounds to capture their understandings in a digital format. Thus, Elders and students worked in partnership to co-create digital stories to create a cultural legacy for future generations. This workshop aligned with the British Columbia school curriculum, fostered intergenerational relationships between Elders and youth, helped preserve cultural identity, and facilitated opportunity for meaningful contribution for Elders and youth to their community.

Aboriginal tourism is one of these industries, often described as a development opportunity which may promote Aboriginal peoples' cultural revitalization and economic benefits without exploiting their traditional territories. While documentation of demand for Aboriginal tourism experiences in North America exists, visitor product preferences remain largely unknown. However, Aboriginal tourism business entrepreneurs and operators need this information in order to manage for the long-term profitability of their businesses. The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities. In the end, which segment to target and which marketing channels to use will depend on Tl'azt'en and other First Nations' level of comfort in interacting with visitors and how much of their culture they are willing to share with touris</abstract><remote-database-name>arcabc.ca</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A6911/</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2016-09-01 23:33:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Parker, Eleanor</author><author>Parkes, Margot</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Linking school based monitoring to land and water decision-making in the Nechako watershed</title></titles><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of Northern British Columbia</publisher><work-type>Master of Science</work-type><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A59309</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/ahmadjalil/Zotero/storage/6L6KLQCM/Parker - 2022 - Linking school based monitoring to land and water .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-23 21:44:49</access-date><misc2>Master of Science</misc2></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nowak, Nadia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"It’s our law to protect the land and the people": Perspectives on traditional governance and Keyoh stewardship with S̲aik’uz̲ Whut’enne</title><short-title>"It’s our law to protect the land and the people"</short-title></titles><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of Northern British Columbia</publisher><work-type>Master of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies</work-type><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A59273</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-23 21:44:07</access-date><misc2>Master of Natural Resources and Environmental Studies</misc2></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hewitt, Kate</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring Indigenous-led collaborative stewardship in a watershed context: Prespectives from the Nechako headwaters</title><short-title>Exploring Indigenous-led collaborative stewardship in a watershed context</short-title></titles><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of Northern British Columbia</publisher><work-type>Master of Science</work-type><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A59016</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/ahmadjalil/Zotero/storage/5N9FKV4L/Hewitt - 2019 - Exploring Indigenous-led collaborative stewardship.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-23 21:43:46</access-date><misc2>Master of Science</misc2></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gothreau, Joseph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring climate change, ecosystems and well-being connections: lessons learned from the application of a geospatial knowledge exchange tool in the Nechako watershed</title><short-title>Exploring climate change, ecosystems and well-being connections</short-title></titles><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of Northern British Columbia</publisher><abstract>The Nechako Watershed is a large system in northern BC that exemplifies the challenge of integrating information across climate, environment and well-being. This research responded to this need with the goal of enhancing how information about the Nechako Watershed is communicated and shared. Informed by the development of a geospatial ‘portal’ tool in northern BC, this research sought to establish the Integrated Watershed Research Group (IWRG) Portal, gain insight on establishing accessible knowledge exchange strategies, and identify its perceived benefits and limitations. The research had two phases. Phase I involved working with a development team to understand this tool, testing, establishing the IWRG Portal, finding and formatting content. Phase II brought members of the Portal User Research Group together to further refine the IWRG Portal and content through scoping discussions, workshops, and a focus group. Thematic analysis was used to code and analyze the transcribed focus group. The research identified benefits of the portal with how it dealt with complexity and its integrative features. Limitations were also found, including the need for intentional framing of data, a steep learning curve, and the need for an internet connection. Analysis also identified the need to tailor content for specific audiences. The research has shown that tools such as the IWRG Portal can create new pathways to understanding and finding information. The research has also identified paths for further refinement and development of the portal tool by expanding the user base and continuing to evaluate the effectiveness of this tool in various contexts.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A59213</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/ahmadjalil/Zotero/storage/V87GJ3NI/Gothreau - 2021 - Exploring climate change, ecosystems and well-bein.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-23 21:42:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Beck, Lindsay Nicole</author><author>Parks, Margot</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Connections between land and wellbeing: Perspectives of First Nations youth in the community of Saik'uz.</title><short-title>Connections between land and wellbeing</short-title></titles><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of Northern British Columbia</publisher><work-type>Master of Science</work-type><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://unbc.arcabc.ca/islandora/object/unbc%3A16893</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/ahmadjalil/Zotero/storage/V32CQ5WV/Beck - 2013 - Connections between land and wellbeing Perspectiv.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-23 21:41:15</access-date><misc2>Master of Science</misc2></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>White, Wm.

A stable primary remanent magnetization of both normal and reversed polarity was isolated after a.f. demagnetization in 19 of 22 sites (109 cores; 208 specimens) representing several of the plutonic units present in this sialic complex of quartz monzonite affinity near Endako, B.C. The unit mean remanence directions support some petrological correlations suggested by Carr, Bright, and White et al., but do not support others. The pole position derived from 13 sites representing 6 plutonic units with a K–Ar radiomelric age of 139 ± 4 m.y. (White et al.) is 128.6 °E, 70.0 °N(δm = 14.4°; δp = 11.4°).

Between these regions a complex fault system involves a series of elongate fault-bounded blocks of contrasting lithology and metamorphic grade. These blocks consist of: (a) highly deformed aragonite–dolomite limestone and blueschist, (b) pumpellyite–aragonite greenstone, (c) a harzburgite–gabbro–diabase–basalt ophiolite sequence, (d) serpentinized alpine ultramafite, and (e) Cretaceous (?) conglomerate. The blueschist probably formed at 8–12 kbar (8 × 105–12 × 105 kPa) and 225–325 °C during a penetrative early deformation which was closely followed by a later deformation associated with a Late Triassic uplift and cooling event.

As redefined herein, it consists of three formations in the McConnell Creek map-area. Lowest is the Dewar Formation, composed of argillite and volcanic sandstone that is largely the distal equivalent of basic flows and coarse volcaniclastic rocks of the Savage Mountain Formation. These formations are overlain by the volcaniclastic, basic to intermediate Moosevale Formation. These rocks are Upper Triassic (upper Karnian and lower Norian). They are unconformably overlain by Lower Jurassic rocks of the Hazelton Group., Le groupe de Takla, dans le centre nord de la Colombie-Britannique, dans sa définition originale comprenait des roches volcaniques et sédimentaires datant du Trias supérieur et duJurassique.

Organic-rich lake sediment samples were collected towards the centre of approximately 500 lakes on a helicopter-assisted survey covering some 16,000 km2. Lakes overlying each of five major lithologies contain a distinctive suite of trace metals. Regional variations of Cu, Mo, Pb, Zn, Ni, Cr, Sr, Ba, Ag, Co, V and Ga can be related to differences in underlying geology. In addition, levels of Cu, Mo, Pb and Zn which exceed their regional thresholds are related to mineralization or lithologies favourable to mineralization. Although metal concentrations within a lake may vary up to 12x, anomalous conditions are not masked by this variability and the survey outlined all major sulphide occurrences known in the region.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21</research-notes><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0375674276900388</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2017-01-10 18:16:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Perzyna, M</author><author>Bauder, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Threats from within and threats from without: wet'suwet'en protesters, irregular asylum seekers and on-going settler colonialism in Canada</title><secondary-title>SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>SETTLER COLONIAL STUDIES</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>RISK</keyword><keyword>asylum</keyword><keyword>CITIZENSHIP</keyword><keyword>CRIMINALIZATION</keyword><keyword>discourse</keyword><keyword>DISCOURSE</keyword><keyword>IMMIGRANTS</keyword><keyword>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</keyword><keyword>irregular</keyword><keyword>MEDIA</keyword><keyword>media framing</keyword><keyword>MIGRATION</keyword><keyword>protest</keyword><keyword>race and racism</keyword><keyword>refugees</keyword><keyword>Safe Third Country Agreement</keyword><keyword>securitization</keyword><keyword>settler colonialism</keyword><keyword>SOCIETY</keyword><keyword>SOVEREIGNTY</keyword><keyword>Wet'suwet'en</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2201-473X,1838-0743</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/2201473X.2022.2030083</electronic-resource-num><abstract>This paper addresses the 'immigrant-Aboriginal parallax gap' whereby material connections between immigration and Indigenous dispossession are rarely examined in tandem by considering ways in which the Canadian media frames Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers. Building on the work of previous studies of Oka/Kanasatake, Ipperwash and Caledonia and irregular boat arrivals of Fujian and Tamil asylum seekers, it identifies similarities in the ways that each group has been racialized, criminalized, delegitimized and constructed as the 'Other'. Employing the theoretical frameworks of settler colonialism and securitization theory, it examines whether the same frames persist in contemporary representations using the case studies of Wet'suwet'en protesters and irregular asylum seekers crossing the Canada-US border at Roxham Road, Quebec. A comparative discourse analysis finds that the media continues to frame Indigenous protesters and irregular asylum seekers as threats to the 'rule of law' and the `common good'. These framings discredit and delegitimize human rights claims that challenge the legitimacy of settler colonial borders - including the right to peaceful protest and to claim asylum - turning them into threats to Canada's sovereignty, thus necessitating state action. We conclude that this discourse has the effect of reproducing the racialized injustices and inequalities of ongoing settler colonialism.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;114&#xD;&#xD;Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;114</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Panofsky, S</author><author>Buchanan, MJ</author><author>Alfred, S</author><author>Brown, J</author><author>George, D</author><author>Naziel, W</author><author>Woodman, G</author><author>Brown, T</author><author>Lewis, R</author><author>Tes, SW</author><author>Naziel, L</author><author>Dumont, J</author><author>Andrew, J</author><author>Ferguson, A</author><author>Hare, J</author><author>John, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Wet'suwet'en Nation's Mobilization of Indigenous Focusing Oriented Therapy: An Exploratory Study</title><secondary-title>COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>COUNSELING PSYCHOLOGIST</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>HISTORICAL TRAUMA</keyword><keyword>MENTAL-HEALTH</keyword><keyword>decolonizing methodologies</keyword><keyword>historical trauma</keyword><keyword>Indigenous methodologies</keyword><keyword>indigenous trauma interventions</keyword><keyword>intergenerational trauma</keyword><keyword>land-based healing</keyword><keyword>PEOPLES</keyword><keyword>sharing circles</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0011-0000,1552-3861</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1177/00110000221146571</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Indigenous mental health research is beginning to address colonization, however, Indigenous approaches to wellness have largely been overlooked. There is a paucity of research exploring psychological trauma interventions with Indigenous peoples. The Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs recognize the profound impacts of historical trauma among their people and are utilizing Indigenous focusing oriented therapy (IFOT), a trauma model that is collective, land-based, and intergenerational, as a part of their wellness framework. This collaborative research study explored the question: How is IFOT shaped by Wet'suwet'en ways of knowing and mobilized by individuals, families, house groups, and the Nation? Wet'suwet'en IFOT practitioners participated in sharing circles for data collection and interpretation. The exploratory findings revealed that the strategic application of IFOT by Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs created a culturally relevant model for land-based healing wherein Wet'suwet'en people were able to experience greater connection with their own yintah (land) and c'idede' (history).</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45&#xD;&#xD;Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">10</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, ZP</author><author>Zhang, MF</author><author>Deng, SY</author><author>Hou, YP</author><author>Xu, YL</author><author>Lian, H</author><author>Wang, Y</author><author>IEEE</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assesing Effects of climate variability and forest disturbance on annual streamflow of the Stellako Watershed, Canada</title><secondary-title>IGARSS 2023 - 2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING SYMPOSIUM</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>University of Electronic Science &amp; Technology of China</full-title></periodical><pages>3110-3113</pages><keywords><keyword>Annual streamflow</keyword><keyword>Climate and non-climate variabilities</keyword><keyword>Forests</keyword><keyword>Modified double mass curve</keyword><keyword>Multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average</keyword><keyword>Remote sensing analysis ready data and products</keyword><keyword>Stellako watershed of Canada</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2153-6996</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1109/IGARSS52108.2023.10281825</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate variability and vegetation disturbance as critical driving factors significantly affect the regional hydrology in forested watersheds. Yet, due to landscape heterogeneities such as topography, soil characteristics, climate conditions, and vegetation types, hydrological responses to climate and forest changes and associated mechanisms have not been fully understood. The forested Stellako watershed, a typical forest-disturbed area in Canada, has been studied to assess the annual streamflow affected by climate variability and forest disturbance. The study period was from 1951 to 2018. The methods include the modified double mass curve (MDMC), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) intervention, and multivariate ARIMA. In the Stellako watershed, 1980 was identified as a breakpoint in the yearly time series between 1951 and 2018. The 1951-1979 period was considered the reference. From 1980 to 2018, the streamflow decreased by 14.69 and 26.18 mm due to climate and forest changes, respectively. The annual runoff variation was mainly attributed to forest disturbances contributing 60.78% of the total variations. Thus, a timely assessment of the runoff variety at a watershed scale has been obtained. The developed methodology can be applied to quantify the disturbance effects at a watershed or regional scale and develop watershed and forest management strategies under future climate and forest changes.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9</research-notes><language>English</language><custom3>University of Electronic Science &amp; Technology of China</custom3></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ryser, L</author><author>Barrett, J</author><author>Markey, S</author><author>Halseth, G</author><author>Vodden, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Municipal entrepreneurialism: Can it help to mobilize resource-dependent small communities away from path dependency?</title><secondary-title>REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REGIONAL SCIENCE POLICY AND PRACTICE</full-title></periodical><pages>1477-1492</pages><volume>15</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>rural</keyword><keyword>CREATION</keyword><keyword>municipal entrepreneurialism</keyword><keyword>path dependency</keyword><keyword>POLITICAL-ECONOMY</keyword><keyword>reform</keyword><keyword>TOURISM</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 SEP</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1757-7802</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/rsp3.12649</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Small resource-based communities across Canada are experiencing rapid change within a volatile, fluctuating global economy. As communities seek to diversify their economies, they are enduring complex provincial and federal neoliberal policy environments that offer fewer funding resources while offloading more responsibilities onto local governments. Drawing upon the case studies of Burns Lake, British Columbia and Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador in Canada, we explore how small municipalities are using municipal enterprises to generate revenue and assets that may lead to new economic pathways. Our findings suggest that municipal entrepreneurial strategies are producing mixed success to break from past forest-sector dependencies. These small municipalities still struggle with developmental and operational risks, as well as debates about whether to use revenues to meet new municipal responsibilities and increased demands on aging infrastructure and services versus transformative change.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;43</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vagle, S</author><author>Carmack, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Annual patterns of stratification, mixing and ventilation in long, deep, seasonally ice-covered Francois lake, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><keywords><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>CONVECTION</keyword><keyword>CRATER LAKE</keyword><keyword>deep lakes</keyword><keyword>FRESH-WATER</keyword><keyword>lake productivity</keyword><keyword>mixing</keyword><keyword>RESERVOIRS</keyword><keyword>seasonal stratification</keyword><keyword>SENTINELS</keyword><keyword>ventilation</keyword><keyword>WATER RENEWAL</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 FEB 21</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2296-6463</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/feart.2023.1090124</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Francois Lake is a long, deep, seasonally ice-covered, dimictic lake set in an east-west orientation in mid-British Columbia. As a baseline we here present data from a full-depth temperature mooring deployed at the lake's mid-point in 2004-2005 and one full-depth conductivity-temperature-depth cast. We use these temperature records to define lake stability, scales of motion and the annual cycle of thermal stratification, mixing and deep-water ventilation. Owing to its length (110 km) both the Wedderburn and Lake numbers-indices of thermocline tilt and mixing under wind forcing-transition through critical values during fall and spring seasons, suggesting thermocline outcropping and strong turbulent mixing within the thermocline at these times. Owing to its depth (240 m) the decreasing temperature of maximum density (T-MD) with depth (thermobaric effect) adds complexity to overturn events. Owing to its seasonal ice cover (2-3 months per year) the critical period for effective fall ventilation occurs before ice formation and concurrent wind shielding, while that of spring ventilation lies between the dates that the ice cover melts and the lake surface water warms above 4?. While the lake undergoes full depth ventilation in both fall and spring, we show that both progress in distinct dynamical stages. Fall ventilation is more efficient than that of spring, and the transition temperature and resulting bottom temperature from fall to winter stratification (positive to inverse) and winter to spring stratification (inverse to positive) lies close to the temperature of maximum density calculated for the maximum depth of free and forced convection (in this case, closer to 3.7?).</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;45</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sobral, BS</author><author>Déry, SJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatiotemporal distribution and trend analyses of atmospheric rivers affecting British Columbia's Nechako Watershed</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>6720-6732</pages><volume>43</volume><number>14</number><issue>14</issue><keywords><keyword>SCALE</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC</keyword><keyword>Nechako River Basin</keyword><keyword>atmospheric rivers</keyword><keyword>hydroclimatic data</keyword><keyword>trend analysis</keyword><keyword>MOISTURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 NOV 30</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0899-8418</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/joc.8230</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Research and shared interest in atmospheric rivers (ARs) have increased significantly in recent years, alongside technological improvements that allow better comprehension of these storms. The Nechako River Basin ( NRB) in British Columbia, Canada, is significantly affected by ARs originating in the Pacific Ocean. This work analyses the frequency, intensity, duration and trends of ARs in two regions (South and North) near the NRB. Analyses are based on data provided by an updated AR catalogue. The AR catalogue is matched on a daily scale to an adaptation of the AR scale to compile so-called AR-Days (ARDs). In the South region, ARDs exhibit stronger associations with hydroclimatic variables total precipitation, rain, snow and snow depth water equivalent (SWE). The Mann-Kendall (MK) trend test was applied to 364 time series created by combining the two closest AR-monitored regions to the NRB with the annual and seasonal scales of climate data and the adapted AR scale (ARD0-ARD5). Results show higher AR frequency of mainly beneficial ARDs during fall and a significant reduction of ARD1-ARD3 in both analysed regions. Rain and total precipitation related to ARD2- ARD3 also present significant decreasing trends for most sub- basins of the NRB. The MK test shows a shift in water contribution from total precipitation and rainfall linked to more potentially dangerous ARDs to short-duration, beneficial ARDs (ARD0). Rain from nonAR- related meteorological systems presents an increasing trend for the Upper Nechako sub-basin, where the Nechako Reservoir is located. Trends are mainly for AR-related total precipitation and rainfall, and in the northern part of the NRB, results point to the increase of AR-related SWE.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;42</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sang, ZHH</author><author>Hamann, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Record-Setting 2021 Heat Wave in Western Canada Had a Significant Temporary Impact on Greenness of the World's Largest Protected Temperate Rainforest</title><secondary-title>REMOTE SENSING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REMOTE SENSING</full-title></periodical><volume>15</volume><number>8</number><issue>8</issue><keywords><keyword>ECOSYSTEMS</keyword><keyword>SPRUCE</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>Pacific Northwest</keyword><keyword>PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>North America</keyword><keyword>DROUGHT</keyword><keyword>heat stress</keyword><keyword>DEATHS</keyword><keyword>enhanced vegetation index</keyword><keyword>EUROPE</keyword><keyword>extreme climate</keyword><keyword>heat dome</keyword><keyword>temperate rainforest</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 APR</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2072-4292</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs15082162</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Extreme climate anomalies are expected to become more frequent under climate change, and rare extreme events, such as the 2021 western North American heat wave, provide an opportunity for comparative empirical analysis of ecosystem resilience. This study evaluates anomalies in a remotely sensed enhanced vegetation index (EVI) in the aftermath of the record-setting western North American heat wave in 2021, with temperatures approaching 50 degrees C in coastal and interior regions of the Pacific Northwest. The results show that the forest ecosystems most affected were not necessarily those that experienced the highest absolute temperature values. Instead, the greatest reductions in greenness were observed across northern coastal temperate rainforests. Most affected were the cooler, very wet, hyper-maritime ecosystems that are normally buffered from large temperature fluctuation by a strong oceanic influence. In contrast, moisture-limited forests of the interior plateau of British Columbia, where most of the all-time record temperatures occurred, generally showed normal or even increased productivity during and after the heat wave. A putative explanation for this heat resistance of interior forests was normal or above average precipitation leading up to the heat event, allowing for transpirational cooling. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the largest protected coastal temperate rainforest in the world, with 6.4 million hectares, is comparatively more vulnerable to extreme heat waves, which are expected to become more frequent under climate warming, than other ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;53</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Oyinlola, MA</author><author>Khorsandi, M</author><author>Penman, R</author><author>Earhart, ML</author><author>Arsenault, R</author><author>Brauner, CJ</author><author>St-Hilaire, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrothermal impacts of water release on early life stages of white sturgeon in the Nechako river, BC Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF THERMAL BIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><volume>117</volume><keywords><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>RECRUITMENT</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>DAMS</keyword><keyword>SIZE</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>ACIPENSER-TRANSMONTANUS RICHARDSON</keyword><keyword>MARINE FISH</keyword><keyword>Nechako river</keyword><keyword>Physiological limits</keyword><keyword>Thermal exposure</keyword><keyword>THERMAL REGIMES</keyword><keyword>White sturgeon</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 OCT</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0306-4565</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jtherbio.2023.103682</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Water temperature plays a crucial role in the physiology of aquatic species, particularly in their survival and development. Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study. We also recorded major impacts of increased thermal exposure on the critical habitats necessary for Nechako white sturgeon recovery. Our study highlights the importance of a holistic management program with consideration for all species of the Nechako River system and the merit of possibly reviewing the current management plan, particularly with the current concerns about climate change impacts on the Nechako River.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;107</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Owens, PN</author><author>Rutherford, PM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Concentrations and total mass storage of fine sediment, potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and phosphorus in the channel bed of an urban river: a multi-year study</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</full-title></periodical><pages>3658-3670</pages><volume>23</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Metals</keyword><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>IDENTIFICATION</keyword><keyword>HEAVY-METALS</keyword><keyword>Road-deposited sediment</keyword><keyword>Nechako</keyword><keyword>SIZE</keyword><keyword>AGRICULTURAL CATCHMENTS</keyword><keyword>Anthropogenic activities</keyword><keyword>CONTAMINANTS</keyword><keyword>Culvert</keyword><keyword>GRAINED SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>MAIN CHANNEL</keyword><keyword>Streambed pollution</keyword><keyword>SUSPENDED-SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>WATER-QUALITY</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 OCT</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1439-0108</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11368-023-03624-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>PurposeGiven the rapid growth of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, this study examined the downstream trends in concentrations and determined the total storage of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) and phosphorus (P) associated with fine-grained sediment (0.45 to 63 &amp; mu;m) stored in the channel bed of an urban river.Materials and methodsSamples were collected from seven sites along McMillan Creek (watershed area = 55 km(2)) in the city of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, between 2010 and 2016 using a resuspension approach. Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements. Given the expected increase of people living in urban and peri-urban areas, more studies are required to assess the impacts of this growth on the amount and quality of fine-grained sediment stored in urban rivers.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;59</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Littel, GF</author><author>Bostock, MG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seismicity at the intersection of the Coast Shear Zone and Anahim Volcanic Belt near Bella Coola, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1688-1701</pages><volume>60</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>PLUTONIC COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>TECTONICS</keyword><keyword>TERRANE</keyword><keyword>BENEATH</keyword><keyword>SUBDUCTION</keyword><keyword>Coast Mountains</keyword><keyword>Anahim Volcanic Belt</keyword><keyword>Bella Coola</keyword><keyword>Coast Shear Zone</keyword><keyword>EARTHQUAKE</keyword><keyword>earthquake relocation</keyword><keyword>EMPLACEMENT</keyword><keyword>FAULT</keyword><keyword>PERMEABILITY</keyword><keyword>seismic swarm</keyword><keyword>STRESS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 DEC</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjes-2023-0057</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In the Coast Mountains of western British Columbia, an anomalous seismicity concentration exists near the intersection of the Coast Shear Zone, a major northwest-southeast trending Eocene-age shear zone that accommodated deformation between the Pacific and North America plates, with the Anahim Volcanic Belt, an east-northeast-west-northwest trending zone of volcanic features that decrease in age to the east. To better characterize seismicity in the Coast Mountains, we augment the existing Natural Resources Canada seismicity catalogue by applying an automatic detection and location algorithm to both permanent Canadian National Seismic Network stations and temporary stations from the 2005-2006 BATHOLITHS deployment, resulting in 837 relocated events with at least three paired P- and S-phase picks. Double-difference relocation reveals several small-scale linear strands subparallel to the Coast Shear Zone and within the Anahim Volcanic Belt and three clusters of events striking at a high angle to the Coast Shear Zone that occurred as swarms in 2015 and 2017. First-motion focal mechanisms exhibit extensional and strike-slip faulting. Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;71</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Larabi, S</author><author>Schnorbus, MA</author><author>Zwiers, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Diagnosing the ability of reservoir operations to meet hydropower production and fisheries needs under climate change in a western cordillera drainage basin</title><secondary-title>CLIMATIC CHANGE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIMATIC CHANGE</full-title></periodical><volume>176</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>EMERGENCE</keyword><keyword>Water temperature</keyword><keyword>IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>Nechako Reservoir</keyword><keyword>PARAMETERIZATION</keyword><keyword>SOCKEYE-SALMON</keyword><keyword>PREDICTION</keyword><keyword>Climate Change</keyword><keyword>NECHAKO RIVER</keyword><keyword>Water regulation</keyword><keyword>WATER TEMPERATURE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 DEC</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0165-0009</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10584-023-03632-y</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Water regulation has contributed to the decline in Pacific salmon in British Columbia (Canada) despite attempts to manage reservoir operations to achieve operational requirements while meeting environmental needs to limit fish thermal stress. The ability of reservoir managers to meet these trade-offs in a changing climate is unknown. Here, we examine the reliability and vulnerability of the Nechako Reservoir to meet hydropower production commitments and fisheries needs under two projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;59</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khorsandi, M</author><author>St-Hilaire, A</author><author>Arsenault, R</author><author>Martel, JL</author><author>Larabi, S</author><author>Schnorbus, M</author><author>Zwiers, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Future flow and water temperature scenarios in an impounded drainage basin: implications for summer flow and temperature management downstream of the dam</title><secondary-title>CLIMATIC CHANGE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLIMATIC CHANGE</full-title></periodical><volume>176</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>Climate change</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>IDENTIFICATION</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>PARAMETERIZATION</keyword><keyword>Nechako River</keyword><keyword>CEQUEAU model</keyword><keyword>River temperature</keyword><keyword>SAINT JOHN RIVER</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 DEC</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0165-0009</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10584-023-03634-w</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Water temperature is a key variable affecting fish habitat in rivers. The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios. These results show the decreasing habitat availability for Sockeye salmon due to climate change and the importance of water management in addressing this issue.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kieta, KA</author><author>Owens, PN</author><author>Petticrew, EL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determination of sediment sources following a major wildfire and evaluation of the use of color properties and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as tracers</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS</full-title></periodical><pages>4187-4207</pages><volume>23</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>SUSPENDED SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>Road-deposited sediment</keyword><keyword>Nechako River</keyword><keyword>PARTICLE-SIZE</keyword><keyword>Sediment fingerprinting</keyword><keyword>SOURCE FINGERPRINTING INVESTIGATIONS</keyword><keyword>ORGANIC-MATTER</keyword><keyword>Wildfire</keyword><keyword>NECHAKO RIVER</keyword><keyword>WATER-QUALITY</keyword><keyword>Conservative behavior</keyword><keyword>FOREST-FIRES</keyword><keyword>SOIL HYDROPHOBICITY</keyword><keyword>STABLE-ISOTOPES CSSIS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 DEC</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1439-0108</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11368-023-03565-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>PurposeThis research aimed to determine if a severe wildfire caused changes in the source of sediment being delivered to downstream aquatic systems and evaluate the use of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and color properties as tracers.MethodsSediment samples were collected from 2018 to 2021 in three tributaries impacted by the 2018 Shovel Lake wildfire and from two sites on the mainstem of the Nechako River, British Columbia. Source samples were collected from burned and unburned soils as well as from channel banks and road-deposited sediment. Samples were analyzed for color properties and for the 16 US Environmental Protection Agency priority PAHs. After statistical tests to determine the conservatism and ability to discriminate between sources by the tracers, the MixSIAR unmixing model was used, and its outputs were tested using virtual mixtures.ResultIn the tributaries, burned topsoil was an important contributor to sediment (up to 50%). The mainstem Nechako River was not influenced as significantly by the fires as the greatest contributor was banks (up to 89%). The color properties provided more realistic results than those based on PAHs.ConclusionIn smaller watersheds, the wildfire had a noticeable impact on sediment sources, though the impacts of the fire seemed to be diluted in the distal mainstem Nechako River. Color tracers behaved conservatively and discriminated between contrasting sources. Due to their low cost and reliability, they should be considered more widely. While PAHs did not work in this study, there are reasons to believe they could be a useful tracer, but more needs to be understood about their behavior and degradation over time.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;121</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kieta, KA</author><author>Owens, PN</author><author>Petticrew, EL</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Post-wildfire contamination of soils and sediments by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in north-central British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WILDLAND FIRE</full-title></periodical><pages>1071-1088</pages><volume>32</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>QUALITY</keyword><keyword>MANAGEMENT</keyword><keyword>BIOACCUMULATION</keyword><keyword>PINE</keyword><keyword>Nechako River Basin</keyword><keyword>watershed</keyword><keyword>NECHAKO RIVER</keyword><keyword>FOREST-FIRES</keyword><keyword>FATE</keyword><keyword>FINE SEDIMENT</keyword><keyword>ME-PAHS</keyword><keyword>polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</keyword><keyword>post-wildfire contamination</keyword><keyword>regional scale</keyword><keyword>soil pollutants</keyword><keyword>soils</keyword><keyword>suspended sediment</keyword><keyword>water pollutants</keyword><keyword>water quality</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1049-8001</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1071/WF22211</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Background. The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications. Wildfires are an important source of environmental contamination of terrestrial and aquatic environments.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;100</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hume, R</author><author>Walby, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"Invading Indigenous Territory is Not Reconciliation": Problematizing War Frames in News Coverage of Wet'suwet'en Solidarity Actions</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION</full-title></periodical><pages>689-714</pages><volume>48</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>DISCOURSE</keyword><keyword>protest</keyword><keyword>SOVEREIGNTY</keyword><keyword>PROTEST</keyword><keyword>extractivism</keyword><keyword>frame analysis</keyword><keyword>HISTORICAL REPRESENTATIONS</keyword><keyword>Indigenous sovereignty</keyword><keyword>mainstream news</keyword><keyword>MEDIA COVERAGE</keyword><keyword>MOVEMENT</keyword><keyword>US</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 DEC 1</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0705-3657</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3138/cjc-2022-0004</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Context: Leading up to the March 2020 global COVID-19 lockdown, an important movement was building power across so-called Canada. What began as a continuation of the decades-long, localized struggle for self-determination in Wet'suwet'en territory quickly became a focal point for nationwide Indigenous resistance, refusal, and solidarity.Analysis: Drawing from literature on media framing, this article examines the use of war frames in early 2020 news depictions of mobilizations in solidarity with Wet'suwet'en. The analysis suggests that war frames are operationalized to simultaneously naturalize police violence while also validating the sovereignty of Indigenous nations.Conclusion and implications: This work contributes not only to the literature on the framing of protests by the mainstream media but also to the ongoing project of unsettling conditions of settler colonial power in Canadian society.&#xD;Contexte : Dans les mois precedant le confinement de la COVID-19 en mars 2020, un mouvement important s'est developpe partout sur le territoire dit canadien. Ce qui avait commence comme une lutte regionale pour le droit a l'autodetermination des Wet'suwet'en est devenu un moment decisif de resistance, refus, et solidarite de la part des nations autochtones a l'echelle nationale.Analyses : Cet article s'inspire de l'analyse des cadres mediatiques pour examiner l'utilisation d'un lexique de guerre dans les representations faites par les medias des mouvements de solidarite pour les Wet'suwet'en au debut de 2020. L'analyse suggere que le lexique de guerre sert simultanement a naturaliser la violence policiere et a valider la souverainete des nations autochtones.Conclusion et implications : Cette recherche contribue non seulement a la litterature sur la maniere dont les medias grand public encadrent les manifestations, mais aussi au projet en cours qui consiste a remettre en question le pouvoir exerce par les colons dans la societe canadienne.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Earhart, ML</author><author>Blanchard, TS</author><author>Morrison, PR</author><author>Strowbridge, N</author><author>Penman, RJ</author><author>Brauner, CJ</author><author>Schulte, PM</author><author>Baker, DW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Identification of upper thermal thresholds during development in the endangered Nechako white sturgeon with management implications for a regulated river</title><secondary-title>CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CONSERVATION PHYSIOLOGY</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>GROWTH</keyword><keyword>TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>WATER</keyword><keyword>SURVIVAL</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>sturgeon</keyword><keyword>Conservation</keyword><keyword>development</keyword><keyword>PERFORMANCE</keyword><keyword>ACIPENSER-TRANSMONTANUS RICHARDSON</keyword><keyword>LAKE STURGEON</keyword><keyword>LARVAL</keyword><keyword>MAXIMUM CTMAX</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 JAN 1</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2051-1434</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/conphys/coad032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate change-induced warming effects are already evident in river ecosystems, and projected increases in temperature will continue to amplify stress on fish communities. In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature &lt;20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;78</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chen, XY</author><author>Hassan, MA</author><author>Bird, S</author><author>Rasouli, K</author><author>Fu, XD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The role of previously glaciated landscapes in spatiotemporal variability of streamflow in snow-dominated watersheds: British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY-REGIONAL STUDIES</full-title></periodical><volume>49</volume><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>HYDROLOGY</keyword><keyword>Correlation analysis</keyword><keyword>Glaciated landscapes</keyword><keyword>Hydrological signatures</keyword><keyword>REGIONALIZATION</keyword><keyword>Snow -dominated watersheds</keyword><keyword>Streamflow variability</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 OCT</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2214-5818</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejrh.2023.101478</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Study region: Twenty-six glaciated basins on the Interior Plateau (56 degrees N, 125 degrees W) in British Columbia, Canada.Study focus: Landscape and streamflow characteristics in glaciated basins show high spatiotem-poral variability, while the linkages among runoff characteristics, landscapes, and glacial history remain unclear. We compiled a 10-year dataset of daily climate and streamflow observations, and 54 landscape attributes for 26 glaciated basins to explore the relationship between landscape, streamflow and glacial history. A Hierarchical Multiple Factor Analysis was performed to analyze landscapes. The hydrological signatures were selected to describe streamflow characteristics. A correlation analysis and machine learning models were used to explore the relationships between the glacial legacy and streamflow variation. New hydrological insights for the region:(1) The landscape is well-structured. The principal components of PC1 and PC2 explain 44% of the total landscape variance, PC1 representing basins with steep, high-relief terrain and alpine glaciation and PC2 representing large, elongated basins with moraine and glacial lakes; (2) The landscape heterogeneity has a key role in accurate streamflow predictions. Most hydrological signatures are controlled by landscape components PC1 and PC2 and can be well predicted by Random Forest using landscape features as inputs. (3) Alpine glaciation results in rapid runoff generation and variable flow regime in mountains, while valley glaciation leads to smooth hydrographs with large baseflows and mild and infrequent extreme flow events in plateaus.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;70</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Charles, P</author><author>Arsenault, R</author><author>Martel, JL</author><author>Gatien, P</author><author>St-Hilaire, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the evolution of ensemble water temperature forecasts as a function of weather forecast lead-time: case study on the Nechako River watershed</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN WATER RESOURCES JOURNAL</full-title></periodical><pages>72-92</pages><volume>48</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>MODEL</keyword><keyword>BASIN</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE</keyword><keyword>DOWNSTREAM</keyword><keyword>forecasting</keyword><keyword>lead-time</keyword><keyword>probabilistic ensembles</keyword><keyword>REGIME</keyword><keyword>STREAM TEMPERATURE</keyword><keyword>uncertainty</keyword><keyword>UNCERTAINTY</keyword><keyword>Water temperature</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 APR 3</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0701-1784</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/07011784.2022.2163189</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Producing and improving hydrological and hydrodynamic forecasts while accounting for uncertainty through a probabilistic approach is useful in various applications, such as for water temperature forecasting. To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;57</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Coker, ES</author><author>Turna, NS</author><author>Schouwenburg, M</author><author>Jalil, A</author><author>Bradshaw, C</author><author>Kuo, MC</author><author>Mastel, M</author><author>Kazemian, H</author><author>Roushorne, M</author><author>Henderson, SB</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterization of the short-term temporal variability of road dust chemical mixtures and meteorological profiles in a near-road urban site in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF THE AIR &amp; WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF THE AIR &amp; WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION</full-title></periodical><pages>502-516</pages><volume>73</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>PARTICLES</keyword><keyword>HEAVY-METALS</keyword><keyword>AIR-POLLUTION</keyword><keyword>AMBIENT AIR</keyword><keyword>DAILY MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>EXPOSURE</keyword><keyword>HEALTH-RISK</keyword><keyword>PARTICULATE MATTER CONSTITUENTS</keyword><keyword>SIZE DISTRIBUTION</keyword><keyword>SOURCE APPORTIONMENT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 JUN 3</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1096-2247</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10962247.2023.2186964</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Springtime road dust is a common air quality concern for northern latitudes communities. Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects. The complex relationships between road dust and weather identified in this study may facilitate further research on the health effects of chemical mixtures related to road dust while also highlighting potential changes in this unique form of air pollution as the climate changes.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;59</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Babey, CN</author><author>Gantner, N</author><author>Shrimpton, JM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigating patterns and extent of predation of hatchery-reared juvenile Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) by North American river otter (Lontra canadensis) in the Nechako River, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF ZOOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>776-793</pages><volume>101</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>PIT tag</keyword><keyword>predation</keyword><keyword>white sturgeon</keyword><keyword>ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>KOOTENAI RIVER</keyword><keyword>LAKE STURGEON</keyword><keyword>AVIAN PREDATION</keyword><keyword>conservation aquaculture</keyword><keyword>CONSERVATION AQUACULTURE</keyword><keyword>FOOD-HABITS</keyword><keyword>FULVESCENS RAFINESQUE</keyword><keyword>latrine</keyword><keyword>LUTRA-LUTRA L</keyword><keyword>PASSIVE INTEGRATED TRANSPONDERS</keyword><keyword>river otter</keyword><keyword>SCAPHIRHYNCHUS-ALBUS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 SEP</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4301</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjz-2022-0148</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Predation of fish released as part of conservation aquaculture programs may undermine conservation goals. Identification of factors influencing predation, therefore, can inform management decisions that minimize predation losses. For the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus Richardson, 1836), the survival of individuals released as part of a conservation aquaculture program is threatened by river otter (Lontra canadensis (Schreber, 1777)) predation. Through the recovery of sturgeon passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags from otter latrines, we set out to quantify the extent of predation, identify spatial patterns in predation including identifying predation hotspots, and understand the timing of predation. The recovery of 3.9% of PIT tags from the hatchery-released sturgeon represents a minimum predation estimate based on several identified factors. The distribution of predation hotspots varied by release cohort, with some consistent hotspots among cohorts. An apparent decrease in predation in recent years was seen in conjunction with fewer live captures and lower release numbers, suggesting some level of density-dependent predation. Results from this study can be used to contribute to management decisions related to Nechako white sturgeon recovery efforts, inform further research needs, and contribute to a growing knowledge of sturgeon predation.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;103</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Armstrong, CG</author><author>Spice, A</author><author>Ridsdale, M</author><author>Welch, JR</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Liberating trails and travel routes in Gitxsan and Wet'suwet'en Territories from the tyrannies of heritage resource management regimes</title><secondary-title>AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST</full-title></periodical><pages>361-376</pages><volume>125</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Wet'suwet'en</keyword><keyword>PLACE</keyword><keyword>ARCHAEOLOGY</keyword><keyword>historical ecology</keyword><keyword>mapping</keyword><keyword>compliance archaeology</keyword><keyword>Gitxsan</keyword><keyword>heritage resource management</keyword><keyword>trail archaeology</keyword><keyword>trails</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023 JUN</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0002-7294</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/aman.13817</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Despite their unmistakable significance in regional histories and unique roles in cultural transmission and traditions, Indigenous trail systems are frequently ignored in non-Indigenous heritage resource management regimes. These regulatory regimes often require that heritage have discrete spatial and temporal boundaries and predefined material attributes and functions. However, as landscape-scale connectors of peoples, places, and times that blend spiritual, economic, and educational functions, trails challenge these proscriptions. Trails eschew cost-effective identification, documentation, and conservation. Accordingly, and because trails cannot be adequately documented without the expertise of people whose lands and communities they serve, archaeologists tasked with identifying heritage in advance of resource extraction and land alteration projects often omit trails from assessments. Shortcomings in heritage conservation regimes in British Columbia and elsewhere are resulting in the obliteration of Indigenous trails at precisely the time they are needed to support the revitalization of Territory-Community relationships at the core of Indigeneity. We address this tragedy by integrating archaeology, ethnography, remote sensing, and collaborative fielwork to document trails in Wet'suwet'en and Gitxsan Territories. This enables protection in heritage management contexts and renewed and expanded trail use in intergenerational and intercultural contexts in support of Indigenous community futurity, survivance, and shared senses of community, geography, and stewardship.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0&#xD;Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Film or Broadcast">21</ref-type><titles><title>B.C.

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Observed records of past outbreaks are usually short and incomplete, therefore long proxy data are useful for better understanding of the spatial synchrony. In this study, we developed tree-ring proxy records of two-year cycle spruce budworm (Choristoneura biennis Freeman) outbreaks in central British Columbia, Canada, and examined the spatial patterns of past outbreaks. This budworm is a major defoliating: insect of the interior spruce (Picea engelmannii Parry x P. glauca Moench) and subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa [Hook.] Nutt.) forests in the Prince George Region of British Columbia, Four outbreaks occurred in relatively close synchrony over the entire region in the period 1880-1999, however, the initiation year, the intensity and extent of outbreaks varied spatially and from one outbreak to another, In some instances, the occurrence of outbreaks was restricted to only one area. The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks. Dispersal might play a role in synchronizing outbreaks, but the extent to which it contributed to the synchrony was limited in this mountainous region.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;32</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhang, GW</author><author>Hynes, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fabrics and Kinematic indicators associated with the local structures along Finlay-Ingenika fault, McConnell Creek area, North-central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1687-1699</pages><volume>31</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>ANISOTROPY</keyword><keyword>BLOCK ROTATION</keyword><keyword>COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>DEAD-SEA TRANSFORM</keyword><keyword>DEFORMATION</keyword><keyword>DISPLACEMENT</keyword><keyword>MAGNETIC-SUSCEPTIBILITY</keyword><keyword>PALEOMAGNETIC EVIDENCE</keyword><keyword>ROCKS</keyword><keyword>STRAIN</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e94-151</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Structures associated with dextral transcurrent displacement on the Finlay - Ingenika fault are characterized predominantly by subvertical to vertical faults.

Principal directions of the strain ellipsoids determined from the deformed volcanic fragments along one of the faults are in accordance with those of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from the adjacent plutonic rocks, indicating that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics.

But downward continuation is usually unstable, with shallow downward continuation depth and inaccurate result. To this end, this paper presents a Milne formula method for downward continuation of gravity field by using gravity field and its first-order vertical derivatives, and based on Simpson quadrature formula. The method is applied to the synthetic model. The synthetic result and the error curve show that compared with the fast Fourier transform downward continuation method and the integral iteration downward continuation method, the new method's depth of downward continuation is larger, the relative error is smaller, and the result is stable and accurate to the model. The method is applied to the downward continuation of the measured airborne gravity data of Nechako basin in Canada. The downward continuation result of this method can restore the original data accurately. And the result can reflect the tendency of the original anomaly and enhance the local and tiny anomaly.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;18</research-notes><language>Chinese</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Yang, J</author><author>Oviedo-Joekes, E</author><author>Christian, KM</author><author>Li, K</author><author>Louie, M</author><author>Schechter, M</author><author>Spittal, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cedar Project: Methadone maintenance treatment among young Aboriginal people who use opioids in two Canadian cities</title><secondary-title>DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>DRUG AND ALCOHOL REVIEW</full-title></periodical><pages>645-651</pages><volume>30</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>IMPACT</keyword><keyword>BEHAVIOR</keyword><keyword>MORTALITY</keyword><keyword>VANCOUVER</keyword><keyword>drug use</keyword><keyword>RISK-FACTORS</keyword><keyword>Aboriginal people</keyword><keyword>ALCOHOL-USE</keyword><keyword>GENDER-DIFFERENCES</keyword><keyword>HEROIN USERS</keyword><keyword>HIV-INFECTION</keyword><keyword>INJECTION-DRUG USERS</keyword><keyword>methadone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0959-5236</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1465-3362.2010.00258.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Introduction and Aims. The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiometric corrections, dark target subtractions and geometric corrections were applied to the imagery. Following application of an unsupervised hyperclustering procedure which employed the K-means classifier, post-classification comparisons examined the differences in spectral response patterns for several target classes, and area summaries were generated to compare the variability in the total area of classes as identified in each image. Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates. These findings suggest that off-year imagery (acquired on or near anniversary dates) may be preferred to off-season imagery when building large-area Landsat mosaics for land cover classification using the hyperclustering procedure.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wu, HX</author><author>Ying, CC</author><author>Muir, JA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effect of geographic variation and jack pine introgression on disease and insect resistance in lodgepole pine</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FOREST RESEARCH-REVUE CANADIENNE DE RECHERCHE FORESTIERE</full-title></periodical><pages>711-726</pages><volume>26</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>ALBERTA</keyword><keyword>BANKSIANA</keyword><keyword>CONTORTA PROVENANCES</keyword><keyword>EVOLUTION</keyword><keyword>HYBRIDIZATION</keyword><keyword>LOPHODERMELLA-CONCOLOR</keyword><keyword>MONOTERPENE</keyword><keyword>MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION</keyword><keyword>NEEDLE CAST</keyword><keyword>WESTERN GALL RUST</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0045-5067</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/x26-081</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Incidence of western gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii (J.P.

Edwards) (Lepidoptera: Sesiidae)) attacks were investigated in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) provenance-family test plantation located at Red Rock Tree Improvement Station, Prince George, British Columbia. This plantation contains 778 wind-pollinated families from 53 provenances in British Columbia, Alberta, and the Yukon Territory. Pest incidence was assessed in 1993 when the plantation was 21 years old. Provenance had a significant effect on resistance to the four disease and insect attacks. Regression models using latitude, longitude, and elevation as predictors accounted for 38% to 80% of the provenance variation in pest incidence. Geographic patterns of genetic variation in pest resistance essentially followed longitudinal and elevational dines. The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine. Effective selection and breeding for pest resistance in lodgepole pine may have to look beyond the intraspecific gene pool.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;63</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, LJ</author><author>Smith, DJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Intra-annual dendroclimatic reconstruction for northern British Columbia, Canada, using wood properties</title><secondary-title>TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>TREES-STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION</full-title></periodical><pages>461-474</pages><volume>29</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Temperature</keyword><keyword>COAST MOUNTAINS</keyword><keyword>PARAMETERS</keyword><keyword>VARIABILITY</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>Dendroclimatology</keyword><keyword>Fibre properties</keyword><keyword>FORESTS</keyword><keyword>LODGEPOLE PINE</keyword><keyword>MAXIMUM LATEWOOD DENSITY</keyword><keyword>MICROFIBRIL ANGLE</keyword><keyword>Precipitation</keyword><keyword>RADIAL GROWTH</keyword><keyword>Tree physiology</keyword><keyword>TREE-RING WIDTH</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0931-1890,1432-2285</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00468-014-1124-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Key message Analyses of tree-ring wood properties combined with an understanding of tree physiology provided detailed intra-annual insights into historical and seasonal climate phenomena in sub-boreal forests of northern British Columbia. Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics. Tree physiological responses to climate at different times throughout the growing season, and temperature and precipitation fluctuations over the historical record are discussed.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;9 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, LJ</author><author>Hartley, ID</author><author>Watson, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Determining hybridization in Jack Pine and Lodgepole Pine from British Columbia</title><secondary-title>WOOD AND FIBER SCIENCE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>WOOD AND FIBER SCIENCE</full-title></periodical><pages>386-395</pages><volume>41</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Fiber Quality Analysis</keyword><keyword>Hybridization</keyword><keyword>Pinus banksiana</keyword><keyword>Pinus contorta var. latifolia</keyword><keyword>SilviScan</keyword><keyword>wood properties</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0735-6161</isbn><abstract>This study was conducted to find wood quality evidence of hybridization between jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia) in northeast British Columbia (BC). To determine if wood and fiber traits could be used as distinguishing features among jack pine, lodgepole pine, and their hybrids. differences in morphology and wood and fiber traits were related to the genetic identity of each sample. Thirty samples each Of pure lodgepole pine, pure jack pine, and potential hybrids were collected from the Prince George area of BC, the Smoky Lake area of Alberta, and the Fort Nelson region of BC. respectively. Two 10-mm cores (bark to bark) were taken from each tree and analyzed for fiber length and coarseness, microfibril angle (MFA), basic density, early wood:latewood ratios, and cell dimensions. Needle and cone morphology was used to distinguish among Species groups in the field. Based on genetically identified samples, the fiber traits that best differentiated among pure jack pine, lodgepole pine, and hybrids were MFA and cell area.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, CC</author><author>Foote, CJ</author><author>Rutherford, DT</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ecological interactions between juveniles of reproductively isolated anadromous and non-anadromous morphs of sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, sharing the same nursery lake</title><secondary-title>ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENVIRONMENTAL BIOLOGY OF FISHES</full-title></periodical><pages>161-173</pages><volume>54</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>ATLANTIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>diet</keyword><keyword>kokanee</keyword><keyword>speciation</keyword><keyword>GENETIC-DIFFERENCES</keyword><keyword>ADAPTIVE RADIATION</keyword><keyword>character displacement</keyword><keyword>CHARACTER DISPLACEMENT</keyword><keyword>competition</keyword><keyword>FEEDING MOTIVATION</keyword><keyword>genetic markers</keyword><keyword>LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES</keyword><keyword>MIXED-STOCK FISHERIES</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>PREDATION RISK</keyword><keyword>reproductive isolation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0378-1909</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1023/A:1007491220512</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sockeye salmon and kokanee, the anadromous and non-anadromous morphs of Oncorhynchus nerka, spawn in close physical proximity in tributaries to Takla Lake, British Columbia but are reproductively isolated and genetically distinct. Using genetic markers, we were able to investigate, for the first time, ecological interactions between the morphs as juveniles sharing the same nursery lake. Trawl and hydroacoustic surveys conducted in August of 1988 and 1991 revealed that juvenile O. nerka were distributed fairly evenly throughout Talka Lake with average densities ranging from 351-558 fish ha(-1) in the north arm to 585-769 fish ha(-1) in the west arm. Sockeye salmon were predominant (71-75 %) in the west arm whereas kokanee were predominant (82%) in the north arm, a difference attributed to the distribution of spawners in the brood years studied. Within arms, the morphs were intermixed with no detectable difference in relative abundance by depth or among trawl catches. Both morphs were highly selective in their diet, especially in the north arm where fish densities and grazing pressure were lower. As age 0 juveniles, sockeye salmon were significantly larger than kokanee (53 vs. 39 mm on average) but their food habits were virtually identical. Thus we found no evidence of behaviour that would reduce niche overlap between these incipient species.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;65</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wood, CC</author><author>Foote, CJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evidence for sympatric genetic divergence of anadromous and nonanadromous morphs of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)</title><secondary-title>EVOLUTION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>EVOLUTION</full-title></periodical><pages>1265-1279</pages><volume>50</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>EGG SIZE</keyword><keyword>Oncorhynchus nerka</keyword><keyword>assortative mating</keyword><keyword>divergent selection</keyword><keyword>isolating mechanisms</keyword><keyword>kokanee</keyword><keyword>sockeye</keyword><keyword>speciation</keyword><keyword>sympatric populations</keyword><keyword>PACIFIC SALMON</keyword><keyword>anadromy</keyword><keyword>BROWN TROUT</keyword><keyword>HABITAT PREFERENCE</keyword><keyword>NEIGHBOR-JOINING METHOD</keyword><keyword>PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY</keyword><keyword>REPRODUCTIVE ISOLATION</keyword><keyword>SALVELINUS-ALPINUS</keyword><keyword>WHITEFISH COREGONUS-CLUPEAFORMIS</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0014-3820,1558-5646</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1558-5646.1996.tb02367.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Anadromous and nonanadromous morphs of the Pacific salmon Oncorhynchus nerka ka spawn in close physical proximity in tributaries to Takla Lake, British Columbia, yet differ in morphology, gill raker number, allozyme allele frequencies, and reproductive traits. Both morphs are semelparous typically maturing at age four, the anadromous morph (sockeye) at fork lengths of 38-65 cm and the nonanadromous morph (kokanee) at 17-22 cm. When reared together, pure and hybrid morphs also exhibited different growth rates and maturity schedules. Collectively, these large differences between the morphs confirm that sockeye and kokanee exist as reproductively isolated populations. Average gene flow (m) was estimated to be 0.1-0.8% between morphs, 1.7-3.7% among tributaries for kokanee, and 0.3-5.6% among tributaries for sockeye.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team. A significant portion of time and resources needs to be allocated towards travel to these communities. While achieving equity in recruiting research participants poses a number of challenges, including greater costs, research that ensures participation opportunities for rural and FN communities is likely to better inform effective strategies to meet the needs of these communities.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;40</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wolfe, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variable NIP pressures improve paper quality at Prince George.</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>73-73</pages><volume>84</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Magazine Article">19</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wolfe, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Ommiting screen tubes reduces explosion risk at Prince George</title><secondary-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PULP &amp; PAPER-CANADA</full-title></periodical><pages>11-12</pages><volume>84</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><dates><year>1983</year><pub-dates><date>1983</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0316-4004</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Winkler, RD</author><author>Moore, RD</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability in snow accumulation patterns within forest stands on the interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>3683-3695</pages><volume>20</volume><number>17</number><issue>17</issue><keywords><keyword>spatial analysis</keyword><keyword>COVER</keyword><keyword>CATCHMENT</keyword><keyword>DEPLETION</keyword><keyword>DEPTH</keyword><keyword>forest cover</keyword><keyword>snow accumulation</keyword><keyword>WATER EQUIVALENT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.6382</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Previous research has highlighted the relationship between snow accumulation and forest stand characteristics, as well as the effects of topography, but not the variability within stands. This study examined spatial patterns in snow accumulation within forest stands, their consistency from year to year, and the extent to which they can be predicted from commonly used stand measurements. Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average. Of the stand inventory variables measured, crown closure explained the largest proportion of the variability in SWE within each stand, but together with year never more than 43%. The strongest correlations between snow water equivalent and crown closure were found in those stands exhibiting the greatest consistency in interannual spatial patterns of snow accumulation.

Throughout most of Canada's history, these resources have been viewed within a supply-management framework and, frequently, exploited through the construction of 'megaprojects', often with little or no concern for issues such as environmental harm and social and community disruption. As in many parts of the world, those most affected by such large-scale water resource developments have been aboriginals (in Canada, 'First Nations' peoples). Although the issues of environmental, social and economic damage to First Nations as a result of water megaprojects have been investigated, little has been written about the impact of such projects - especially dam construction - on the loss of sense of place of deracinated peoples. This paper investigates one example of such loss of sense of place, that of the Cheslatta T'En forcibly removed from their ancestral lands in the 1950s so as to allow for the construction of a private hydroelectric dam by the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan).</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;44 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;182</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson, JY</author><author>Addison, RF</author><author>Martens, D</author><author>Gordon, R</author><author>Glickman, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Cytochrome P450 1A and related measurements in juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the Fraser River</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF FISHERIES AND AQUATIC SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>405-413</pages><volume>57</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>BRITISH-COLUMBIA</keyword><keyword>FISH</keyword><keyword>WASHINGTON</keyword><keyword>KRAFT MILL EFFLUENT</keyword><keyword>CONTAMINANT EXPOSURE</keyword><keyword>DNA-ADDUCTS</keyword><keyword>ENGLISH SOLE</keyword><keyword>LIVER-MICROSOMES</keyword><keyword>PUGET-SOUND</keyword><keyword>SYNTHETIC PEPTIDE</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0706-652X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/cjfas-57-2-405</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Juvenile chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were captured at six sites on the upper Fraser, Nechako, and Thompson rivers, British Columbia, Canada. Biological responses were measured in the liver to assess the effects of contaminants on the fish before they began migration downstream. Both ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity and CYP 1A concentrations were significantly enhanced, being two- to three-fold higher in Fraser River samples compared with those fish from reference sites on the Nechako River. DNA adduct concentrations were two- to four-fold higher in Fraser River fish, although liver histopathology appeared unaffected. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in the carcasses contributed to total contaminant burdens of less than 1 pg,g(-1). Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) metabolites were undetectable in nearly all samples of bile. There were strong correlations between EROD activity, CYP 1A induction, and DNA adduct concentrations but no clear correlation between these responses and PCDD, PCDF, or PCB concentrations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;20 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;34</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Generic">13</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilson Hydrotechnical Services</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"Kenney Dam Cold Water Release Facility Memorandum on Costs"</title></titles><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Northern BC Archives &amp; Special Collections</publisher><language>English</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://unbc.summon.serialssolutions.com/2.0.0/link/0/eLvHCXMwlV09T8MwED1BWNiKAPGtU_dC3Hw0HiltKKq6VJUQU2QnLgzURW0y5N9zZ4eFrZMV2Yn8obzzWe89A0TDx3DwDxOMivial1KLKhmthSZkjkOjKXqJtZKKxckf83g8l-NVsuw8k1ga0y231ZTeN9Yr7ShkJXyeLxh6j6MwC-Dk-fVtOmEes3XS-VEXH_Ie9LyDq_rGhardop7BkbHn8Nl3UNbiRG2QsvQK37kBLgnuKYBgrkpmp7a4YMorpfXNBreWWu7rfR9_dsYxxFG36I0VcdZWzlrhywka8e9fv4A0n65eZgPuW0GZ9KZgS2c_soJHVrgaKvmB6xIZZWl0CYHdWnMFmMVsSZMpSZvLWBipUpPKYapVWApDW_xreDrw4zcHv3ELp54qwfSrOwjqXWPu_YQ_dPP_C9_amYQ</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilmeth, Roscoe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Distribution of several types of Obsidian fromarchaeological sites in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>Bulletin (Canadian Archaeological Association)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bulletin (Canadian Archaeological Association)</full-title><abbr-1>Bulletin (Canadian Archaeological Association)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>27-60</pages><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1973</year><pub-dates><date>1973</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0315-761X</isbn><abstract>The present study developed from a pilot programme intended to test the usefulness of neutron activation analysis for determining sources of obsidian from sites near Anahim Lake, British Columbia.

This paper describes a study that investigated perceptions of climate change risk to forest ecosystems and forest-based communities among a sample of Canadian forestry experts. Data were collected by questionnaire from participants at a climate change and forestry workshop, sponsored by the Canadian Climate Impacts and Adaptation Research Network Forest Sector and the McGregor Model Forest held in Prince George, British Columbia in February 2003. These forestry experts were somewhat concerned about the impacts of climate change, and they appeared unlikely to oppose strategies for preparing for and adapting to climate change. The respondents felt that the effects of climate change on forests and forest-based communities are not well understood by the general public or forest managers. They also felt that there is a relatively high level of uncertainty about the effects of climate change, especially with respect to forest-based communities. These results have important implications, including reinforcement of the need for greater awareness of climate change risks and for increased research and monitoring effort targeted at reducing levels of uncertainty about future impacts at local scales.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;46 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wikler, Maia</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Remembering forward: navigating the everyday of forced displacement with the Cheslatta T'en.</title></titles><keywords><keyword>Saturation search (2)</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>University of British Columbia</publisher><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wiebe, J</author><author>Huebert, KM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Community mobile treatment - What it is and how it works</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE TREATMENT</full-title></periodical><pages>23-31</pages><volume>13</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>addictions treatment</keyword><keyword>community development</keyword><keyword>mobile treatment</keyword><keyword>native</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0740-5472</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0740-5472(95)02044-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In 1984, Paul Hanki of Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, developed community mobile treatment, an innovative approach to substance abuse treatment in Native communities. The feature that distinguishes community mobile treatment from most other forms of treatment is the strong emphasis on community involvement. Before an actual treatment program is implemented, the community must acknowledge that a substance abuse problem exists and be committed and involved in addressing the problem. Once a community is mobilized, a 21 to 28 day intensive alcohol and drug treatment program for substance abusers and their families is brought into the community. Since ifs inception in 1984, community mobile treatment has been implemented in approximately 17 Canadian communities. The few evaluations that have been conducted suggest that this approach holds much promise in reducing alcohol and drug-related problems. This article reviews the existing documentation and provides a comprehensive description of this unique approach.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Widdowson, JDA</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>As it comes, Folk Fiddling in Prince-George, British Columbia-Gibson, RW</title><secondary-title>FOLKLORE</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>FOLKLORE</full-title></periodical><pages>131-132</pages><volume>96</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1985</year><pub-dates><date>1985</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0015-587X,1469-8315</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whittaker, PJ</author><author>Watkinson, DH</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Genesis of Cromitite from the Mitchell range, Central British-Columbia.</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN MINERALOGIST</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN MINERALOGIST</full-title></periodical><pages>161-172</pages><volume>22</volume><dates><year>1984</year><pub-dates><date>1984</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4476</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;16 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Whalen, JB</author><author>Anderson, RG</author><author>Struik, LC</author><author>Villeneuve, ME</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Geochemistry and Nd isotopes of the Francois Lake plutonic suite, Endako batholith: host and progenitor to the Endako molybdenum camp, central British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>603-618</pages><volume>38</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>CLASSIFICATION</keyword><keyword>ROCKS</keyword><keyword>AUSTRALIA</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>CHEMISTRY</keyword><keyword>DEPOSITS</keyword><keyword>I-TYPE</keyword><keyword>LACHLAN FOLD BELT</keyword><keyword>S-TYPE GRANITES</keyword><keyword>TRACE-ELEMENT</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e00-080</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Endako low-F granodiorite-type porphyry Mo deposit is hosted by the Triassic to Eocene Endako batholith, which comprises five temporally distinct plutonic suites, only one of which is mineralized. Pre-mineralization suites range in composition from diorite to granodiorite. The synmineralization Jurassic-Cretaceous Francois Lake suite includes two granodiorite- to monzogranite-bearing subsuites. Postmineralization phases include the Eocene Sam Ross Creek monzogranite. The batholith spans a silica range of 44-80 wt.% and consists of metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, low- to high-K, I-type granitoids; the Sam Ross Creek phase is an A-type granite. Positive epsilon (Nd)(T) values (+1.1 to +7.2) indicate derivation predominately from juvenile source materials, but with variable input from an older crustal component. Evidence suggests generation of older plutonic suites in a juvenile arc-type setting and younger K-rich felsic suites via recycling of juvenile arc crust without significant mantle-derived contributions. Three distinct Mo-deposition events in the Endako camp are linked to repeated generations of oxidized, highly evolved monzogranitic phases (pre-ore dykes, aplitic Nithi and Casey intrusions) belonging to both Francois Lake subsuites. Late pre-ore dykes with "Casey-like" geochemical signatures, along with massive unmineralized Casey intrusions near the Endako deposit, could reflect repeated injections from an underlying magma chamber that remained molten during the youngest Mo-deposition event. A genetic link may exist between the Sam Ross Creek phase, a pluton with Climax-type granite characteristics, and Eocene kaolinite alteration in the Endako deposit. Also, potential exists for Eocene-age Climax-type Mo mineralization within the Endako mining camp.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;29 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;33 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;53</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Weech, SA</author><author>Scheuhammer, AM</author><author>Elliott, JE</author><author>Cheng, KM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mercury in fish from the Pinchi Lake Region, British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION</full-title></periodical><pages>275-286</pages><volume>131</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ACCUMULATION</keyword><keyword>mercury</keyword><keyword>SEDIMENTS</keyword><keyword>BIOACCUMULATION</keyword><keyword>BIOMAGNIFICATION</keyword><keyword>FOOD-WEB</keyword><keyword>ISOTOPE ANALYSIS</keyword><keyword>CONTAMINATION</keyword><keyword>CLEAR LAKE</keyword><keyword>fish</keyword><keyword>lake</keyword><keyword>METHYLMERCURY</keyword><keyword>mining</keyword><keyword>sediment</keyword><keyword>TROPHIC POSITION</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0269-7491,1873-6424</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envpol.2004.02.016</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Water, surface sediments, and &lt;40 cm rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and northern pikeminnow (Ptychocheilus oregonensis) were collected from Pinchi Lake, British Columbia, and from several nearby reference lakes. Hg concentrations in sediment samples from Pinchi L. were highly elevated compared to sediments from reference lakes, especially in sites adjacent to and downstream of a former Hg mine. In both fish species examined, Hg concentration was positively related to age and/or fork length. In northern pikeminnow, Hg concentrations were also positively related to trophic level (deltaN). Hg concentrations in both fish species were highest in Pinchi L., and were higher in pikeminnow than in rainbow trout of similar size. Average Hg concentrations in small rainbow trout from all lakes, including Pinchi L., were lower than dietary levels reported to cause reproductive impairment in common loons (Gavia immer); however, Hg levels in small pikeminnow from Pinchi L. were sufficiently high to be of concern. The risk for Hg toxicity in the study area is greatest for animals that consume larger piscivorous fish such as larger northern pikeminnow or lake trout, which are known from previous studies to contain higher Hg concentrations.

Eggs of red-necked grebes (Podiceps grisgena) also were collected and analyzed. Mercury levels in species at various trophic levels from Pinchi Lake averaged approximately twice those in the same species from nearby lakes combined, even in the absence of substantial new inputs of Hg to Pinchi Lake over several decades. In Pinchi Lake, Hg concentrations in blood and feathers of eagles and eggs of grebes were significantly higher than those in corresponding samples from reference lakes. However, the mean Hg concentration (0.25 mu g/g wet wt) in grebe eggs from Pinchi Lake was substantially lower than accepted threshold levels for reproductive toxicity in most avian species (0.5-1.0 mu g/g wet wt). Mercury concentrations in the blood of adult eagles and their chicks were highly correlated (r = 0.91, p = 0.004). Despite elevated Hg exposure in adult eagles nesting on Pinchi Lake (blood Hg concentration, 4.3-9.4 mu g/ml), birds appeared to be in good body condition, did not differ significantly in terms of weight from eagles nesting on reference takes, and exhibited no evidence of obvious abnormal behavior or lack of coordination. Eagle reproductive success and productivity on Pinchi Lake were not significantly different from those on all reference lakes combined (p = 0.483).</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;38 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;47</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, J</author><author>Sui, J</author><author>Guo, L</author><author>Karney, BW</author><author>Jupner, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Forecast of water level and ice jam thickness using the back propagation neural network and support vector machine methods</title><secondary-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>215-224</pages><volume>7</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>ACCUMULATION</keyword><keyword>COVER</keyword><keyword>Ice jam thickness</keyword><keyword>Multi-variant regressional method</keyword><keyword>RIVER ICE</keyword><keyword>STAGE</keyword><keyword>Water level</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1735-1472,1735-2630</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF03326131</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Ice jams can sometimes occur in high latitude rivers during winter and the resulting water level rise may generate costly and dangerous flooding such as the recent ice jam flooding in the Nechako River in downtown Prince George in Canada. Thus, the forecast of water level and ice jam thickness is of great importance. This study compares three methods to simulate and forecast water level and ice jam thickness based on field observations of river ice jams in the Quyu Reach of the Yellow River in China. More specifically, simulation results generated by the traditional multi-variant regressional method are compared to those of the back propagation neural network and the support vector machine methods. The forecast of ice jam thickness and water level under ice jammed condition have been conducted in two different approaches, 1) simulation of water level and ice jam thickness in the second half of the period of measurement using models developed based on data gained during the first half of the period of measurement, 2) simulation of water level and ice jam thickness at the downstream cross sections using models developed based on data gained at the upstream cross sections. For this reason, as the results of simulation and field observations indicated, the back propagation neural network method and the support vector machine method are superior in terms of accuracy to the multi-variant regressional method.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;27 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;28 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, J</author><author>Shi, FY</author><author>Chen, PP</author><author>Wu, P</author><author>Sue, JY</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulations of ice jam thickness distribution in the transverse direction</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF HYDRODYNAMICS</full-title></periodical><pages>762-769</pages><volume>26</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>ACCUMULATION</keyword><keyword>CANADA</keyword><keyword>RELEASE</keyword><keyword>cohesive force</keyword><keyword>FRAZIL ICE</keyword><keyword>HYDRODYNAMICS HYBRID MODEL</keyword><keyword>ice jam thickness</keyword><keyword>RIVER BEND</keyword><keyword>secondary vortex</keyword><keyword>transverse distribution</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1001-6058,1878-0342</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S1001-6058(14)60085-8</electronic-resource-num><abstract>River ice often forms in the cold regions of northern hemisphere which can lead to ice jams (or ice dams). Water level can be significantly raised due to ice jams. As a consequence, disastrous ice flooding may be resulted, such as the ice jam flooding in the Nechako River in Prince George in winter 2007-2008. In the present study, the equations describing the ice jam thickness in the transverse direction are derived. The impact of the secondary vortex is considered while the cohesive force within ice cubes is neglected in the model. The relationship between the parameter beta and the total water depth is established based on the assumption that all other variables except the velocities are kept constant on the same cross section. By using the parameter beta and the developed equations, the ice jam thickness in the transverse direction can be predicted. The developed model is used to simulate the ice jam thickness in the transverse direction at the Hequ Reach of the Yellow River in China. The simulated ice jam thicknesses agree well with the field measurements on different cross sections.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;24</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vore, ME</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Hou, YP</author><author>Wei, XH</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climatic influences on forest fire and mountain pine beetle outbreaks and resulting runoff effects in large watersheds in British Columbia, Canada</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>4560-4575</pages><volume>34</volume><number>24</number><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>DISTURBANCE</keyword><keyword>SPRUCE</keyword><keyword>mountain pine beetle</keyword><keyword>STREAMFLOW</keyword><keyword>SNOW</keyword><keyword>RIVER-BASIN</keyword><keyword>climate</keyword><keyword>runoff</keyword><keyword>WILDFIRE</keyword><keyword>INTERIOR</keyword><keyword>CHANGE IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>DROUGHT</keyword><keyword>forest disturbance</keyword><keyword>forest fires</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087,1099-1085</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.13908</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many studies have defined the interrelationships between climate, forest disturbance, and runoff at small scales (500 km(2)). In this study, we explore the relationship between climate, extreme forest fire seasons, mountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks, and runoff in eight large watersheds within the Fraser and Peace drainage basins in British Columbia (BC), Canada from 1981-2019. Using a climate index based on precipitation and air temperature anomalies, we find extreme forest fire seasons (those that burned &gt;5% of a watershed's area) are most likely to occur when a warm/dry summer is preceded by multiple seasons of cool/wet conditions. Using the climate suitability class (CSC) model to explore the relationship between climate and MPB outbreaks, we validate previous findings that lower-than-average precipitation, warm growing season temperatures, and lack of extremely cold temperatures during winter are connected to MPB outbreaks within central BC. However, the CSC model needs improvements to accurately assess MPB suitability in northern watersheds that are located outside the model's calibration region, either through weighted variables or lower degree day thresholds. Minimal runoff response occurs from these forest disturbances, with the most prominent runoff change being related to the 2014 fire season in the Osilinka and Mesilinka watersheds. The limited effects of forest disturbance on annual runoff are likely related to large watershed sizes, low percentages of disturbed area in some study watersheds and post-MPB forest dynamics. These results provide valuable insight into the interrelationships of climate, forest disturbance and runoff in large Canadian boreal forested watersheds.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;6 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;56</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vondrudloff, E</author><author>Lapp, MS</author><author>McMinn, RG</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chemosystematic studies in the Genus Pinus.5.

Extensive K-Ar dating on the batholith had given relatively reproducible ages centered on 140 Ma, indicating a short life span for magmatic activity However, a combined U-Pb and 40Ar/39Ar study has resulted in a substantial reappraisal of the ape and time span of intrusive activity and its association with molybdenite mineralization. The new data show that the batholith had a protracted emplacement history covering similar to 75 m.y., with clear evidence for periods of magmatic quiescence. The oldest magmatic suite of the Endako batholith, the Stern Creek suite, is dated at similar to 220 Ma and comprises foliated gabbros and diorites. Mafic to intermediate plutons of the Stal: Lake suite range in age from 180 Ma to 161 Ma. The Francois Lake suite is divided into two subsuites: the Glenannan subsuite dated at 157 Ma to similar to 155 Ma and the 149 to 145 Ma Endako subsuite that hosts the Endako molybdenite deposit. 40Ar/39Ar dating of hydrothermal biotite indicates molybdenite mineralization is genetically associated with terminal stages of magmatic activity. Biotite within the mine had its 40Ar/39Ar systematics reset at similar to 145 Ma by hydrothermal fluids with temperatures in excess of 300 degreesC. This resetting is associated with intrusion of the 145.1 +/- 0.2 Ma Casey phase monzogranite, the youngest phase within die Endako subsuite. A further partial resetting of biotite is interpreted to be coeval with Eocene intrusion of the high-level, miarolitic Sam Ross Creek phase and numerous mafic dikes that cut through the region. Hydrothermal fluids associated with this latter event were below biotite closure temperature and do not appear to have any relationship to molybdenite mineralization within the Endako deposit. The new geochronologic data, coupled with detailed mapping, show a general age progression from mafic plutonism at the margins to a central core of high-level granodiorite to monzogranite. The data document the existence of a long-lived, relatively stationary magmatic center. Pulsed magmatism, evident even within individual magmatic suites, may play a major role in concentrating and ultimately depositing molybdenite in some porphyry systems. At Endako, molybdenite would have formed within the higher level portions of the batholith, a position that would normally have rendered the deposit prone to erosional removal.

The Low Pollution Sectors and Conditions (LPSC) method is based on existing measured long-term data sets and is designed for locations where particulate matter (PM) monitors are only influenced by local anthropogenic emission sources from particular wind sectors. The LPSC method combines the analysis of measured hourly meteorological data, PM concentrations, and geographical emission source distributions. PM background levels emerge from measured data for specific wind conditions, where air parcel trajectories measured at a monitoring station are assumed to have passed over geographic sectors with negligible local emissions. Seasonal and annual background levels were estimated for two monitoring stations in Prince George, Canada, and the method was also applied to four other small cities (Burns Lake, Houston, Quesnel, Smithers) in northern British Columbia. The analysis showed reasonable background concentrations for both monitoring stations in Prince George, whereas annual PM10 background concentrations at two of the other locations and PM2.5 background concentrations at one other location were implausibly high. For those locations where the LPSC method was successful, annual background levels ranged between 1.8 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) and 2.5 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 and between 6.3 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3) and 8.5 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3) for PM10. Precipitation effects and patterns of seasonal variability in the estimated background concentrations were detectable for all locations where the method was successful. Overall the method was dependent on the configuration of local geography and sources with respect to the monitoring location, and may fail at some locations and under some conditions. Where applicable, the LPSC method can provide a fast and cost-efficient way to estimate background PM concentrations for small cities in sparsely populated regions like northern British Columbia. Implications: In rural areas like northern British Columbia, particulate matter (PM) monitoring stations are usually located close to emission sources and residential areas in order to assess the PM impact on human health. Thus there is a lack of accurate PM background concentration data that represent PM ambient concentrations in the absence of local emissions. The background calculation method developed in this study uses observed meteorological data as well as local source emission locations and provides annual, seasonal and precipitation-related PM background concentrations that are comparable to literature values for four out of six monitoring stations.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;7 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;31</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vanderkamp, BJ</author><author>Tait, DEN</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variation in disease severity in the Lodgepole Pine-Western gall rust Pathosystem</title><secondary-title>PHYTOPATHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PHYTOPATHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>1269-1277</pages><volume>80</volume><number>12</number><issue>12</issue><keywords><keyword>INFECTION</keyword><keyword>SUSCEPTIBILITY</keyword><keyword>STABILITY</keyword><keyword>ADDITIVE RESISTANCE</keyword><keyword>HORIZONTAL RESISTANCE</keyword><keyword>INCIDENCE SEVERITY RELATIONSHIP</keyword><keyword>MULTIPLICATIVE RESISTANCE</keyword><keyword>NATURAL PATHOSYSTEM</keyword><keyword>NONSPECIFIC RESISTANCE</keyword><keyword>PERIDERMIUM-HARKNESSII</keyword><keyword>PINE STEM RUST</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0031-949X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1094/Phyto-80-1269</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The number of western gall rust (Endocronartium harknessii) infections per tree was measured in a lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) population consisting of 3,215 trees in 20 blocks, established from a single, large seed lot collected and planted near Prince George, B.C.

An extra set of data for trees originating from north of 60 degrees N was also taken at Fort St. John. Each plantation consisted of 40 types of genetic material (i.e., different parentage and latitude of origin), while the extra set at Fort St. John consisted of 17 types of genetic material. The 4357 trees examined had an average of 1.81 gall rust infections per tree, and 49.1% of all trees were infected. Ninety percent of all infections originated in a single year (1990). The number of galls per unit target area declined with increasing height above ground. The percentage of galls located on the hole was 3.10, 10.53, 8.03, and 9.88% for the four populations, respectively. The number of western gall rust infections per tree was linearly related to tree height. The number of infections on boles did not vary with tree height, but the proportion of all infections located on the bole was linearly related to the reciprocal of tree height. The proportion of infections on the hole did not vary significantly with infection severity. Finally, the proportion of galls on the bole did not differ significantly between types of genetic material.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;11 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vandall, TA</author><author>Palmer, HC</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Upper limit of docking time for Stikinia and Terrane-I-Paleomagnetic evidence from the Eocene-Ootsal-Lake-Group, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>212-218</pages><volume>27</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077,1480-3313</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e90-021</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;37</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Duynhoven, A</author><author>Dragicevic, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the Impact of Neighborhood Size on Temporal Convolutional Networks for Modeling Land Cover Change</title><secondary-title>REMOTE SENSING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>REMOTE SENSING</full-title></periodical><volume>14</volume><number>19</number><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>SENSITIVITY</keyword><keyword>PREDICTION</keyword><keyword>CNN</keyword><keyword>CNN-LSTM</keyword><keyword>CNN-TCN</keyword><keyword>convolutional neural networks</keyword><keyword>land cover change</keyword><keyword>long short-term memory</keyword><keyword>neighborhood size effects</keyword><keyword>NEURAL-NETWORK</keyword><keyword>spatiotemporal deep learning</keyword><keyword>temporal convolutional networks</keyword><keyword>temporal deep learning</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2072-4292</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/rs14194957</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Land cover change (LCC) studies are increasingly using deep learning (DL) modeling techniques. Past studies have leveraged temporal or spatiotemporal sequences of historical LC data to forecast changes with DL models. However, these studies do not adequately assess the association between neighborhood size and DL model capability to forecast LCCs, where neighborhood size refers to the spatial extent captured by each data sample. The objectives of this research study were to: (1) evaluate the effect of neighborhood size on the capacity of DL models to forecast LCCs, specifically Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-TCN), and (2) assess the effect of auxiliary spatial variables on model capacity to forecast LCCs. First, each model type and neighborhood setting configuration was assessed using data derived from multitemporal MODIS LC for the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako, Canada, comparing subareas exhibiting different amounts of LCCs with trends obtained for the full region. Next, outcomes were compared with three other study regions. The modeling results were evaluated with three-map comparison measures, where the real-world LC for the next timestep, the real-world LC for the previous timestep, and the forecasted LC for the next year were used to calculate correctly transitioned areas. Across all regions explored, it was observed that increasing neighborhood sizes improved the DL model's capabilities to forecast short-term LCCs. CNN-TCN models forecasted the most correct LCCs for several regions while reducing error due to quantity when provided additional spatial variables. This study contributes to the systematic exploration of neighborhood sizes on selected spatiotemporal DL techniques for geographic applications.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;68</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Umhoefer, PJ</author><author>Rusmore, ME</author><author>WoodsWorth, GJ</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Contrasting Tectono-Stratigraphy and structure in the Coast Belt near Chilko Lake, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF EARTH SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>1700-1713</pages><volume>31</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><keywords><keyword>DEFORMATION</keyword><keyword>CANADIAN CORDILLERA</keyword><keyword>ACCRETION</keyword><keyword>ALEXANDER TERRANE</keyword><keyword>GEOLOGY</keyword><keyword>NORTH-CASCADES</keyword><keyword>OROGENESIS</keyword><keyword>PLUTONIC COMPLEX</keyword><keyword>SUPERTERRANE</keyword><keyword>WASHINGTON</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-4077</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1139/e94-152</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Stratigraphy and structural styles vary greatly in two areas of the Coast Belt near Chilko Lake (Chilcotin Ranges in the east and Coast Mountains in the west). No definite continuity between the two belts has been established in the pre-mid-Cretaceous geology, but this area may be a long-lived, episodic magmatic are and nearby are-related basin. The stratigraphic contrasts may reflect inherent differences between an are and related basinal sequence. Triassic volcanic-are sequences are part of the Stikine (western belt) and Cadwallader (eastern belt) terranes, which may be part of the same are. The Jurassic is represented by one dated pluton in the west compared with almost continuous deposition of volcanogenic elastic rocks in the east. Lower Cretaceous sequences in the west and east may represent a volcanic are and back-are basin. The Taylor Creek Group (Albian) is the first definitive link between the two belts and represents an are and intra-are or back-are basin. The structural evolution of the two belts also differs significantly. The early Late Cretaceous Eastern Waddington thrust belt comprises all major structures in the west, but only has minor expression in the east. Most of the structures in the east are part of the latest Cretaceous(?) to early Tertiary dextral-strike-slip, Yalakom fault system. These differences were most likely caused by the Late Cretaceous change from nearly orthogonal subduction to a dextral-oblique convergent margin.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;5 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;56</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ul Islam, S</author><author>Curry, CL</author><author>Dery, SJ</author><author>Zwiers, FW</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying projected changes in runoff variability and flow regimes of the Fraser River Basin, British Columbia</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES</full-title></periodical><pages>811-828</pages><volume>23</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>NORTH-AMERICA</keyword><keyword>ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS</keyword><keyword>CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS</keyword><keyword>FOREST CHANGE</keyword><keyword>FUTURE CLIMATE</keyword><keyword>LAND-SURFACE WATER</keyword><keyword>REGIONAL-SCALE HYDROLOGY</keyword><keyword>SOIL-MOISTURE</keyword><keyword>VIC-2L MODEL</keyword><keyword>WEST-COAST</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1027-5606,1607-7938</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-23-811-2019</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In response to ongoing and future-projected global warming, mid-latitude, nival river basins are expected to transition from a snowmelt-dominated flow regime to a nival-pluvial one with an earlier spring freshet of reduced magnitude. There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically down-scaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations. Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoff changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin increases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the basin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the anticipated transition from a nival to a nival-pluvial hydrologic regime, the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5 models, providing in-sights for other maritime-influenced extratropical basins.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;12 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;14 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;81</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Turnbull, ND</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Beef production on part-time ranches on interior Plateau of British Columbia</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN FARM ECONOMICS</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN FARM ECONOMICS</full-title></periodical><pages>19-22</pages><volume>4</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1969</year><pub-dates><date>1969</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0008-3518</isbn><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tunnicliffe, J</author><author>Gottesfeld, AS</author><author>Mohamed, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High resolution measurement of bedload transport</title><secondary-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES</full-title></periodical><pages>2631-2643</pages><volume>14</volume><number>15</number><issue>15</issue><keywords><keyword>bedload</keyword><keyword>bedload measurement</keyword><keyword>fluvial geomorphology</keyword><keyword>gravel-bed rivers</keyword><keyword>magnetic detectors</keyword><keyword>RIVER</keyword><keyword>salmon bioturbation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2000</year><pub-dates><date>2000</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0885-6087</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/1099-1085(20001030)14:15&lt;2631::AID-HYP83&gt;3.0.CO;2-C</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A bedload movement detector of novel design was installed in a gravel-bed stream as a component of the ongoing research on sediment transport dynamics in the Stuart-Takla Experimental Watersheds in north-central British Columbia, Canada, The device is designed to collect information on the patterns and timing of bedload transport during a flood event. The device is based on a passive magnetic sensor that produces signals of 10(-2) to 10(-5) V as its magnetic field is disturbed by passing clasts. A series of 82 sensors is housed in an aluminum beam placed across the stream, inserted such that its surface is flush with the gravel bed. The device can be raised or lowered to compensate for bed aggradation and scour. A data acquisition system gathers voltage signals from the sensors at rates of 30 to 100 Hz. This device is sensitive enough to record the movement of most volcanic, metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic clasts larger than a few millimetres. O'Ne-ell Creek watershed is a 68 km(2) tributary basin of the Middle River drainage system in the northern headwaters of the Fraser River. Bedload transport generally occurs twice a year in the Stuart-Takla streams: once during spring floods and again during salmon spawning activity. Bedload moved only during two days in 1998, at the peak of the relatively small nival food in May. Nevertheless, the device detected at least 3 x 10(6) passing clasts. A continuous record of bedload transport was obtained, showing a pulsating pattern of activity seemingly independent of stage, lateral movement of the transport zone, and a sudden onset of bed movement with a tapered cessation. We anticipate that more sophisticated calibration of the sensors and accelerated sampling rates will provide detailed information on the size and/or velocity and magnetic permeability of particles moving over the device, and will contribute to a better understanding of bedload transport.

Design Multisite, prospective, interventional cohort study. Setting Two urban community health centres in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Participants Two hundred sixty-nine HIV-positive patients (18 years of age or older) who received primary care at either of the study sites. Intervention Systematic implementation of the CCM during an 18-month period. Main outcome measures Documented pneumococcal vaccination, documented syphilis screening, documented tuberculosis screening, antiretroviral treatment (ART) status, ART status with undetectable viral load, CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL, and CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL while not taking ART compared during a 36-month period. Results Overall, 35% of participants were women and 59% were aboriginal persons. The mean age was 45 years and most participants had a history of injection drug use that was the presumed route of HIV transmission. During the study follow-up period, 39 people died, and 11 transferred to alternate care providers. Compared with their baseline clinical status, study participants showed statistically significant (P&lt;.001 for all) increases in pneumococcal immunization (54% vs 84%), syphilis screening (56% vs 91%), tuberculosis screening (23% vs 38%), and antiretroviral uptake (47% vs 77%), as well as increased viral load suppression rates among those receiving ART (72% vs 90%). Stable housing at baseline was associated with a 4-fold increased probability of survival. Aboriginal ethnicity was not associated with better or worse outcomes at baseline or at follow-up. Conclusion Application of the CCM approach to HIV care in a marginalized, largely aboriginal patient population led to improved disease screening, immunization, ART uptake, and virologic suppression rates. In addition to addressing underlying social determinants of health, a paradigm shift away from an "infectious disease" approach to a "chronic disease management" approach to HIV care for marginalized populations is strongly recommended.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;21 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;22 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;26</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Trusler, S</author><author>Johnson, LM</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>"Berry patch" as a kind of place - the ethnoecology of black huckleberry in Northwestern Canada</title><secondary-title>HUMAN ECOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>HUMAN ECOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>553-568</pages><volume>36</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>ethnoecology</keyword><keyword>indigenous peoples</keyword><keyword>landscape</keyword><keyword>traditional ecological knowledge</keyword><keyword>traditional resource management</keyword><keyword>Vaccinium membranaceum</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0300-7839,1572-9915</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10745-008-9176-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Gitksan and Wet'suwet'en of Northwestern British Columbia formerly used landscape burning to manage patches of black huckleberry (Vaccinium membranaceum), the most important plant resource of their seasonal round. In view of its significance one might postulate that managed sites would conform to a biophysical or ecological type to maximize return for effort. However, a survey of a number of traditionally managed sites indicated that managed sites are characterized by wide variation in biophysical attributes including elevation, aspect and moisture regime, while proximity to fishing sites, village sites, or sites for harvest of alpine resources proved to be a common factor in known historic berry patch sites. We conclude that characterization of the ideal site type for aboriginal V. membranaceum management must include the economy and social institutions of the local First Nations and requires an enhanced appreciation for the sophistication of the strategies and techniques employed in their management and utilization of the species.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;23 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;60</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tremblay, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Development of design spectra for long-duration ground motions from Cascadia subduction earthquakes</title><secondary-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING</full-title></periodical><pages>1078-1090</pages><volume>25</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>DAMAGE</keyword><keyword>collapse</keyword><keyword>crustal earthquakes</keyword><keyword>damage index</keyword><keyword>design spectrum</keyword><keyword>ductility</keyword><keyword>duration</keyword><keyword>ground motion</keyword><keyword>subduction zone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0315-1468</isbn><abstract>There is now growing evidence that large-magnitude earthquakes have occurred and could occur again along the Cascadia subduction zone located west of Vancouver Island, Bristish Columbia. Numerical simulations indicate that these earthquakes would produce long-duration ground motions and would thus be capable of inducing a large number of reversals of inelastic deformations in engineered structures. Efforts have now been undertaken to account for this damage potential in building codes. In this paper, inelastic design spectra are developed for Cascadia subduction earthquakes for four sites in British Columbia. These spectra are compared with elastic design spectra that have been developed recently for the same sites based on empirical attenuation relationships for Cascadia events. The approach used to develop the inelastic spectra aims at providing the same level of protection against structural failure for both subduction events and crustal or subcrustal earthquakes. Force modification factors are first determined for structures exhibiting various failure modes and ductility levels when subjected to representative crustal and subcrustal earthquake ground motions. Thereafter, design spectra are developed for the same structures to prevent structural collapse under simulated Cascadia subduction ground motions. The study reveals that the elastic spectra do not reflect adequately the damage potential of Cascadia earthquakes. These elastic spectra generally are unconservative for Tofino and Victoria. For Vancouver and Prince George, the elastic spectra overestimate the demand, especially for short-period structures.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;13 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;15</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Topp, SM</author><author>Ogden, LJE</author><author>Martin, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Apparent absence of blood parasites in Winter Wrens in British Columbia</title><secondary-title>JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>JOURNAL OF FIELD ORNITHOLOGY</full-title></periodical><pages>308-313</pages><volume>78</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>British Columbia</keyword><keyword>PREVALENCE</keyword><keyword>INFECTION</keyword><keyword>ECOLOGY</keyword><keyword>birds</keyword><keyword>blood parasite</keyword><keyword>DIPTERA</keyword><keyword>DIURNAL PERIODICITY</keyword><keyword>Haemoproteus</keyword><keyword>HAEMOSPORINA</keyword><keyword>HEMATOZOA</keyword><keyword>HOST-SPECIFICITY</keyword><keyword>ISLAND</keyword><keyword>passerine</keyword><keyword>PLASMODIUM</keyword><keyword>prevalence</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0273-8570,1557-9263</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1557-9263.2007.00120.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>To investigate the possible effect of elevation on the prevalence of hematozoa infection, we collected blood smears from a population of Winter Wrens (Troglogytes troglodytes) in the Coast Mountains of southwestern British Columbia, Canada. We sampled 119 Winter Wrens, including 88 at low elevation (0-500 m) and 31 at high elevation (900-1100 m) sites. In addition, five other species, including Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus; N = 12), Dark-eyed Junco (Junco hyemalis; N=11), Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus; N= 8), Varied Thrush (Ixoreus naevius; N= 4), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius; N= 4), were sampled. No Winter Wrens were infected by blood parasites. Among the other species, Haemoproteus infection was detected in one Varied Thrush (25%) and five Swainson's Thrushes (42%). Thus, despite the occurrence of infection in sympatrically breeding species, blood parasites are apparently absent or occur at extremely low prevalence in Winter Wrens in our study area. The presence of hematozoa in European populations of Winter Wrens, combined with an abundance of vector species in our study area, suggest population-level resistance to infection. Further study is needed to determine the specific mechanisms involved in the apparent lack of infection in our study population.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;1 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;51</research-notes><language>English</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Toomey, P</author><author>Hanlon, N</author><author>Bates, J</author><author>Poole, G</author><author>Lovato, CY</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the role of social capital in supporting a regional medical education campus</title><secondary-title>RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>rural</keyword><keyword>Canada</keyword><keyword>HEALTH</keyword><keyword>medical education</keyword><keyword>Bourdieu</keyword><keyword>INTERVENTIONS</keyword><keyword>medicine</keyword><keyword>remote</keyword><keyword>satellite medical campus</keyword><keyword>social capital</keyword><keyword>social cohesion</keyword><keyword>underserved</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1445-6354</isbn><abstract>Introduction: To help address physician shortages in the underserved community of Prince George, Canada, the University of British Columbia (UBC) and various partners created the Northern Medical Program (NMP), a regional distributed site of UBC's medical doctor undergraduate program. Early research on the impacts of the NMP revealed a high degree of social connectedness. The objective of the present study was to explore the role of social capital in supporting the regional training site and the benefits accrued to a broad range of stakeholders and network partners. Methods: In this qualitative study, 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with community leaders in 2007. A descriptive content analysis based on analytic induction technique was employed. Carpiano's Bourdieu-based framework of 'neighbourhood' social capital was adapted to empirically describe how social capital was produced and mobilized within and among networks during the planning and implementation of the NMP. Results: Results from this study reveal that the operation of social capital and the related concept of social cohesion are multifaceted, and that benefits extend in many directions, resulting in somewhat unanticipated benefits for other key stakeholders and network partners of this medical education program. Participants described four aspects of social capital: (i) social cohesion; ii) social capital resources; (iii) access to social capital; and (iv) outcomes of social capital. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the partnerships and networks formed in the NMP planning and implementation phases were the foundation for social capital mobilization. The use of Carpiano's spatially-bounded model of social capital was useful in this context because it permitted the characterization of relations and networks of a tight-knit community body. The students, faculty and administrators of the NMP have benefitted greatly from access to the social capital mobilized to make the NMP operational. Taking account of the dynamic and multifaceted operation of social capital helps one move beyond a view of geographic communities as simply containers or sinks of capital investment, and to appreciate the degree to which they may act as a platform for productive network formation and expansion.</abstract><research-notes>Times Cited in Web of Science Core Collection:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Total Times Cited:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;4 Cited Reference Count:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;25</research-notes><language>English</language></record></records></xml>
