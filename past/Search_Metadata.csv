First Nations Elders are a unique group and little knowledge currently exists of their preferred forms of social interaction. The objective of this study was to describe the types of programs Nak'azdli Elders desire, identify barriers to participation, and improve creation of programs that address Elders' needs and interests. Methods This project was co-created by the Nak'azdli Health Centre and Elders, located in Northern British Columbia, with support from academic partners when and where asked. An advisory committee selected participants perceived as able to complete the survey and available for interviewing. Participants were interviewed orally in English or Carrier in their homes or at a drop-in centre, by a well-respected Nak'azdli Elder. The Elder entered participant responses (including self-reported health, awareness and utilization for existing programs, and preferences for new programs) into a paper-based survey. Descriptive and content analysis were conducted. Results Nak'azdli Elders (N = 38) were interested in wisdom sharing, social programs, and health-related activities. Elders wanted to be actively engaged in programs/activity selection, helping organize programs, knowledge sharing, skills, and stories. Barriers to participation included lack of transportation, personal health concerns, scheduling conflicts, and lack of knowledge about programs/activities. Conclusion Nak'azdli Elders were interested in culturally relevant programs involving sharing cultural knowledge, teachings, and/or language with younger generations. Elders wanted to be engaged in all stages of activities, including planning, participation, and evaluation. Future programs should prioritize community collaboration and co-creation with Elders.",10.17269/s41997-018-0125-7,2018,2018,[],False,,

Recreational fishing often exploits such mixtures, and estimating the proportional contributions of populations to fisheries promotes more sustainable resource use. Ten DNA microsatellites were assayed in a mixture of bull trout Salvelinus confluentus Suckley overwintering in the Nechako River, upper Fraser River, British Columbia, and in baseline population samples from 14 tributaries putatively contributing to the overwintering mixture. A DNA microsatellite-based mixed-stock fishery analysis suggested that five populations together contributed 0.80 to the mixture. Most of the errors associated with the mixture estimates were attributable to uncertainty in baseline allele frequencies. Radiotracking data confirmed that tributary populations contributing to the mixture estimated by genetic analysis also contained individuals that moved between spawning tributaries and overwintering sites. The results better resolve habitat use by potadromous bull trout in the upper Fraser River and, in combination with assessments of baseline population-specific spawning abundances and productivity, will better inform a decision of whether or not allowing some harvest within the current catch-and-release fishery is biologically sustainable.",10.1111/fme.12473,2021,2021,[],False,,

Gabbro, basalt, dolerites, and foliated clinopyroxene-rich ultramafic rocks are exposed within the Pinchi Fault system. The mid-Permian lavas show affinities of oceanic island tholeiites. Among the Triassic lavas, three types of rocks have been distinguished. Type 1 is geochemically similar to the mid-Permian volcanic rocks. Type 2 differs from type 1 by higher TiO2 abundances and convex rare earth element patterns. Type 3 has the highest Zr, Nb, and Ta abundances and the greatest light rare earth element enrichment. The mafic rocks within the Pinchi Fault system are similar to N-type mid-ocean-ridge basalt (N-MORB), and the foliated ultramafic rocks are characterized by very low trace element contents, similar to extremely depleted harzburgites. Permian lavas and Triassic type 1 and igneous rocks from the Pinchi Fault system have the highest epsilon(Nd(i)) ratios (+7.4 to +9.6) and those of type 3 alkali have the lowest ratios (+2.0 to +5.3). The epsilon(Nd(i)) values of type 2 are intermediate between those of type 1 (similar to +7) and type 3 (similar to +4.9). This suggests that the Triassic rocks generated from a heterogeneous plume source or the mixing between depleted N-MORB and enriched oceanic island basalt sources.

In 2012, 2013, and 2014, three fires burned through high mortality, gray-phase lodgepole pine-dominated forests in the plateau regions of central interior British Columbia, Canada, providing an opportunity to test for interactions between MPB outbreaks and wildfires. We inventoried 63 plots that spanned gradients of outbreak severity, fire severity, and burning conditions in a wilderness setting. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of outbreak severity on fire severity by assessing typical first-order fire effects as well as legacy structure related to the consumption of woody biomass on snags/trees. We found no evidence of a relationship between outbreak severity and fire severity for six of seven first-order fire effects, with the exception of deep charring. We found evidence that legacy structure in the form of consumed branch structure and deep char development had greater odds of occurrence on MPB-killed snags compared to trees killed during wildfire. Our results indicate two key findings. First, fire severity as it relates to most first-order fire effects measures is not influenced by outbreak severity, instead it is more strongly influenced by the interaction of fuels, weather, and topography during fire events. Second, our results highlight how the interaction between outbreak severity and fire severity alters postfire structural legacies and their functional attributes, which could have important ecosystem implications.",10.1002/ecs2.2744,2019,2019,[],False,,

To constrain the subsurface distribution of these Cretaceous rocks, in 2008 Geoscience BC acquired seven long, up to 14.4 km, offset vibroseis seismic reflection lines across a north-northwest-trending belt of exhumed sedimentary rocks inferred to be part of the Taylor Creek Group. P-wave velocity models, which are consistent with sonic logs from nearby wells, have been estimated using three-dimensional first-arrival tomography to depths ranging from 1 to 4 km. Igneous basement can be identified on most lines using the 5.5 km/s isovelocity contour, which locates the top of the basement to an accuracy of similar to 400 m where its depth is known in exploration wells. There is no general distinction on the basis of seismic velocity between Cretaceous sedimentary and Paleocene-Eocene volcanic-volcaniclastic rocks, both of which appear to be characterized in the tomographic models by velocities of 3.0-5.0 km/s. The geometry of the igneous basement inferred from the velocity models identifies north-trending basins and ridges, which correlate with exposed rocks of the Jurassic Hazelton Group. Identified Cretaceous sedimentary rocks occur beneath less negative Bouguer gravity anomalies, but the original distribution of these rocks has been disrupted by later Tertiary extension that created north-trending basins associated with the most negative gravity anomalies. We suggest that Cretaceous sedimentary rocks, if deposited, could be preserved within these basins if the rocks had not been eroded prior to Tertiary extension.",10.1139/cjes-2013-0143,2014,2014,[],False,,

Survival is maximized if the timing of these changes coincides with migration from fresh to marine environments. Therefore, understanding how environmental conditions influence the onset, duration, and termination of smolting can have substantial management implications, particularly for flow-controlled rivers. We used an information-theoretic model comparison analysis to investigate the roles of daily mean temperature, temperature experience (accumulated thermal units [ATU]), photoperiod, and flow on the timing of the downstream migration of Chinook salmon O. tshawytscha smolts from the Nechako River in central British Columbia. Both binary (migration or not) and count (the total number of migrants) models were developed that predicted the downstream migration of Chinook salmon based on data collected from fish captured at rotary-screw traps from 1992 to 2004. The analyses identified a combination of temperature experience, flow, and the number of spawners as best able to describe the observed migration patterns. In addition, increasing ATU had a positive influence on migration, while increasing flow had a negative influence. Temperature experience was found to have more influence on migration than daily mean temperature. The predictive ability of each model was tested with 2 years of independent data. The count model accurately predicted the general trends in migration and, in particular, the termination of migration, but not the daily fluctuations in movement. By contrast, the binary model predicted whether fish would migrate on a given day with accuracies of 93% and 99%, respectively, for the 2 years tested. Temperature experience was more strongly linked to migration than the daily or threshold temperature; warmer temperatures resulted in earlier migration. Our data suggest that flow plays an important role once migration is under way and may even serve as a termination cue. Furthermore, the number of migrants and the probability of migration was positively related to the number of spawners. Based on the results of this study, flow manipulations that change the timing, duration, or magnitude of temperature and flow in the spring could affect the migration of Chinook salmon. Both temperature and river flow should be considered when one is managing flow-controlled watersheds for salmon productivity.",10.1577/T08-180.1,2009,2009,[],False,,

Radiation is usually recommended for patients with invasive breast cancer who have undergone breast conserving surgery. Internationally, there is general agreement that regional nodal radiation is beneficial when four or more nodes are positive, and in BC adjuvant regional nodal radiation also tends to be offered to all patients with any number of positive nodes after both breast conserving surgery and mastectomy. Most patients who are found to be node-negative after mastectomy do not require adjuvant radiation therapy. However, patients at risk because of their young age or the size and biology of their tumors may be candidates for radiation therapy. Because adjuvant radiation therapy is based on pretreatment staging, it is important to accurately determine both the primary and nodal stage, especially in the setting of neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Typically, radiation therapy sessions last 15 to 20 minutes and can be given over 16 to 20 sessions. Patients are monitored regularly during treatment for management of side effects, which can include fatigue, dermatitis, and breast/chest wall tenderness. In the long term there can be permanent cosmetic changes, and rare risks of lung, rib, and heart damage, as well as second malignancies. Before 2012 any patient choosing breast conserving surgery in Northern BC needed to travel to a regional cancer centre in Southern BC for adjuvant radiation therapy. Since the opening of BC Cancer Centre for the North in Prince George on 1 November 2012, patients undergoing breast conserving surgery in Northern BC have been able to receive radiation therapy closer to home, and this appears to be why an increasing number of patients in one surgeon's practice have opted for partial mastectomy and adjuvant radiation rather than mastectomy.",,2018,2018,[],False,,

Relative habitat use, based on counts of fecal pellets and pellet-groups, was similar among the five treatment stands for hares (P = 0.24), deer (P = 0.23), and moose (P = 0.16). However, low-density stands (similar to 500 stems/ha) had ca. 3-20 times as many deer pellet-groups, and ca. 2-4 times as many moose pellet-groups, than other stands. Low-density stands had significantly greater canopy openness, volume of shrubs < 2 m, and horizontal hiding cover < 1.6 m than other treatments. Relative habitat use by deer and moose was positively related to understory characteristics such as enhanced abundance of forage and security cover.

Each study area had three stands thinned to densities of similar to 500 stems/ha (low), similar to 1000 stems/ha (medium), and similar to 2000 stems/ha (high), with an unthinned young pine and old-growth pine stand for comparison. An overall analysis of tree growth in thinned stands, across these regional replicates, indicated that lodgepole pine grew significantly faster in mean diameter in the low- than either of the medium- or high-density stands. There was no difference in mean height growth among stand densities over the 15-year period since PCT. Mean tree volume increment was significantly higher in the low-density than in the high-density stands. Mean stand volume increment (m(3)/ha) was similar in the medium-density (108.53) and high-density (132.51) stands, both of which were significantly higher than the low-density stands (72.88). Mean crown volume of crop trees was significantly greater in the low-density (52.8 m(3)) and medium-density (42.9 m(3)) stands than in the high-density (27.8 m(3)), unthinned (11.7 m(3)), or old-growth stands (30.9 m(3) pine only). This measure of crown size was similar among pine trees in the low-density, medium-density, and all conifers (43.2 m 3) in the old-growth stands. Other measurements of crown architecture followed this same pattern. Mean densities of understory trees were similar among stands for height classes up to 3 m. Mean species diversity and structural diversity of coniferous tree layers were highest in the low- and medium-density stands than in other treatment stands. Our results support the hypotheses that PCT enhances productivity (diameter and volume growth, but not height growth) and structural features (crown architecture) of young lodgepole pine, as well as diversity of coniferous tree layers in thinned stands. Accelerated development of some structural features of late-seral forest appeared in our young managed stands. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

The ice expansion phase occurred during an extended period when glaciers flowed westward to the Pacific Ocean and east-southeastward onto the Nechako Plateau from ice centers in the Skeena, Hazelton, Coast, and Omineca Mountains. Initially, glacier how was confined by topography along major valleys, but eventually piedmont and montane glaciers coalesced to form an integrated glacier system, the Cordilleran ice sheet. In the maximum phase, a Cordilleran ice divide developed over the Nechako Plateau to 300 km inland from the Pacific coast. At this time, the surface of the ice sheet extended well above 2500 m above sea level, and flowed westward over the Skeena, Hazelton, and Coast Mountains onto the continental shelf and eastward across the Rocky Mountains into Alberta. In the late glacial phase, a rapid rise of the equilibrium line caused ice lobes to stagnate in valleys, and restricted accumulation centers to high mountains. Discordant directions in ice how are attributed to fluctuations of the ice divide representing changes in the location of accumulation centers and ice thickness. Ice centers probably shifted in response to climate, irregular growth in the ice sheet, rapid calving, ice streaming, and drainage of proglacial and subglacial mater bodies. Crosscutting ice-flow indicators and preservation of early (valley parallel) flow features in areas exposed to later (cross-valley) glacier erosion indicate that the ice expansion phase was the most erosive and protracted event.",10.1130/0016-7606(2000)112<1850:MFOTLW>2.0.CO;2,2000,2000,[],False,,

The objective of three held experiments, conducted at the Prince George experimental farm, was to evaluate management practices that might accommodate the growth of lucerne on acid soils without the expense of liming. Experiment 1 compared three legume species (lucerne, alsike clover (Trifolium hybridum L.) and red clover (T. pratense L.)), preinoculated lime-coated seed (GNR(TM), Grow Tec Ltd, Nisku, Alberta), and soil liming on root nodulation and forage dry matter (DM) yield. Experiment 2 compared lucerne genetic lines, seed preinoculation and soil liming on root nodulation and forage DM yield and percentage CP. Experiment 3 compared lucerne rhizobia genetic strains, seed preinoculation and soil liming on root nodulation, forage DM yield and percentage CP. For effective nodulation, lucerne required seed preinoculation, whereas alsike clover and red clover did not. Lucerne persisted longer than alsike or red clover. In Expts 2 and 3, the combination of lime and preinoculation increased lucerne DM yield by 136% and %CP from 9.2 to 15.4. The addition of lime alone increased lucerne DM yield by an average of 130% and %CP from 9.2 to 16.3. With preinoculation alone, lucerne DM yield increased by 100% and %CP increased from 9.2 to 12.7. Although using preinoculated lime-coated seed alone is not as effective as lime alone, coated seed may be the preferred method, based on ease of application and cost. Neither the six lucerne lines nor the three rhizobial strains evaluated resulted in improved root nodulation under acidic conditions.",10.1017/S0021859696003905,1997,1997,[],False,,

This study examined if aftereffects are present in white spruce (Picea glauca (Moench) Voss). Control pollinations were made at two locations, Red Rock, near Prince George (53 degrees N) in central British Columbia, and Kalamalka, near Vernon (50 degrees N) in southern British Columbia, on five female trees using a four-male polymix. Identical genotypes through grafting were present at the two locations. Pollen maturing at each site was only used in the polymix at that particular location. Progeny were raised and germination traits, number of needle primordia, greenhouse and field heights, and frost hardiness were evaluated in a common environment.

Part of the seismic profile crossed the Nechako Basin, a Jurassic-Cretaceous basin with potential for hydrocarbons within sedimentary strata that underlies widespread volcanic rocks. Along this 205 km-long line segment, eight large explosive shots were fired into 980 seismometers. Forward and inverse modelling of the traveltime data were conducted with two independent methods: ray-tracing based modelling of first and secondary arrivals, and a higher resolution wavefront-based first-arrival seismic tomography. Material with velocities less than 5.0 km/s is interpreted as sedimentary rocks of the Nechako Basin, while velocities from 5.0-6.0 km/s may correspond to interlayered sedimentary and volcanic rocks. The greatest thickness of sedimentary rocks in the basin is found in the central 110 km of the profile. Two sub-basins were identified in this region, with widths of 20-50 km and maximum sedimentary depths of 2.5 and 3.3 km. Such features are well-defined in the velocity model, since resolution tests indicate that features with widths greater than similar to 13 km are reliable. Beneath the sedimentary rocks, seismic velocities increase more slowly with depth - from 6.0 km/s just below the basin to 6.3 km/s at similar to 17 km in depth, and then to 6.8-7.0 km/s at the base of the crust.

Departures from a 1-D response occur with maximum phase differences occurring between 0.1 and 10 s. The upper crustal resistivity models reveal a low resistivity layer at near surface depths, interpreted as Chilcotin basalts, that blankets portions of the region to depths less than 50 m, but locally thicken up to 200 m. Cretaceous sedimentary units (those showing the highest potential for hydrocarbons) are characterized by moderately low resistivities that are laterally variable. More uniform, lower resistivities appear to be associated with the Eocene volcaniclastic groups, suggesting that the MT method can distinguish between these units and may be useful in targeting areas that are more prospective for hydrocarbon exploration. In general midcrustal resistivity values are high, consistent with values of typical volcanic terranes; however, a low-resistivity zone is identified at 8-10 km depth that correlates closely with the location of seismic reflectors as well as recent microseismic activity.

We sought to estimate time to HCV infection and the relative hazard of risk factors associated HCV infection among young Aboriginal people who use injection drugs in two Canadian cities. Methods: The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants' venous blood samples were drawn and tested for HCV antibodies. Analysis was restricted to participants who use used injection drugs at enrolment or any of follow up visit. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify independent predictors of time to HCV seroconversion. Results: In total, 45 out of 148 participants seroconverted over the study period. Incidence of HCV infection was 26.3 per 100 person-years (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 16.3, 46.1) among participants who reported using injection drugs for two years or less, 14.4 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 7.7, 28.9) among participants who had been using injection drugs for between two and five years, and 5.1 per 100 person-years (95% CI: 2.6,10.9) among participants who had been using injection drugs for over five years.

Whereas the majority of infections are related to injection drug use, factors that explain elevated risk and transmission of HIV among Aboriginal young people who use illicit drugs are not well understood. Study design. Observational study. Methods. The Cedar Project is an observational study of Aboriginal youth living in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Eligibility criteria include age (14-30 years) and self-reported use of non-injection or injection drugs at least once in the month before enrolment. Between October 2003 and April 2005, 512 participants were recruited and completed a questionnaire administered by an Aboriginal interviewer. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to model the independent association of demographic and behavioural variables of individuals with HIV infection. Results. Of the participants, 235 resided in Prince George and 277 in Vancouver. Among the 276 participants that used injection drugs, HIV prevalence was significantly higher in Vancouver (17% vs. 7%) but HCV prevalence was higher in Prince George (62% vs. 57%). In Vancouver, 40% of injectors reported daily heroine use compared with 12% in Prince George. In contrast, Prince George participants were more likely to report daily injection of cocaine compared with those in Vancouver (37% vs. 21%). A higher percentage of Prince George participants reported having difficulty accessing clean syringes (22% vs. 8%).

We use constrained 3D traveltime inversion followed by 2D full-waveform inversion to process long-offset (14.4 km) first-arrival refraction waveforms, resulting in a velocity model of significantly higher detail than a conventional refraction-statics model generated for a processing workflow. The crooked-line acquisition of the data set makes 2D full-waveform inversion difficult. Thus, a procedure that improves the tractability of waveform tomography processing of vibroseis data recorded on crooked roads is developed to generate a near-surface (< 2 km) velocity model for the study area. The data waveforms are first static corrected using a time shift determined by 3D raytracing, which accounts for the crossline offsets produced by the crooked-line acquisition. The velocity model generated from waveform tomography exhibits substantial improvement when compared with a conventional refraction-statics model. It also shows improved resolution of sharp discontinuities and low-velocity regions when compared to the model from traveltime tomography alone, especially in regions where the geometry errors are moderate. Interpretation of the near-surface velocity model indicates possible subbasins in the Nechako Basin and delineates the Eocene volcanic rocks of the study area. This approach limits the ability of the full-waveform inversion to fit some propagation modes; however, the tractability of the inversion in the near-surface region is improved.

First-arrival travel time tomography is applied using a 3D method, but with constraints on the intermediate 3D velocity model; the result is the starting model for the next step. A 2.5D frequency-domain full-waveform inversion stage parameterizes 3D geometry in the seismic source and receiver arrays, with the assumption that the velocity and attenuation models are homogeneous in the out-of-plane direction. This approach results in superior results compared to a strictly 2D approach when the acquisition line is crooked, with a moderate increase in computational cost. A case study using data acquired in the Nechako Basin in south-central British Columbia, Canada, exemplifies and validates the procedure. The velocity model derived from 2.5D waveform tomography is compared with that from a previous study in which 2D waveform tomography was applied to the same data set and with results from 3D travel time tomography. The resolution and accuracy of the velocity model from 2.5D waveform tomography are demonstrated to be greater than those from travel time or 2D waveform tomography. A model of viscoacoustic attenuation, which was not possible in the 2D case, is also generated. These models are interpreted jointly to highlight features of geological interest, such as a sedimentary basin, basement rocks, and faults, from surface to about 3km depth.",10.1002/jgrb.50100,2013,2013,[],False,,

Molybdenite mineralization and hydrothermal alteration occur as early quartz +/- molydenite stockwork veins with K feldspar-bearing salvages and paragenetically later quartz-molybdenite ribbon veins with sericite-bearing selvages. Late hydrothermal alteration is associated with the development of kaolinite and postore (Tertiary age) calcite veins. Fluid inclusions in early-formed quartz +/- molybdenite stockwork veins with K feldspar-bearing alteration assemblages are dominated by moderate salinity (5 to 15 wt % NaCl equiv), liquid-rich (type 1) and rare high-salinity (30 to 45 wt % NaCl equiv), halite-bearing (type 3) fluid inclusions. Type 1 and type 3 fluid inclusions in early veins homogenize between 390 degrees and 430 degrees C and 375 degrees and 420 degrees C, respectively. Secondary fluid inclusions (type 2) of low salinity (1 to 5 wt % NaCl equiv) in these early veins are minor, and homogenize between 130 degrees and 285 degrees C. Fluid inclusions in quartz-molybdenite ribbon veins with sericite-bearing alteration assemblages are dominated by moderate-salinity, liquid-rich (type 1) inclusions, with minor type 2 fluid inclusions. Type 1 fluid inclusions of ribbon veins homogenize between 360 degrees and 400 degrees C. Fluid inclusions in postore cal cite veins are of only type 2 fluid inclusions, which homogenize at 209 degrees C. Hydrothermal fluids recorded by type I and type 3 fluid inclusions in early veins were trapped under lithostatic to hydrostatic conditions between 0.3 and less than or equal to 2.0 kbar, and 360 degrees and 560 degrees C. Postore fluids recorded by type 2 fluid inclusions were trapped under conditions less than or equal to 0.5 kbar, and between 190 degrees and 300 degrees C. Quartz stockwork and ribbon Veins possess delta(18)O values of 8.4 +/- 0.2 (n = 9) and 8.4 +/- 0.6 (n = 13), respectively. Hydrothermal K feldspar and biotite from K feldspar alteration assemblages possess delta(18)O values of 6.8 +/- 0.4 (n = 7) and 3.5 +/- 0.8 (n = 8), respectively. Oxygen isotope geothermometry of quartz-biotite and quartz-K feldspar pairs from K feldspar alteration assemblages yield temperatures between 200 degrees and 490 degrees C, which is similar to the trapping temperatures of hydrothermal fluids determined from fluid inclusion studies associated with molybdenite mineralization, the development of kaolinite, and calcite veins. The oxygen isotope temperatures of the quartz-biotite and quartz-K feldspar pairs suggest that K feldspar and biotite either record the approximate O-18 composition of hydrothermal fluids associated with K feldspar alteration or have undergone O-18 exchange with late-stage hydrothermal fluids. Hydrogen isotope composition of quartz stockwork and ribbon veins fluid inclusion waters range between -105 and -113 per mil. Solute chemistry studies of fluid inclusion waters indicate that ore forming fluids from Endako have low Br/Cl and Br/Na ratios, and high I/Cl and I/Br ratios in comparison to Porgera (epithermal), Babine Lake (porphyry Cu), and St. Austell, Capitan Pluton (vein) deposits associated with magmatic processes.

In Canada, Airport Wildlife Management Plans (AWMPs) are designed to provide an outline of specific wildlife hazards at airports and recommend countermeasures to minimise strike risk. Wildlife incident reports are a key component in the development of such plans. Here, wildlife incident reports were compiled and compared to data collected using newly-installed digital wildlife camera trap technology at the Prince George International Airport. Seven camera traps were monitored for a total of 2,426 sampling days (9,228 camera days) between 2009 and 2016 and recorded a total of 3,046 animals within 16 different animal species/groups. Airport personnel recorded 4,640 animals and 23 different species/ groups during the same period. Camera traps recorded almost five times as many animals (n = 2,525) on days when no wildlife incident reports were filed than days when wildlife incident reports were filed (n = 521) and camera traps recorded no images. Z-test for proportions analyses indicated that birds (ie flocks) were more commonly observed and reported by airport personnel than were captured by camera traps, while mammals such as moose (Alces alces), black bears (Ursus americanus) and snowshoe hares (Lepus americanus) were more commonly recorded by camera traps.

However, it displays a few significant limitations for hydrologic forecasting, such as the inability to distinguish dry snow from wet snow, which could be addressed by the use of a technology such as synthetic aperture radar (SAR). This study is based on the Nechako River basin, located in the Coast Mountains of British Columbia (Canada), where the snowpack can reach several meters in depth. Fifteen RADARSAT-2 ScanSAR Wide images were obtained in VV + VH polarization between the months of March and July 2012 and sixteen SENTINEL-1A IW images were obtained in W polarization between the months of February and June 2015. They were processed with an algorithm based on Nagler and Rott's methodology, but which employs a soft threshold to separate wet snow from dry snow instead of the -3 dB hard threshold used in their method. The wet snow probability maps from this technique correspond better to the uncertainties caused by the coniferous forest found throughout the river basin. They were combined with the MODIS snow-covered area (SCA) product to exploit its ability to accurately detect the snow cover extent. The wet snow probability was also cross-referenced with the MODIS SCA product to remove discrepancies caused by forested areas or waterlogged soil. When compared to the snow metamorphism model SURFEX-Crocus at the location of the snow pillows of the basin, the combined product improves the detection of snow from 81.7 to 915% compared to MODIS alone. It also reliably distinguishes wet snow, dry snow, and snow free conditions with an accuracy of 77.6%. Moreover, an agreement of 72.4% was established between this product and the MODIS Land Surface Temperature. As an example of the future application of this work for watershed management, the current dataset was used to successfully detect snowmelt and predict the peak inflow occurrence in the Nechako reservoir for the 2012 and 2015 winters.

Continuous centerline acoustic Doppler current profiler survey and observations of bedrock confinement, supplemented with measurements on air photos, reveal the influence of bedrock on channel properties. The surveyed reach was subdivided into 10 morphological reaches, ranging from dominance by alluvial gravel-bed channels to dominantly rock-walled canyons. Measured data were grouped within each reach based on the presence of bedrock on both banks, one bank, or neither bank. From alluvial to mixed to canyon-dominated reaches, river widths decreased while water depths, flow velocities, water surface slopes, and bed shear stresses increased. Within reaches, subreaches with bedrock on both banks were narrower and deeper with higher bed shear stresses but, at the observed stage, had lower depth-averaged velocity and water surface slope than partly confined and alluvial (unconfined) subreaches. A conceptual model is presented representing a bedrock river as an alternating series of relatively low gradient, deep, rock-walled pools and steep semialluvial or alluvial sections. Downstream hydraulic geometry relations have scaling exponents expected for alluvial channels provided that the alluvial and rock-influenced sections are analyzed separately. In Fraser River, canyons become relatively narrower downstream, apparently in response to increasing rock uplift during the Quaternary period. The observations are compared against prior semitheoretical frameworks established to explain variations in width, slope, and channel shape along rockbound channels. Plain Language Summary Using data derived from a 524-km traverse of the canyon-infested Fraser River, British Columbia, we learned that the rock-walled canyons, which occupy only 16% of the total distance, are steeper and narrower than the rest of the river but, surprisingly, have lower water velocity and lower slope. So how do the canyons manage to transport all the sediment fed into them and remain rockbound? They maintain higher sediment mobilizing forces on the bed because the maximum flow velocity plunges to near the bed as the flow is squeezed into the narrow canyon. Despite this effect, the canyons maintain the overall scaling relations for width, depth, and flow expected in rivers that are not rockbound. We also detected an effect of recent rock uplift whereby the reaches subject to greater uplift are relatively narrower as the river focuses all erosive energy on downcutting to maintain its course over the uplifted reach.",10.1029/2017JF004458,2018,2018,[],False,,

To determine how vegetation management in transportation (road and rail) corridors at different times of the year could influence browse quality in the years following cutting, and how this could potentially influence encounters between herbivores and vehicles, we undertook a 3-year study. In 2001, at a wildlife viewing area near Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, we established a control area and treatment areas where shrubs and trees that are used as food by moose (Alces alces) were cut at the beginning of June, July, August, September, and October. In the fall, moose were most often observed browsing the resprouts of plants cut in August (years 1 and 2 post-treatment) and September (year 3). Cumulative winter track counts were highest in the uncut control area in the years following cutting. Spring pellet counts revealed that most pellets were deposited in the uncut (years 1 and 2) and August-cut (year 3) areas during winter. With the exception of the first year after cutting, browse removal by moose was highest for plants cut later in the growing season. Overall, our findings suggest that following cutting, plants cut later in the year are selected more often by moose relative to those cut earlier. To reduce browse use of corridor vegetation in areas where concerns for moose-vehicle collisions exist, we recommend that vegetation maintenance activities be conducted in the early summer months of June and July.",10.1007/s00267-010-9502-6,2010,2010,[],False,,

A key uncertainty is whether those wildlife species associated with these structural characteristics will respond positively to their development in thinned young seral forests. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that population dynamics (abundance, breeding condition, and survival) of northern flying squirrels (Glaucomys sabrinus) and red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) would be maintained at levels recorded in old-growth forests by large-scale pre-commercial thinning of young (17-27 years old) lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests. Replicated study areas were located near Penticton, Kamloops, and Prince George in south-central British Columbia, Canada. Each study area had three young pine stands thinned to densities of similar to500 (low), similar to1000 (medium), and similar to2000 (high) stems/ha, with unthinned (4300-7600 stems/ha) and old-growth stands for comparison. Populations of G. sabrinus and T. hudsonicus were sampled intensively from 2000 to 2002 corresponding to 12-14 years after thinning. Abundance of G. sabrinus was significantly higher in the high-density stand and lowest in the low-density and unthinned stands. Intermediate densities were found in the medium-density and old-growth stands. Adult male body mass was significantly greater in old-growth than high-density stands. We failed to detect significant differences among treatments for recruitment, movement, and survival for G. sabrinus and all parameters measured for T. hudsonicus. Survival increased significantly in 2002 from previous years for G. sabrinus, while survival decreased significantly for T. hudsonicus during this period.

We found a significant difference between the populations, with the western birds responding more strongly overall than the eastern birds, and males in both populations responding more strongly to the doublet-ending song type.

We studied the current state and potential causes of fragmentation in grizzly bears over approximately 1,000,000 km(2) of western Canada, the northern United States (US), and southeast Alaska. We compiled much of our data from projects undertaken with a variety of research objectives including population estimation and trend, landscape fragmentation, habitat selection, vital rates, and response to human development. Our primary analytical techniques stemmed from genetic analysis of 3,134 bears, supplemented with radiotelemetry data from 792 bears. We used 15 locus microsatellite data coupled with measures of genetic distance, isolation-by-distance (IBD) analysis, analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), linear multiple regression, multi-factorial correspondence analysis (to identify population divisions or fractures with no a priori assumption of group membership), and population-assignment methods to detect individual migrants between immediately adjacent areas. These data corroborated observations of inter-area movements from our telemetry database. In northern areas, we found a spatial genetic pattern of IBD, although there was evidence of natural fragmentation from the rugged heavily glaciated coast mountains of British Columbia (BC) and the Yukon. These results contrasted with the spatial pattern of fragmentation in more southern parts of their distribution. Near the Canada-US border area, we found extensive fragmentation that corresponded to settled mountain valleys and major highways. Genetic distances across developed valleys were elevated relative to those across undeveloped valleys in central and northern BC. In disturbed areas, most inter-area movements detected were made by male bears, with few female migrants identified. Northsouth movements within mountain ranges (Mts) and across BC Highway 3 were more common than eastwest movements across settled mountain valleys separating Mts. Our results suggest that relatively distinct subpopulations exist in this region, including the Cabinet, Selkirk South, and the decades-isolated Yellowstone populations. Current movement rates do not appear sufficient to consider the subpopulations we identify along the Canada-US border as 1 inter-breeding unit. Although we detected enough male movement to mediate gene flow, the current low rate of female movement detected among areas is insufficient to provide a demographic rescue effect between areas in the immediate future (0-15 yr). In Alberta, we found fragmentation corresponded to major eastwest highways (Highways 3, 11, 16, and 43) and most inter-area movements were made by males. Gene flow and movement rates between Alberta and BC were highest across the Continental Divide south of Highway 1 and north of Highway 16. In the central region between Highways 1 and 11, we found evidence of natural fragmentation associated with the extensive glaciers and icefields along the Continental Divide. The discontinuities that we identified would form appropriate boundaries for management units. We related sex-specific movement rates between adjacent areas to several metrics of human use (highway traffic, settlement, and human-caused mortality) to understand the causes of fragmentation. This analysis used data from 1,508 bears sampled over a 161,500-km(2) area in southeastern BC, western Alberta, northern Idaho, and northern Montana during 1979-2007. This area was bisected by numerous humantransportation and settlement corridors of varying intensity and complexity. We used multiple linear regression and ANCOVA to document the responses of female and male bears to disturbance. Males and females both demonstrated reduced movement rates with increasing settlement and traffic. However, females reduced their movement rates dramatically when settlement increased to >20% of the fracture zone. At this same threshold, male movement declined more gradually, in response to increased traffic and further settlement. In highly settled areas (>50%), both sexes had a similar reduction in movements in response to traffic, settlement, and mortality. We documented several small bear populations with male-only immigration, highlighting the importance of investigating sex-specific movements. Without female connectivity, small populations are not viable over the long term. The persistence of this regional female fragmented metapopulation likely will require strategic connectivity management. We therefore recommend enhancing female connectivity among fractured areas by securing linkage-zone habitat appropriate for female dispersal, and ensuring current large source subpopulations remain intact. The fragmentation we documented may also affect other species with similar ecological characteristics: sparse densities, slow reproduction, short male-biased dispersal, and a susceptibility to human-caused mortality and habitat degradation. Therefore, regional inter-jurisdictional efforts to manage broad landscapes for inter-area movement will likely benefit a broad spectrum of species and natural processes, particularly in light of climate change.

The forest-management practices necessary to conserve caribou differ substantially between these two categories of animals with different life-history strategies. Because of this variability in winter-habitat use, information relating specifically to Takla Lake caribou was required for forest management. To provide this information, we radio-collared 15 female caribou in two subherds in the vicinity of Takla Lake and determined their distribution and movements between January 1996 and May 1998 in relation to topography and vegetation cover. Habitat selection was examined using a classified satellite image. At the landscape scale, Takla Lake caribou avoided low-elevation forests (presumably because of the associated high risk of predation from wolves (Canis lupus)), occupying small seasonally overlapping home ranges (mean 151 km(2)) at intermediate and high elevations. Within home ranges in all seasons, caribou were most often found in the forest but, relative to availability, they selected forests only during calving. When in the forest, caribou selected open hybrid white-Engelmann spruce (Picea glauca x Picea engelmannii) - subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) forests over lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and deciduous forests in all seasons except spring. Caribou selected open spruce-fir stands over dry and closed spruce-fir stands in all seasons except calving. We conclude that caribou feed primarily on arboreal lichens in winter, because the open spruce-fir forests that they use have moderate to high arboreal lichen abundance, deep snow, and few terrestrial lichens. Takla Lake caribou were not typical of either mountain or northern caribou, but as is typical of insular populations of any species, have adapted to the food, topography, and cover types available to them on their mountain islands in a sea of moose (Alces alces) and wolves.",10.1139/cjz-78-9-1552,2000,2000,[],False,,

Existing regional climatic studies show a clear warming trend over the last century and a projected mean temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C for the 2050s. Watershed stakeholders determined that hydroelectric development and forestry activities interrelate particularly closely with climate impacts related to ecosystem function, water supply, and (resultantly) community well-being. Mining and oil and gas development do not currently represent a high level of concern, but will become problematic with future resource exploitation or climatic changes. The process was effective in grounding specific, day-to-day realities of climate change. The results illustrate the importance and challenge of considering both impact sources in tandem, and should inform ongoing regional planning and monitoring efforts.

This northern interior town has a population of 3,000 people, almost equally divided between First Nations (indigenous) and non-Native Canadians, the latter constituting the ‘settler society’. The first anecdote reported a kind of ‘High Noon’ conflict between the municipality of Burns Lake and one of the First Nations bands, the Burns Lake Band (whose preferred name is Ts’il Kaz Koh First Nation). As part of a dispute over land and taxation which culminated in the year 2000, the municipality shut off water and sewer services to the Burns Lake Band’s Reserve, in the middle of winter (in a region where winter temperatures in February are typically -30°C). To our then innocent ears that seemed like a pretty shocking situation. How could there be such an apparent affront to basic human rights, we wondered, in twenty-first-century Canada, a country with a rather stellar record of defending human rights abroad? How could such injustice and seemingly blatant racism be happening and how could the perpetrator be an arm of the state, namely, local government?. The second anecdote told how in 2005 some of the local youth in the town had gotten together, Native and non-Native, and written and performed a song about racism and violence in the town, calling their song ‘Leave it Behind’. This raised a second question of whether and how, amid a history of segregation and conflict, some people were struggling to change things, and how well were they faring? And, third, we learned that in the municipal elections of 2005 a member of the Burns Lake Band had been elected to the Village Council, the only Native person ever to serve on that Council. What effect would this have on local politics? Was the local power structure changing or were there more subtle shifts in power occurring, and, if so, how and why? And what potential effect might our research have in aiding this shift towards more equitable economic, social and political relations between Native and non-Native Canadians in this town, and possibly beyond, through the power of their story? These were the questions that prompted us to make an exploratory trip to the town in the summer of 2006.",,2012,2012-01-01,[],False,,

We introduce several perspectives on land rooted in diverse Indigenous worldviews and contrast them with settler colonial perspectives rooted in Eurocentric worldviews. We then examine several examples in Canada where Indigenous nations attempt to reconnect with their homelands, protect them, and/or engage with them for economic development. We look at land relationships rooted in historical treaties, contemporary comprehensive claims/self-government agreements, the Indian Act, and the defence of unceded territories. The Indigenous communities we look at include the Six Nations of the Grand River, the Nisga'a Lisims Government, the Westbank First Nation, and the Wet'suwet'en.

Time histories are simulated for the following cities: Halifax, La Malbaie, Quebec, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Prince George, Tofino, Vancouver, and Victoria. The target UHS for the time history simulations are the GSC 5% damped horizontal-component spectra for ""firm ground"" (Class B) sites for an annual probability of 1/500. The Canadian Council on Earthquake Engineering is currently considering the adoption of these maps as the seismological basis for the earthquake design requirements for future editions of the National Building Code of Canada. It is therefore useful to have compatible time histories for these spectra, in order that dynamic analysis methods requiring the use of time histories can be employed. The simulated records provide a realistic representation of ground motion for the earthquake magnitudes and distances that contribute most strongly to hazard at the selected cities and probability level. For each selected city, two horizontal components are generated for a moderate earthquake nearby, and two horizontal components are generated for a larger earthquake farther away. These records match the short- and long-period ends of the target UHS, respectively. These simulations for local and regional crustal earthquakes are based on a point-source stochastic simulation procedure. For cities in British Columbia, records are also simulated for a scenario M8.5 earthquake on the Cascadia subduction zone, using a stochastic finite-fault simulation model. Four different rupture scenarios are considered. The ground motions for this scenario event are not associated with a specific probability level, but current information suggests that their probability of occurrence is comparable to that of the 1/500 UHS (the probabilistic analyses performed for the national hazard maps do not explicitly include the Cascadia subduction event). Thus it would be reasonable to conduct engineering analyses for cities in British Columbia using both the simulated crustal-event motions and the simulated Cascadia-event motions for the Cascadia event.

Similar to the heat shock response, increased immune defence-related responses were also observed after warm temperature treatment and with a swimming challenge in two different populations (Chilko and Nechako), but with some important differences. Microarray analyses revealed that 347 genes were differentially expressed between the cold (12-13 degrees C) and warm (18-19 degrees C) treated fish, with stress response (GO:0006950) and response to fungus (GO:0009620) elevated with warm treatment, while expression for genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (GO:0006119) and electron transport chain (GO:0022900) elevated for cold-treated fish. Analysis of single genes with real-time quantitative PCR revealed that temperature had the most significant effect on mRNA expression levels, with swimming and population having secondary influences. Warm temperature treatment for the Chilko population induced expression of heat shock protein (hsp) 90, hsp90 and hsp30 as well as interferon-inducible protein. The Nechako population, which is known to have a narrower thermal tolerance window than the Chilko population, showed even more pronounced stress responses to the warm treatment and there was significant interaction between population and temperature treatment for hsp90 expression. Moreover, significant interactions were noted between temperature treatment and swimming challenge for hsp90 and hsp30, and while swimming challenge alone increased expression of these hsps, the expression levels were significantly elevated in warm-treated fish swum to exhaustion. In conclusion, it seems that adult O. nerka currently encounter conditions that induce several cellular defence mechanisms during their once-in-the-lifetime migration. As river temperatures continue to increase, it remains to be seen whether or not these cellular defences provide sufficient protection for all O. nerka populations.",10.1111/jfb.12367,2014,2014,[],False,,

A secondary HYSPLIT evaluation is performed using aerial surveys taken during the following summer (2006), which identify the previous years' beetle-infested regions. Beetle flight distances from the time of beetle emergence to the time of peak clear-air returns are calculated for each trajectory, and the distribution of all flight distances is presented. The mean back trajectory distance is 20.2 km with a standard deviation of 13.6 km. These values represent the MPB flight distance during half of the beetle atmospheric residence time, and typical daily wind-assisted dispersion distances would be expected to be roughly double this value. Mean beetle residence time in the atmosphere over the 10 emergence events is found to be 3.2 h.",10.1007/s10453-010-9176-9,2011,2011,[],False,,

The analysis uses the CALPUFF atmospheric dispersion model to identify safe burning regions based on atmospheric stability and wind direction. Model results show that the location and extent of influence regions is sensitive to wind speed, wind direction, atmospheric stability and a threshold used to quantify excessive concentrations. A concentration threshold based on the Canada Wide PM2.5 Standard is used to delineate the influence regions while Environment Canada's (EC) daily ventilation index (VI) is used to quantify local atmospheric stability. Results from the analysis, to be used by air quality meteorologists in assessing daily requests for burning permits, are presented as a series of maps delineating acceptable burning locations for sources placed at various distances from the city center and under different ventilation conditions. The results show that no burning should be allowed within 10 km of the city center; under poor ventilation conditions, no burning should be allowed within 20 km of the city center; under good ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed within 10-15 km of the city center; under good to fair ventilation conditions, burning can be allowed beyond 15 km of the city center; and if the wind direction can be reliably forecast, burning can be allowed between 5 and 10 km downwind of the city center under good ventilation conditions.

Governmental conduct of Indigenous relations was further guided by Article 13 of the Terms of Union Act, which committed the Dominion to ""a policy as liberal as that hitherto pursued"" by colonial governments, supported by a concomitant provincial obligation for periodic transfer of public lands to the Dominion in pursuit of that goal.6 Those arrangements quickly brought competing provincial and federal approaches to ""the Indian land question"" into overt conflict. The Cheslatta and Ingenika bands were both abruptly uprooted from their homes and reserve lands by the Kemano and W.A.C.

These forward simulations are commonly based on ""best-fit"" parameter estimates of the Ricker stock-recruitment relationship, despite the fact that such estimates are often highly uncertain. To examine if explicitly accounting for parameter uncertainty using Bayesian methods would affect the results of forward simulations, we compared simulations based on best-fit Ricker parameters to simulations where parameter uncertainty was incorporated through a Bayesian formulation with noninformative priors. Forward simulations using fixed harvest rates were conducted using data for two stocks of Fraser River sockeye (O. nerka) salmon. We found that expected values of spawner and recruit projections for the Bayesian simulations were consistently larger than projections for the best-fit case. Increases in the Bayes projections over those of the best-fit case typically ranged from 5 to 15% for the Stellako stock, and 20 to 60% for the Late Stuart stock. However, these differences were largely attributable to low values of the Ricker beta parameter that were included in the Bayesian prior distribution. Results of Bayesian simulations were found to be highly sensitive to changes in the lower bound of the prior on beta. We conclude that the common approach of specifying noninformative priors by extending uniform distributions across a broad range of parameter values can be inappropriate for the Ricker model, and recommend the use of informative priors whenever possible.",,1998,1998,[],False,FISHERY STOCK ASSESSMENT MODELS,

Two climate simulations of western Canada (WCan) were conducted with the Canadian Regional Climate Model (version 4) at 15 (CRCM15) and 45km (CRCM45) horizontal resolution driven at the lateral boundaries by global reanalysis over the period 1973-1995. The simulations were evaluated with ANUSPLIN, a daily observational gridded surface temperature and precipitation product and with meteorological data recorded at 28 stations within the upper Peace, Nechako, and upper Columbia River basins. In this work, we focus largely on a comparison of the skill of each model configuration in simulating the 90th percentile of daily precipitation (PR90). The companion paper describes the results for a wider range of temperature and precipitation extremes over the entire WCan domain.Over all three watersheds, both simulations exhibit cold biases compared with observations, with the bias exacerbated at higher resolution. Although both simulations generally display wet biases in median precipitation, CRCM15 features a reduced bias in PR90 in all three basins in summer and throughout the year in the upper Columbia River basin. However, the higher resolution model is inferior to CRCM45 with respect to rarer heavy precipitation events and also displays high spatial variability and lower spatial correlations with ANUSPLIN compared with the coarser resolution model. A reduction in the range of PR90 biases over the upper Columbia basin is noted when the 15km results are averaged to the 45km grid. This improvement is partly attributable to the averaging of errors between different elevation data used in the gridded observations and CRCM, but the sensitivity of CRCM15 to resolved topography is also clear from spatial maps of seasonal extremes. At the station scale, modest but systematic reductions in the bias of PR90 relative to ANUSPLIN are again found when the CRCM15 results are averaged to the 45km grid. Furthermore, the annual cycle of inter-station spatial variance in the upper Columbia River basin is well reproduced by CRCM15 but not by ANUSPLIN or CRCM45. The former result highlights the beneficial effect of spatial averaging of small-scale climate variability, whereas the latter is evidently a demonstration of the added value at high resolution vis-a-vis the improved simulation of precipitation at the resolution limit of the model. RESUME[Traduit par la redaction] Nous evaluons la capacite d'un modele regional de climat a simuler les statistiques d'evenements extremes. Nous examinons aussi l'effet de diverses resolutions horizontales, a l'echelle de basins hydrologiques individuels, en Colombie-Britannique, une province du Canada a la topographie complexe. Deux simulations du climat pour l'ouest du Canada ont ete menees avec le Modele regional canadien du climat (version 4), a une resolution horizontale de 15km (MRCC15) et de 45km (MRCC45). Les conditions limites provenaient de reanalyses mondiales s'etendant de 1973 a 1995. Les simulations ont ete evaluees a l'aide d'ANUSPLIN, un produit representant sur une grille les observations quotidiennes de temperature en surface et de precipitations, et avec des donnees meteorologiques mesurees a 28 stations situees dans les bassins versants de la partie superieure de la riviere de la Paix, de la Nechako et du haut Columbia. Dans cette etude, nous nous attardons surtout a comparer la capacite de chaque configuration du modele a simuler le 90(e) centile des precipitations quotidiennes (PR90). L'etude connexe presente les resultats pour un large eventail d'extremes de temperatures et de precipitations sur le domaine entier de l'ouest du Canada.Pour les trois bassins, les deux simulations presentent un biais froid par rapport aux observations. Ce biais est exacerbe a haute resolution. Bien que les deux simulations montrent un biais humide relativement aux precipitations medianes, le MRCC15 possede un biais reduit pour le PR90, et ce, dans les trois bassins en ete, et tout au long de l'annee dans le bassin du haut Columbia. Toutefois, le modele a haute resolution reste inferieur au MRCC45 en ce qui concerne les cas rares de fortes precipitations. Il montre aussi une grande variabilite spatiale et de moindres correlations spatiales avec ANUSPLIN, en comparaison avec le modele de resolution inferieure. Une reduction de l'ecart des biais du PR90 pour le bassin du haut Columbia ressort quand les resultats de modele a 15km sont lisses sur la grille de 45km. Cette amelioration s'avere en partie attribuable au lissage des erreurs relativement aux diverses donnees d'elevation utilisees pour les observations reparties sur la grille et dans le MRCC, mais la capacite du MRCC15 a resoudre la topographie est aussi evidente sur les cartes spatiales des extremes saisonniers. l'echelle de la station, des reductions modestes mais systematiques du biais du PR90 relativement a ANUSPLIN ressortent quand les resultats du MRCC15 sont lisses sur la grille de 45km. De plus, le MRCC15 reproduit bien le cycle annuel des variances spatiales entre les stations du bassin du haut Columbia, mais ni ANUSPLIN ni le MRCC45 n'y parviennent. De ces deux resultats, le premier revele l'effet benefique du lissage spatial des variabilites climatiques de petite echelle. Le second demontre nettement la valeur ajoutee de la haute resolution en raison de la simulation amelioree des precipitations a la limite de la resolution du modele.",10.1080/07055900.2016.1215287,2016,2016,[],False,,

One approach being evaluated involves a simple two date multispectral unsupervised classification approach to map forest change at a national scale with Landsat data. Key factors are the types and consistency of change classes that emerge from the clustering algorithms and issues related to labelling these into desired change classes. The technique was investigated using two sites. Prince George in central British Columbia, Canada used 1990 and 1999 imagery. The second site of Petawawa in eastern Ontario, has fifteen images from a time period from 1984 to 2001 that were normalized and then analyzed in various image pairs. Utilizing the six visible and infrared Landsat bands from each of two dates in a K-means hyperclustering, classes of conifer, hardwood and mixedwood that had not changed were separated. Before any amalgamation, many clusters were associated with change, especially changes in vegetation on old cuts and open fields. Post-clearing ground vegetation density and type had a moderate influence on the clustering process. Pre-clearing forest type was only a factor in general terms, for example whether it was hardwood, softwood or mixedwood. Clearcuts often had several clusters associated with them, but were well detected when clusters were amalgamated. Partial cuts were only partly detected. The length of time after the cut was an important consideration in their detection. They were detectable for only 2 or 3 years after the cutting.

Aboriginal women entrenched in poverty face further gender-specific harms which place them at increased risk for HIV infection. Methods: This study was cross-sectional and based on a community-based sample of Aboriginal young people (Metis, Aboriginal, First Nations, Inuit, and non-status Indians) between the ages of 14 and 30 years who used injection or non-injection non-cannabis illegal drugs (street drugs) in the previous month. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 543 participants living in either Vancouver or Prince George, Canada, were recruited by word of mouth, posters, and street outreach. Young people in the study completed a questionnaire administered by Aboriginal interviewers. Female participants (n = 262) were compared to male participants (n = 281) with respect to sociodemographics, trauma, sexual risk variables, and drug use patterns. Trained nurses drew blood samples for HIV and HCV antibodies and provided pre- and Post-test counseling. Results: Proportions positive for HIV and HCV were significantly higher among young women. HIV was 13.1% [9.5, 1.7.7] in women compared to 4.3% [2.5, 7.4] in men, and HCV was 43.6% [37.6, 49.8] in women as compared to 25.4% [20.5, 30.9] in men. When the analysis was restricted to young people who reported injection drug use, the proportions positive for HIV and HCV remained significantly higher among young women. Experiences of forced sex were reported by 70% of young women compared to 29% of young men, p < 0.001, while the median age of first forced sex was 6-years-old for both men and women. Discussion: The results of the final model indicated that HIV had been associated with residing in Vancouver, having injected for longer, and sexual abuse, but not being female. However, this gendered analysis demonstrated that a greater proportion of young women were experiencing sexual abuse, and sexual abuse was associated with HIV positive status. Harm reduction and drug treatment programs are urgently required that target women at a young age and address complex traumatic experiences associated with childhood sexual abuse.",10.1080/03630240802463186,2008,2008,[],False,,

The goal of the analysis is to assess whether insights from this branch of mathematical graph theory can be meaningfully applied to hydrometric data, and, more specifically, whether it may help guide decisions concerning stream gauge placement so that the full complexity of the regional hydrology is efficiently captured. The streamflow data, when represented as a complex network, have a global clustering coefficient and average shortest path length consistent with small-world networks, which are a class of stable and efficient networks common in nature, but the observed degree distribution did not clearly indicate a scale-free network. Stability helps ensure that the network is robust to the loss of nodes; in the context of a streamflow network, stability is interpreted as insensitivity to station removal at random. Community structure is also evident in the streamflow network. A network theoretic community detection algorithm identified separate communities, each of which appears to be defined by the combination of its median seasonal flow regime (pluvial, nival, hybrid, or glacial, which in this region in turn mainly reflects basin elevation) and geographic proximity to other communities (reflecting shared or different daily meteorological forcing). Furthermore, betweenness analyses suggest a handful of key stations which serve as bridges between communities and might be highly valued. We propose that an idealized sampling network should sample high-betweenness stations, small-membership communities which are by definition rare or undersampled relative to other communities, and index stations having large numbers of intracommunity links, while retaining some degree of redundancy to maintain network robustness.",10.5194/hess-19-3301-2015,2015,2015,[],False,,

The benefit to the original owner of the water rights, the Province of British Columbia, was economic and population growth. The purpose of this paper is to follow the contestation over these rights from 1948 to 2016. Design/methodology/approach An institutional logics perspective was taken to analyze the main actors and how their relative power (dominant versus fringe) changed in the institutional field. Archival data and selected interviews were mapped to institutional logics across three time periods. Findings In the inter-temporal setting, many of the actors that were fringe in 1950 became more dominant by 2016. For example, the local indigenous peoples, the Cheslatta Carrier First Nation, were flooded off their land to make way for Alcan's dam. They ended up as very powerful players in the institutional field. The perpetual rights given to Alcan made it a dominant actor across all time periods, despite changes in the logics of the institutional field. Research limitations/implications A single case was studied; other comparative settings should be explored to contrast and compare. The data were primarily archival, supplemented by only three interviews of those related to the case study. This case study is also one where water rights were privatized in perpetuity, which may not be the case in other settings. Practical implications Current governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should use this case to understand the long-term effects of resource policy decisions. Social implications The building of large dams has been, and continues to be, used worldwide to provide power to create economic growth. Our setting provides insight into the long-term societal outcomes of using water rights in this way.

Eighteen paper birch populations (49-558 degrees N) were collected from five distinct geographic regions in BC to determine whether observed variability in spring bud phenology was due to genetics, the growing environment or their interaction. Seedlings were grown at three common gardens in Prince George (53 degrees 45'N), Salmon Arm (50 degrees 47'N) and Victoria (48 degrees 29'N) to observe the bud break. Further a controlled photoperiod, a root zone temperature and a translocation experiment from the northern to central garden were conducted to investigate the effect of photoperiod and root temperature on birch bud break. Results revealed that timing of spring bud phenology in paper birch is under genetic and environmental control, following climatic clines based on latitude from south to north. Bud flush at the southern common garden was on an average 25 days earlier and required 177 more growing degree day than the northern common garden. Conversely, our controlled experiments and seed source translocation experiment showed that the signal for the onset of spring bud flush is controlled by air temperature, soil temperature, and photoperiod.

Understanding how reforestation materials are spatially and temporally deployed across the landscape is an integral component of forest genetic resources management. To improve the current understanding of how reforestation materials are deployed in British Columbia (BC), we developed a geographical information systems (GIS) method to track seed deployment across silviculture openings. Generally, reforestation materials can originate from either natural stand (wild seed collections) or orchards' seed sources (improved seed); the latter are produced within the framework of specific tree improvement program designed for a particular species within a well-defined seed deployment area, commonly known as Seed Planning Zone (SPZ). In this paper, we present a GIS-based method for evaluating seed deployment patterns for interior spruce (Picea glauca and Picea engelmannii and their natural hybrids) within the Prince George SPZ. The evaluation period (1970-2004) is associated with wild stands and improved seed availability and the dynamic of each seed source proportionate contribution followed three distinct phases; namely, developing (1970-1987), immature (1988-1994), and mature (1995-2004) with a progressive increase of orchards' seed use over time. The developed method is scalable across SPZs of the same species or multiple species, thus providing the means to: 1) temporally and spatially monitor improved and natural stands seed deployment over the landscape; and 2) identify areas of concerns where a particular seed source is over-represented which might pose an increased genetic vulnerability. The present study revealed that the current interior spruce orchard's seed use within the Prince George SPZ is expected to exceed the provincial goal of performance target of 75% by 2014.

The intent was to highlight the difference between the dendroclimatic outcomes of standard ring-width analyses to those derived from density chronologies collected at high elevation locations in the British Columbia Coast Mountains.

Since the inception of the program, this threshold has been exceeded only rarely; however, the variables that influence water temperature and that are used to manage water releases in the Nechako River watershed have not been subject to an independent analysis. Increasing demand for water at other times of year and a desire to restore a more natural hydrograph to the river to meet other ecological demands have impelled this analysis. A principal components analysis that examined the factors contributing to river temperature demonstrated that the summer controlled flow releases accounted for 24% of the temperature variability and were probably a factor in maintaining compliance with the program's temperature threshold. Furthermore, during most summers, the Nechako River provided a cooling influence to input from the Stuart River tributary in a downstream reach that is used by the majority of the migrating sockeye salmon.

The Enbridge Corporation has applied to construct a pipeline system to deliver diluted bitumen from the Alberta tar sands to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, but the Carrier Sekani Tribal Council and their member communities have asserted the authority to prevent this project from passing through their unceded territories. Studying Carrier Sekani contestation of Canadian regulatory assessment of the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project, we examine how the processes of Indigenous becoming exceed notions of Indigenous being that are included in the permitting process as traditional knowledge. We focus both on the performance of legal obligations to consider Aboriginal traditional knowledge and the emerging politics of Carrier Sekani resistance. Our intention is not to question the integrity of traditional knowledge that the regulatory process incorporates, but to highlight how traditional knowledge functions as an anchor for a field of governmental inquiry and action. Providing a historical and geographical context of Carrier Sekani relations with development and the state, we argue that the coding of Indigenous being as traditional works to disavow contemporary processes of Indigenous becoming that are surplus to the spatial ontology of capitalist energy development for global markets. Against efforts to sanction development on disputed territory through formal recognition of a constrained Indigeneity, Carrier Sekani people assert the sovereign authority to prevent or permit development on their lands and waterways using traditional governance systems. Broadly, this paper suggests that recognizing the ontological politics at stake in this permitting process provides a useful opening to understand continued colonial captures at work in the inclusion of traditional knowledge in environmental governance. But it also demonstrates the capacity of Indigenous resistance to these enclosures to challenge and reshape global geographies of energy, capitalism, and climate.",10.1177/1474474013482807,2014,2014-01-01,[],False,,

Opening up new markets for Canada’s oil sands, shale and off-shore gas resources will require an expansion of the pipeline system in northern British Columbia, Alberta and the Northwest Territories. While navigating the regulatory approval process can be a formidable hurdle, a far greater challenge is how proponents manage the process of building relationships and consulting with affected Aboriginal communities. Failing to earn Aboriginal support for proposed projects can be a “show-stopper”.Exploration of new basins in Canada, driven by increased demand for energy in Asia, may compete with other land uses and constitutionally-protected rights and practices of indigenous peoples. Public, media and environmental response to new pipelines is often lead by the reaction of impacted communities. The task of identifying the social risks to a project, understanding the engagement process, fulfilling the regulatory consultation requirements of different jurisdictions, balancing impacts with benefits, managing issues and resolving disputes, communicating with the public and media effectively all require improved skills and approaches.The paper surveys the stakeholder engagement experience and differences in approaches for recently proposed major arctic gas and western oil pipeline projects, as well as pipelines to service Liquefied Natural Gas export facilities on the Pacific north coast, providing practical insights with possibly international application.

Legitimacy during the establishment of a collaboration depends principally on community readiness to collaborate, a sense of need, and the perceived potential for goal achievement. As a collaboration continues to grow, its legitimacy forms mainly from normative processes—the perceived quality of factors such as accountability, transparency, consensus-building, and representation of relevant discourses. Once a collaboration reaches maturity and faces questions of its future existence, legitimacy is largely result-based—tangible and contextually meaningful outcomes must be easily identifiable and promoted.

Water loss through evapotranspiration reduces volumes available for run-off. The transition from liquid to water vapour on open water surfaces requires heat. Consequently, evaporation act as a cooling mechanism during summer. Both river discharge and water temperature simulations are thus influenced by the methods used to model evaporation. In this paper, the impact of evapotranspiration estimation methods on simulated discharge is assessed using a semidistributed model on two Canadian watersheds. The impact of evaporation estimation methods on water temperature simulations is also evaluated. Finally, the validity of using the same formulation to simulate both of these processes is verified. Five well-known evapotranspiration models and five evaporation models with different wind functions were tested. Results show a large disparity (18–22% of mean annual total evapotranspiration) among the evapotranspiration methods, leading to important differences in simulated discharge (3–25% of observed discharge). Larger differences result from evaporation estimation methods with mean annual divergences of 34–48%. This translates into a difference in mean summer water temperature of 1–15%. Results also show that the choice of model parameter has less influence than the choice of evapotranspiration method in discharge simulations. However, the parameter values influence thermal simulations in the same order of magnitude as the choice of evaporation estimation method. Overall, the results of this study suggest that evapotranspiration and open water evaporation should be represented separately in a hydrological modelling framework, especially when water temperature simulations are required.",10.1002/hyp.13534,2019,2019,[],False,,

G.']",161-176,30,1,"0366-483x, 1432-0819","ConclusionsThe widespread, explosive eruption of acid volcanic rocks in the early Tertiary represents a unique event in the Phanerozoic history of the Canadian Cordilleran orogen. It coincides with a period of general uplift during which the central part of the former eugeosyncline was subjected to tensional stresses resulting in rifting and block faulting accompanied by submissive intrusion of epizonal, acid plutons. Both the plutons and the acid volcanic rocks are considered to be products of the same magma. Periodic escape of gas from the tops of large magma chambers was accompanied by intense shattering of the roof rocks and expulsion of great volumes of gas-charged magma which produced the thick piles of welded tuff and ignimbrite that characterize the early Tertiary Sloko succession.The area underlain by the early Tertiary acid volcanic rocks coincides with that of the Whitehorse-Nechako Trough, a belt of prolonged subsidence in which the greatest thickness of eugeosynclinal sedimentary and volcanic rocks accumulated through most of Mesozoic time. This fact, plus the predominance of acidic rather than basic lavas and plutons in the early Tertiary of British Columbia, suggests that these rocks originated from primary anatectic magma rather than acid magma derived through differentiation of a more basic parent.",10.1007/BF02597666,1967,1967-12-01,[],False,,

Assessments were possible for 5,487 (57%) of all stocks and included all large, commercially important stocks. The assessments found 624 stocks were at high risk, 78 were at moderate risk, 230 were of special concern, and 142 were extirpated in this century. We were unable to classify 4,172 (43%) of the stocks because of an absence of reliable data. Due to their small size, these stocks are not of great commercial importance, although they are important to the maintenance of salmonid diversity. We also identified many potential threats to anadromous salmon stocks. The absence of systematic, high-quality assessments at the biological stock level precluded reliable assignment of the specific causes for many of the stocks apparently at risk. Nevertheless, habitat degradation associated with logging, urbanization, and hydropower development contributed to most of the 142 documented stock extinctions. Furthermore, there is little doubt that overutilization by commercial and recreational fisheries has in many cases resulted in severe stock depressions that, when added to other factors, has put many stocks at risk.",10.1577/1548-8446(1996)021<0020:SOASAT>2.0.CO;2,1996,1996-10-01,[],False,,

Tourism is British Columbia's third largest industry, yet tourist facilities, especially publicly provided facilities, have been experiencing crowding problems, which many believe result in deterioration in the quality of the recreational experience. In July, 1973, British Columbia's Minister of Highways responded to this situation by advocating a ban on all United States' recreational vehicles.In the present paper the problems of recreational resource development are subjected to economic analysis. One group of non-Canadian users, namely, sport fishermen, is singled out for attention. The consequences of various relevant recreation policies are discussed on a regional basis, drawing on a selection of studies undertaken by the Northern Economics Unit, Federal Fisheries Service, in Vancouver.The conclusions of the paper are as follows. It is evident that public attitudes towards non-resident use of locally identified recreational resources vary significantly from one region to another.Overcrowded conditions prevailing in some areas are not evident in others and policies must be flexible enough to take account of regional variation. Furthermore, excess demand is often a reflection of inconsistent government policies which produce a gap between the planned utilisation and the planned provision of facilities. Under such conditions discrimination on the basis of residential status is likely to be carried to lengths beyond those justified by economic analysis. In particular, in the case of British Columbia, to focus attention on restricting non-Canadian use is to divert attention away from the real problem. In the final analysis, if governments are concerned with providing an optimal amount of good quality recreational opportunities and maximising the real net benefits accruing to residents under their jurisdictions, then a policy package more finely attuned to these objectives is necessary.",10.1007/BF01295823,1974,1974-06-01,[],False,,

Mining development could create new jobs through economic development, reducing the exodus of skilled workers and nurturing the already fragile state of many rural communities, including First Nations. Recent issues over new BC mining projects and their impacts on surrounding communities prompt consideration of an approach to project planning that goes beyond simply aiming to mitigate environmental and social impacts. The opportunity exists to involve the participation of communities early in the planning process and to place greater consideration on the contribution of a project to building social capital in these mining communities. There is also the possibility to consider the role of a particular project in a more strategic sense, as part of regional development planning that deals with wider issues, time spans and synergies relating to socio-economic development in mining communities. This article stems from early research into the characterisa- tion of social capital and the use of community-indicators to forecast specific social and economic outcomes for new mining projects.

By employing cartographic imagery, generational juxtaposition, and a first-person dual point of view that negotiates between spectral and spiritless worlds, Monkey Beach contextualizes habitual drinking as a response to alienation from cultural practices that are becoming increasingly threatened by ongoing colonial and capitalist policies of individualism and acculturation. The Haisla characters contend with the affective consequences of living in what Karl Marx calls a “coerced” and “forced labor” economy. Yet, because the forced transition to this mode of production is a relatively recent process within Indigenous histories — one that is violently and insidiously imposed, rather than always already installed — it has not become fully naturalized. Consequently, Robinson depicts addiction as engendered not only by historical trauma emergent from the dismantling of Indigenous lifeways connecting kinship, land, and spirituality, but also by the ideological and material conditions of capital. Ultimately, Robinson's novel betrays how the material conditions of late capitalism exacerbate colonial trauma, which manifests as social suffering, and extend colonialism’s acculturative shadow.

However, the Skeena Fold Belt, which spans most of the width of the northern Intermontane Belt, exhibits shortening comparable with that in the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt. The Skeena Fold Belt has many features of thin-skinned fold and thrust belts, such as thrust faults which sole into a detachment, a wide variety of structural styles which depend on rock type, a foreland basin which was cannibalized by continued deformation, a frontal triangle zone, and a hinterland of metamorphic and plutonic rocks (Coast Plutonic Complex). The Skeena Fold Belt thus is comparable with the Rocky Mountain Fold and Thrust Belt, but rather than deforming a continental terrace wedge, it developed in a terrane (Stikinia) which had accreted to North America in the early Mesozoic, and in Jurassic and Cretaceous clastic successions (Bowser Lake and Sustut groups) which overlie Stikinia. Structural and stratigraphic relationships show that the earliest deformation occurred between Oxfordian and Albian time and that the last folds developed in latest Cretaceous or early Tertiary time.

P.']",359-388,88,1,1095-8649,"Over the past several decades, a substantial amount of research has examined how cardiorespiratory physiology supports the diverse activities performed throughout the life cycle of Pacific salmon, genus Oncorhynchus. Pioneering experiments emphasized the importance of aerobic scope in setting the functional thermal tolerance for activity in fishes. Variation in routine metabolism can have important performance and fitness consequences as it is related to dominance, aggression, boldness, territoriality, growth rate, postprandial oxygen consumption, life history, season, time of day, availability of shelter and social interactions. Wild fishes must perform many activities simultaneously (e.g. swim, obtain prey, avoid predators, compete, digest and reproduce) and oxygen delivery is allocated among competing organ systems according to the capacity of the heart to deliver blood. For example, salmonids that are simultaneously swimming and digesting trade-off maximum swimming performance in order to support the oxygen demands of digestion. As adult Pacific salmonids cease feeding in the ocean prior to their home migration, endogenous energy reserves and cardiac capacity are primarily partitioned among the demands for swimming upriver, sexual maturation and spawning behaviours. Furthermore, the upriver spawning migration is under strong selection pressure, given that Pacific salmonids are semelparous (single opportunity to spawn). Consequently, these fishes optimize energy expenditures in a number of ways: strong homing, precise migration timing, choosing forward-assist current paths and exploiting the boundary layer to avoid the strong currents in the middle of the river, using energetically efficient swimming speeds, and recovering rapidly from anaerobic swimming. Upon arrival at the spawning ground, remaining energy can be strategically allocated to the various spawning behaviours. Strong fidelity to natal streams has resulted in reproductively isolated populations that appear to be locally adapted physiologically to their specific environmental conditions. Populations with more challenging migrations have enhanced cardiorespiratory performance. Pacific salmonids are able to maintain aerobic scope across the broad range of temperatures encountered historically during their migration; however, climate change-induced river warming has created lethal conditions for many populations, raising conservation concerns. Despite considerable research examining cardiorespiratory physiology in Pacific salmonids over the last 70 years, critical knowledge gaps are identified.",10.1111/jfb.12790,2016,2016-01-01,[],False,,

However, managing watersheds for human health and well-being requires the ability to move beyond typical reductionist approaches toward more holistic methods. Health and well-being are emergent properties of inter-related social and biophysical processes. This paper characterizes points of connection and integration between watershed management and public health and tests a new conceptual model, the Watershed Governance Prism, to determine the prevalence in peer-reviewed literature of different perspectives relating to watersheds and public health. We conducted an initial search of academic databases for papers that addressed the interface between watershed management (or governance) and public health themes. We then generated a sample of these papers and undertook a collaborative analysis informed by the Watershed Governance Prism. Our analysis found that although these manuscripts dealt with a range of biophysical and social determinants of health, there was a tendency for social factors and health outcomes to be framed as context only for these studies, rather than form the core of the relationships being investigated. At least one cluster of papers emerged from this analysis that represented a cohesive perspective on watershed governance and health; “Perspective B” on the Watershed Governance Prism, “water governance for ecosystems and well-being,” was dominant. Overall, the integration of watershed management/governance and public health is in its infancy.",10.1007/s00267-014-0301-3,2014,2014-08-01,[],False,,

Data were used in an energy-balance model to calculate snow ablation in each stand and estimate effects on meltwater production. Results showed that the dead stand no longer behaved like an alive stand, but had not yet approached cleared stand conditions. Ablation rates in the dead stand remained similar to those in the alive stand, although accumulation was closer to that in the cleared stand. The combination of a low ablation rate and increased ground snow accumulation in the dead stand resulted in a lengthened period of snowpack disappearance. In the cleared stand, however, high ablation rates were sufficient to remove the thicker snowpack earlier than in the dead stand.

Hydroclimate projections in such basins often ﬁnd reductions in annual peak runoff due to decreased snowpack under global warming. British Columbia's Fraser River Basin (FRB) is a large, nival basin with exposure to moisture‐laden atmospheric rivers originating in the Paciﬁc Ocean. Landfalling atmospheric rivers over the region in winter are projected to increase in both strength and frequency in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 climate models. We investigate future changes in hydrology and annual peak daily streamﬂow in the FRB using a hydrologic model driven by a bias‐corrected Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 ensemble. Under Representative Concentration Pathway (8.5), the FRB evolves toward a nival‐pluvial regime featuring an increasing association of extreme rainfall with annual peak daily ﬂow, a doubling in cold season peak discharge, and a decrease in the return period of the largest historical ﬂow, from a 1‐in‐200‐year to 1‐in‐50‐year event by the late 21st century. Plain Language Summary: Snow‐covered areas of the globe are particularly sensitive to global warming. Future projections using global climate models generally show that as the ratio of snow to rain declines, river ﬂows peak earlier in the year with reduced volume. These models also capture the phenomenon of “atmospheric rivers”: long, meandering plumes of water vapor often originating over the tropical oceans that bring sustained, heavy precipitation to the west coasts of North America and northern Europe. The present‐day frequency of landfalling atmospheric rivers on the Canadian west coast is projected to increase nearly fourfold by the late 21st century, with a proportionate increase in extreme rainfall events. Our work is the ﬁrst to directly investigate the impact of these “rivers in the sky” on “rivers on the land” using climate model projections. Focusing on the Fraser River Basin, Canada's largest Paciﬁc watershed, and using a business‐as‐usual industrial emissions scenario, we show that the basin transitions from one where peak ﬂow results from spring snowmelt to one where peak ﬂow is often caused by extreme rainfall. Our modeling suggests that extreme rainfall events resulting from atmospheric rivers may lead to peak annual ﬂoods of historic proportions, and of unprecedented frequency, by the late 21st century in the Fraser River Basin.",10.1029/2018GL080720,2019,2019,[],False,,

The Fraser River is the largest Canadian waterway flowing to the Pacific Ocean and is one of the world’s greatest salmon rivers. Our analyses reveal high runoff rates and low interannual variability in alpine and coastal rivers, and low runoff rates and high interannual variability in most streams in BC’s interior. The interannual variability in streamflow is also low in rivers such as the Adams, Chilko, Quesnel and Stuart where the principal salmon runs of the Fraser River occur. A trend analysis shows a spatially coherent signal with increasing interannual variability in streamflow across the FRB in recent decades, most notably in spring and summer. The upward trend in the coefficient of variation in annual runoff coincides with a period of near-normal annual runoff for the Fraser River at Hope. The interannual variability in streamflow is greater in regulated rather than natural systems; however, it is unclear whether it is predominantly flow regulation that leads to these observed differences. Environmental changes such as rising air temperatures, more frequent polarity changes in large-scale climate teleconnections such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation, and retreating glaciers may be contributing to the greater range in annual runoff fluctuations across the FRB. This has implications for ecological processes throughout the basin, for example affecting migrating and spawning salmon, a keystone species vital to First Nations communities as well as to commercial and recreational fisheries. To exemplify this linkage between variable flows and biological responses, the unusual FRB runoff anomalies observed in 2010 are discussed in the context of that year’s sockeye salmon run. As the climate continues to warm, greater variability in annual streamflow, and hence in hydrological extremes, may influence ecological processes and human usage throughout the FRB in the 21st century.",,2012,2012,[],False,,

Included in winter diets are various species of conifers, some of which are important forestry and ornamental crop trees. Diet choices and feeding habits of mule deer utilizing conifer crops, however, have not been widely reported. Here, we document diet choices made by human-habituated mule deer from north central British Columbia during an exploratory cafeteria-style feeding trial using boughs of thirteen species of native North American and introduced European conifers. Mule deer consumed more biomass from exotic conifers (specifically pine) than from rarely encountered native conifers, and consumed the least biomass from those native conifers commonly encountered by deer in northern BC, a finding which appears to lend support to the Biotic Resistance Hypothesis. From most to least biomass consumed, deer selected Mugho pine, Scots pine, western hemlock, subalpine fir, Douglas fir, Norway spruce, Ponderosa pine, western white pine, lodgepole pine, common juniper, red cedar, black spruce, and hybrid white spruce. Analysis of Variance testing suggested that deer preferred to eat exotic Mugho and Scots pine and avoided eating commonly encountered, native black and hybrid white spruce. A relationship also existed between the biomass consumed and the number of bites taken by deer from each species, which generally indicated that deer took more bites from exotic and rarely encountered conifers, but not always. Our results suggest that northern mule deer, therefore, may be more likely to damage introduced pine and other exotics relative to native species planted in either ornamental or forest plantation settings when deer densities are high and/or browse resources are limited.",10.3955/046.091.0110,2017,2017-01-01,[],False,,

Although the growth of juvenile Chinook Salmon has been well studied, research has focused on a single population, a narrow range of fish sizes, or a narrow range of temperatures. Therefore, we incorporated the Ratkowsky model for temperature-dependent growth into an allometric growth model; this model was then fitted to growth data from 11 data sources representing nine populations of juvenile Chinook Salmon. The model fit the growth data well, explaining 98% of the variation in final mass. The estimated allometric mass exponent (b) was 0.338 (SE = 0.025), similar to estimates reported for other salmonids. This estimate of b will be particularly useful for estimating mass-standardized growth rates of juvenile Chinook Salmon. In addition, the lower thermal limit, optimal temperature, and upper thermal limit for growth were estimated to be 1.8°C (SE = 0.63°C), 19.0°C (SE = 0.27°C), and 24.9°C (SE = 0.02°C), respectively.

Well into the twentieth century, Aboriginal peoples in Canada were discursively constructed by colonists as child-like subjects in need of colonial intervention in order that they ‘grow up’ into de-Indigenized Canadian citizens. Further, an important aspect of the colonial project entailed confining Aboriginal children in institutions known as Indian Residential Schools wherein, through material and curricular means, efforts were made to transform the children and dispossess them of socio-cultural identities. Much of the literature on children's geographies contemplates the socially constructed nature of childhood and critiques the pervasive (yet under-evaluated) understanding that childhood is a clear and demarcatable state of being prior to adulthood. Little attention, though, has been paid to historic or social discourses that relegated groups of people to a perpetual state of truncated childhood while simultaneously removing their children in order that those children mature into adults who embodied radically different cultural traits than their ancestors.

Kevin', 'Foote, Chris J.', 'Wood, Chris C.']",287-305,84,2,1095-8312,"Understanding the mechanisms that decrease gene flow between diverging populations is critical to understanding speciation. Anadromous (sockeye) and nonanadromous (kokanee) morphs of the Pacific sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka spawn sympatrically and interbreed, yet allele frequency differences at neutral loci indicate restricted gene flow. Disruptive natural selection associated with strong selective differences between anadromous and nonanadromous life histories is thought to maintain the genetic differentiation of the morphs. Recently, a putative third morph of O. nerka exhibiting green rather than red breeding colour has been found on the spawning grounds sympatric with sockeye and kokanee. We investigated the ancestry of these green fish in a 2-year controlled breeding study by using previously documented heritable, countergradient variation in red breeding colour to distinguish pure and hybrid morphs. Stabilizing sexual selection for similar red breeding colour in sockeye and kokanee has led to adaptive differences in the efficiency of carotenoid uptake between the morphs given differences in carotenoid availability between marine and lacustrine habitats. On the same diet, offspring parented by the green fish were intermediate in colour and in the concentration of dietary carotenoid pigments in their flesh and skin to those parented by either sockeye or kokanee; they were most similar to those parented by known kokanee × sockeye hybrids. This countergradient variation in carotenoid use results in a genotype-environment mismatch in nonanadromous hybrids that exposes them by their breeding colour on the spawning grounds. Given that red colour is important in mate choice, sexual selection will almost certainly reduce reproductive opportunities for these hybrids and promote sympatric divergence of these incipient species. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2005, 84, 287–305.",10.1111/j.1095-8312.2005.00430.x,2005,2005-02-01,[],False,,

At each visit, participants completed a detailed questionnaire administered by an Aboriginal interviewer. For this analysis, we included information for 512 participants who were recruited between September 2003 and April 2005. Results Among the 512 participants, the prevalence of HCV infection was 34.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 30.6%–38.9%); the rates were similar in Prince George and Vancouver (34.5% and 35.0% respectively, p = 0.37).

An introductory summary of impacts on temperature, precipitation and streamflow was prepared by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (PCIC) and presented at several workshops. From the workshops the implications of these changes were identified with feedback from senior city staff and planners and documented in a report, Climate Change in Prince George: Summary of Past Trends and Future Projections and will form the basis of the report Adapting to Climate Change in Prince George. Prince George is a city of roughly 77,000 inhabitants, built on a flood plain at the confluence of the Nechako and Upper Fraser rivers. During the winter of 2007-2008, Prince George experienced severe ice-related flooding when lands along the lower Nechako River were inundated causing extensive damage. The watersheds surrounding Prince George encompass the headwaters of the largest river in BC (the Fraser) and have been heavily impacted by mountain pine beetle. These factors make this region susceptible to climate change impacts, and maintaining water security in this region is a concern to both the residents of Prince George and the Province. Over the last century the city experienced an average warming trend of 1.3°C. In recent decades, Prince George has become warmer in the winter season and a greater percentage of precipitation has fallen as rain rather than snow. Future climate projections were used with an evaluation of uncertainty to allow planners, managers and engineers to better integrate this information and make informed decisions as they prepare to adapt. Annual temperatures in the region are projected to increase by an average of 1.6°C to 2.5°C over the next 50 years. Precipitation during this time is projected to increase by 3% to 10%, with increases occurring primarily in winter and decreases possibly occurring in summer. These precipitation and temperature changes will result in changes to streamflow timing and amount that depend on watershed location and type. PCIC partnered with a local resident and expert in adaptation to synthesize these findings and place them in the context of vulnerabilities particular to their community. PCIC has undertaken several similar assessments and has established that an integral part of the procedure is identifying a local champion who leads the effort of defining community needs and ensuring that the report addresses these issues. The champion facilitates a two-way knowledge transfer that is the first step in the complex and difficult process of engaging stakeholders with diverse needs and conflicting demands for limited water resources. Many organizations and user groups such as Rio Tinto Alcan, who regulate flow on the Nechako River, have a stake in water resource management in this north-central region of the Province.",,2009,2009-12-01,[],False,,

Previous studies indicate that the hydrologic model may not be able to replicate some of the indicators of interest, which raises questions on the reliability of model simulated changes. Hence, we initiated a study to evaluate the replicability of the streamflow changes by employing the widely used variable infiltration capacity hydrologic model for sub-basins and mainstem of the Fraser River Basin, Canada. Given that the hydrologic regime of the region is known to be influenced by teleconnections to the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), we used hydrologic responses to the PDO and ENSO states as analogues for evaluating the model's ability to simulate climate-induced changes. The results revealed that the qualitative patterns of response, such as lower flows for the warm PDO state compared to the cool state, and progressively higher flows for the warm, neutral and cool ENSO states, were generally well reproduced for most hydrologic indicators. Additionally, while the directions of change between the different PDO and ENSO states were mostly well replicated, the magnitude of change for some of the indicators showed considerable differences. Hence, replicability of both magnitude and direction of change need to be carefully examined before using the simulated indicators for assessing future hydrologic changes, and a reliable replication increases the confidence of projected changes.

This large basin presents a unique modelling case due to its physiographic heterogeneity and the potentially large implications of changes to its hydrologic regime. The macro-scale Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model was employed to simulate 30-year baseline (1970s) and future (2050s) hydrologic regimes based on climate forcings derived from eight global climate models (GCMs) runs under three emissions scenarios (B1, A1B and A2). Bias Corrected Spatial Disaggregation was used to statistically downscale GCM outputs to the resolution of the VIC model (1/16°). The modelled future scenarios for the 11 sub-basins and three regions (eastern mountains, central plateau and coastal mountains) of the FRB exhibit spatially varied responses, such as, shifts from snow-dominant to hybrid regime in the eastern and coastal mountains and hybrid to rain-dominant regime in the central plateau region. The analysis of temporal changes illustrated considerable uncertainties in the projections obtained from an ensemble of GCMs and emission scenarios. However, direction of changes obtained from the GCM ensembles and emissions scenarios are consistent amongst one another. The most significant temporal changes could include earlier onsets of snowmelt-driven peak discharge, increased winter and spring runoff and decreased summer runoff. The projected winter runoff increases and summer decreases are more pronounced in the central plateau region. The results also revealed increases in the total annual discharge and decreases in the 30-year mean of the peak annual discharge. Such climate-induced changes could have implications for water resources management in the region. The spatially and temporally varied hydro-climatic projections and their range of projections can be used for local-scale adaptation in this important water resource system for British Columbia.

Mark', 'Heath, Daniel D.']",2571-2583,12,10,1365-294X,"Population viability has often been assessed by census of reproducing adults. Recently this method has been called into question and estimation of the effective population size (Ne) proposed as a complementary method to determine population health. We examined genetic diversity in five populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Fraser River watershed (British Columbia, Canada) at 11 microsatellite loci over 20 years using DNA extracted from archived scale samples. We tested for changes in genetic diversity, calculated the ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size to give the statistic M, calculated Ne from the temporal change in allele frequency, used the maximum likelihood method to calculate effective population size (NeM), calculated the harmonic mean of population size, and compared these statistics to annual census estimates. Over the last two decades population size has increased in all five populations of chinook examined; however, Ne calculated for each population was low (81–691) and decreasing over the time interval measured. Values of NeM were low, but substantially higher than Ne calculated using the temporal method. The calculated values for M were generally low (M < 0.70), indicating recent population reductions for all five populations. Large-scale historic barriers to migration and development activities do not appear to account for the low values of Ne; however, available spawning area is positively correlated with Ne. Both Ne and M estimates indicate that these populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding effects and may lack the ability to respond adaptively to stochastic events. Our findings question the practice of relying exclusively on census estimates for interpreting population health and show the importance of determining genetic diversity within populations.",10.1046/j.1365-294X.2003.01932.x,2003,2003-10-01,[],False,,

This study evaluates the hydrologic prediction skill of a dynamical climate model–driven hydrologic prediction system (CM-HPS), based on an ensemble of statistically downscaled outputs from the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS). For comparison, historical and future climate traces–driven ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP) was employed. The Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC) hydrologic model setup for the Fraser River basin, British Columbia, Canada, was used as a test bed for the two systems. In both cases, results revealed limited precipitation prediction skill. For streamflow prediction, the ESP approach has very limited or no correlation skill beyond the months influenced by initial hydrologic conditions, while the CM-HPS has moderately better correlation skill, attributable to the enhanced temperature prediction skill that results from CanSIPS’s ability to predict El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and its teleconnections. The root-mean-square error, bias, and categorical skills for the two methods are mostly similar. Hydrologic modeling uncertainty also affects the prediction skill, and in some cases prediction skill is constrained by hydrologic model skill. Overall, the CM-HPS shows potential for seasonal streamflow prediction, and further enhancements in climate models could potentially to lead to more skillful hydrologic predictions.",10.1175/JHM-D-14-0167.1,2015,2015-02-06,[],False,,

Predictions of the model were compared to the location and amount of habitat actually used by adult chinook salmon in 1974, 1980, and 1986. About 3800 m2 (70 per cent) of the spawning area actually used by the population were predicted as unusable by the ‘best’ prediction, while 87 per cent of the area predicted as usable has never had recorded use. The ‘best’ prediction resulted from using close transect spacing, frequent measurements along the transect, river-specific habitat suitability criteria, and modelling habitat at the fish's position near the stream bottom. Depending upon the spacing of the transects and the habitat suitability criteria used, PHABSIM predicted 210 per cent to 660 per cent more spawning habitat was available than historically had ever been used. Chinook salmon in the Nechako River spawn mainly on the upstream face of dunes, therefore, the assumption in PHABSIM that conditions predicted at the transects remain unchanged upstream and downstream part way to the adjacent transects was false. This assumption resulted in about two-thirds of the correct predictions being made for the wrong reason. The accuracy of PHABSIM's predictions for spawning might be improved by incorporating an index of river bottom topography or velocity gradient into the model.",10.1002/rrr.3450030127,1989,1989-01-01,[],False,,

Previous studies of lake sediment deposits in western Canada attributed increased sedimentation to land use; however, high catchment variability and short- and long-term climatic responses complicated the interpretation of those regional records. We compiled a large inventory of lake catchment data transecting the Canadian cordillera that comprised 210Pb-based profiles of deposition, GIS-based land use records, and interpolated climate change data. We used these data and mixed-effects modeling to relate sedimentation trends to land use and climate change since the mid-20th century. Although sedimentation was highly variable, increasing trends in accumulation corresponded with cumulative land use and, to a lesser degree, with climate change. Road density was the most important variable, but the inclusion of timber harvesting density further improved model fits significantly. Land use effects were more difficult to discern for the easternmost region of the Alberta Plateau where sedimentation appeared to be cumulatively associated with both timber and energy resource extraction. Stronger relations were obtained with whole catchment (0.50–273 km2) measures of land use, suggesting that fine sediment is efficiently transferred from hillslopes to the lake basins. While accounting for land use, a climate signal was also detected with improved model fits obtained with the inclusion of catchment warming. Further modeling results suggest that at least one critical control of reconstructed sedimentation remains undetermined. Interdecadal rates of lake sedimentation in western Canada have steadily increased during the late 20th century, following patterns of regional environmental change.",10.1016/j.ancene.2014.02.006,2013,2013-11,[],False,,

Conversely, moose populations expanded during the 1900s and rapidly colonized forested areas formerly occupied by caribou. Although the general trend in range recession and expansion is documented, the processes, timing, and spatial extent of overlap between these two ungulates are uncertain. Such details have implications for our understanding of the ecology of these species and the conservation of woodland caribou. Using historical-ecological methods, we documented the distribution and abundance of caribou and moose over a 150-year period. Also, we evaluated three general sources of evidence for documenting long-term changes in the distribution of hunted or trapped fauna: (1) semi-structured interviews with Aboriginal and non-aboriginal residents; (2) journals of the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC); and (3) primary written sources. The findings of this study suggested that caribou were relatively wide-spread throughout the study area until the late 1800s when their distribution began to decline. The first recorded sighting of moose in the study area was 1832, although consensus among sources suggested that moose expanded into the area at the end of the 1800s becoming abundant in the 1920s and 1930s. Proposed causes of decline of caribou included climatic change during the 1800s and habitat loss, hunting, and altered predator-prey dynamics through the early 1900s. Our analysis of three sources of historical information and knowledge confirmed the value of Local and Traditional Ecological Knowledge in documenting and explaining long-term historical distribution of hunted species. Alternatively, HBC journals and other written sources provided good temporal specificity, but few recorded locations of caribou or moose.

Methods: The study surveyed (June until August 2020) 187 orthopaedic surgeons in British Columbia affiliated with the University of British Columbia or the British Columbia Orthopaedic Association using an online survey to help identify the impact of COVID-19 on patient care, work and personal life. Results: Eighty-seven out of 187 (46.5%) orthopaedic surgeons participated in the online survey. All types of surgeries were completely cancelled for 23 respondents. Elective surgeries were cancelled for most respondents (in-hospital n = 38 and/or ambulatory n = 32). Trauma cases were reduced according to 35 respondents. Outpatient clinics were stopped initially and transferred in virtual clinics (telemedicine). Approximately 40% of respondents were afraid of infecting others (patients, family) and 25% admitted to drink more heavily. Ninety percent of respondents reported an income loss of > 15% (range 0–100%). Conclusion: Orthopaedic surgeons and their patients have been significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Cancellation of surgeries has created an increased backlog of 32,400 orthopaedic surgeries in British Columbia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has expedited the implementation of telemedicine, which will be a long-lasting benefit in providing healthcare. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]",,2021,2021-02-26,[],False,,

Therefore., we sought to determine the timing of the source to sink transition for a sub-boreal clearcut. Clearcuts such as the one documented in this study occurring on glaciolacustrine deposits with relatively poor drainage represent about 20% of the 1.5 million ha in the Prince George area.

A Bowen ratio approach in combination with a bottom-up modeled NEE based on ecosystem component CO2-flux measurements was used for years 5 and 6. In years 8 and 10, growing season NEE was measured using an open-path eddy covariance system. A cross comparison of Bowen ratio and eddy covariance systems was performed and measurements agreed relatively well (r(2) = 0.58).

Tributary and headwater temperatures that are not available prior to 1993 are estimated with both linear regression and neural network techniques. The average root mean square difference between model temperatures and those observed at Hell's Gate, on the lower Fraser River, is computed to be 1.12 degreesC. Historical flow and temperature observations are also used to establish patterns and trends for the Fraser River watershed. The Julian day numbers by which one-third and one-half of the integrated yearly discharge had occurred were computed and found to be progressing earlier at the rates of 0.11 and 0.09 days per year, respectively. Both values are significant at the 95% level. Average summer Hell's Gate temperatures from 1941 to 1998 are warming at the rate of 0.012 degreesC per year, though the relatively large standard error of 0.008 degreesC means that this result is not significantly different from zero at the 95% level. However, when the analysis is restricted to 1953 to 1998, the trend becomes 0.022 degreesC per year and the significance level rises to 98%. An analysis of the 1953-98 atmosphere-to-river heat exchange at Kamloops and Prince George produces positive increases of 0.52 W m(-2) per year and 0.90 W m(-2) per year, respectively. When these trends are used to force the river temperature model, they explain approximately 35% of the 1953-98 temperature increase at Hell's Gate. An additional 20% is explained by related increases in the headwater and tributary temperatures. Though these estimates have considerable statistical uncertainty, they nevertheless suggest that most of the river warming can be attributed to climatic effects. Flow rates and river temperatures are also shown to exhibit significant differences in the summers following El Nino and La Nina winters. On average, during the summers following El Nino events, flows are approximately 800 m(3) s(-1) smaller and river temperatures are approximately 0.9 degreesC higher on the lower Fraser River.

The distribution of the pathology curriculum required meeting 3 specific challenges: (i) implementation of high-quality technologies to facilitate distribution; (ii) recruitment of pathologists to teach; and (iii) creation of an electronic pathology learning center. Technological needs were met by a state-of-the-art audiovisual system allowing simultaneous interactive didactic sessions across all 3 sites, and by the use of a digital ""virtual slide"" system. Recruitment of pathologist educators proved challenging owing to comparatively limited staffing levels at the rural site. A physical and virtual pathology learning center was developed to assist students in self-directed study. Student performance on pathology examinations has proven to be essentially identical pre- and post-distribution, and is equivalent across all 3 sites. Quantitative and qualitative student survey data show that distributed pathology instruction is overwhelmingly well received by medical students at all sites, that pathologists' expertise is very important to students, and that pathology is one of the most popular components of the distributed curriculum. Pathology education continues to be a vital part of a distributed undergraduate medical program, and student grades and feedback demonstrate the value of the teaching and the technologies we have used. To be implemented successfully, the distribution of pathology education requires considerable financial and infrastructure investment, and ongoing commitment from pathologists and university administrators.

This study reports the morphology (size, roundness, sphericity) of 1636 gold grains, ranging in size from 0.25 to 17 mm, recovered from 19 placer mines. Older gravels contain the smallest gold grains (mean grain size 1.53 mm), grains of intermediate size occur in till (2.23 mm) and the coarsest gold occurs in postglacial gravels (2.34 mm) with a mean of 1.93 mm for the mining district as a whole.

In-situ growth of coarse, angular grains is indicated by a ''composite'' grain structure, consisting of aggregates of gold particles welded together by high-grade (Ag = < 2%) filamentous gold; in-situ coarsening may be reliant on organic complexing agents produced below a dense forest cover. An evolutionary sequence of grain form, from angular aggregates to rounded ''pumpkin seed'' grains, is suggested. Rounded grains commonly show a crystalline structure which may result from the cold hammering of gold during transport; fracturing along crystal boundaries is common.

Although this protocol uses high-resolution aerial imagery, the MFLNRO is also collecting beetle imagery at a smaller scale for detecting and monitoring. For this evaluation, we use a combination of ground- and imagery-based assessments as developed for FREP within the BC Interior Plateau.

The inland volcanic belt runs parallel to the coast, and the rocks were emplaced mainly within extensional basins indicating volcanism was attributed to rift-related decompressional melting. The rocks include both talc-alkaline and tholeiitic mafic and intermediate types (i.e., low-Fe, medium-Fe, and high-Fe suites). Voluminous volcanic units (Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, Swans Lake) of the Buck Creek volcanic complex (similar to 3,000 km(2) in area) within the Nechako plateau erupted within 1-2 million years and show significant internal chemical variability. All rock types have similar Sr-Nd isotopic (Sr-87/Sr-86(i)= 0.70435-0.70487; epsilon(Nd)(t). +2.6-+-4.0) ratios indicating they originated from the same sub-Cordilleran mantle source. Petrological modeling using the most primitive rocks of the Buck Creek, Goosly Lake, and Swans Lake magmatic pulses demonstrates that the chemical variability observed in each system can be explained by hydrous fractional crystallization in the upper crust (<= 0.1 GPa) under moderately oxidizing to oxidizing conditions (Delta FMQ 0 to +0.7). The primary difference between the low-Fe to medium-Fe (talc-alkaline) Buck Creek suite model and the high-Fe to medium-Fe (tholeiitic) Swans Lake suite model is water content as the Swans Lake model has lower (H2O = 0.75 wt.%) starting water than the Buck Creek and also the Goosly Lake models (H2O =1.25-2.00 wt.%). Moreover, the intermediate to silicic rocks of the complexes are compositionally similar to rocks associated with ""slab failure"" suggesting that rifting and mantle melting were related to asthenospheric upwelling through a slab tear. The implications are that the chemical variability of the rock suites are primarily related to fractional crystallization and that the mantle source is heterogeneous with respect to water content which is likely due to heterogeneities in the processes related to pre-Eocene subduction.",10.2113/2022/9441099,2022,2022,[],False,,

Delta-top changes are interpreted from surface channel morphology, riverbank exposures, hand auger data, vibracores and other borehole records. River channel and overbank sediments are related to source area contributions in terms of granule lithology and fine (<63 mum) fraction geochemistry. A substantial area of the northeast delta-top floodplain dates from the early Holocene, and is characterized by fragmentary, low-discharge paleochannels with bed material characteristic of the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Floodplain development since ca. 4.0 ka BP has been limited to the western and southern areas of the delta and records persistently higher sediment loads, aggradation and larger, more active channels. These changes reflect overall shifts from warm, dry Hypsithermal to cooler, wetter Neoglacial climatic conditions defined regionally. The composition of both laterally and vertically accreted floodplain sediments plus channel morphology and floodplain stratigraphy record the changing influence of partially glaciated source areas on the Holocene sediment flux. Specifically, periods of climatic deterioration and possibly glacier expansion lead to relatively greater yields of carbonate-rich sediment from the higher elevation Moose River sub-basin. Storage and reworking of sediments on the Moose Lake delta-top floodplain influence interpretation of the more distal lacustrine record. Over the last 4000 years, gradual increases in lacustrine sedimentation rate of up to similar to 18% are inferred to result from delta progradation. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

The <63 mum fraction is emphasized for its relative mobility and ease of analysis using instrumental neutron activation. Overall, the composition of the stream sediments closely reflects bedrock distribution. Samples dominated by limestone and dolostone, calcite and dolomite, and related elements (Ca, Mg, Sr etc.) correspond to Lower and Middle Cambrian carbonate bedrock largely confined to the Moose River sub-basin. Clastic and non-quartzite metamorphic lithologies, primary and secondary aluminosilicate minerals and related elements (Al, Cs, Rb etc.) are largely derived from Miette Group bedrock and associated with the uppermost Fraser River sub-basin. Except in the case of the Moose River/Fraser River junction, the determination of proportional tributary contributions is complicated by variable or delayed mixing, localized floodplain or valley side sources, and limited contrast between source areas. At present the Moose River sub-basin contributes a greater proportion of the total and fine-grained sediment loads of the combined Fraser River than would be expected from drainage basin area alone. The imbalance is related to greater relief, precipitation and runoff in the Moose River sub-basin; however, the spatial association of carbonate-rich stream sediments, ice cover and carbonate bedrock exposure indicates that glaciers play a particularly important roll in generating fine-grained fluvial sediment. Since differences in glacier cover and glacier potential in the two major sub-basins are likely to be persistent, and since relative sediment yields from the sub-basins can be determined from sediment composition, a potential indicator of glacier variation and climate change during the Holocene is therein available.

Basal diamicts are unconformably overlain by coarse sand and silt deposited as turbidity currents in an ice-dammed lake during final retreat of Wisconsinan ice. Rapid withdrawal of the valley glacier resulted in a fully developed Moose Lake followed by low rates of sediment input for much of the early and middle Holocene until approximately 4,100 years BP. At that time, sediment input doubled and then tripled by 3,120 years BP in response to cooling and several phases of regionally documented glacier expansions. The transition from the Altithermal dry/warm period to the Neoglacial cooling is coincident with the formation of varves at Moose Lake which provide a chronology of changing Neoglacial sediment inputs. The glacier-climate signal recorded in Moose Lake sediments suggests distinct thresholds for changes in sedimentation style that are dependent on both climatic and geomorphic conditions affecting the watershed. Early in the record, direct connection to glaciogenic sediment production produced highly variable sedimentation rates that ended abruptly as the ice-front retreated. In the middle record, climate conditions that led to greatly reduced ice extent and lower sediment production in the upper Fraser and Moose river watersheds, changed abruptly resulting in varve formation. The change in style and increased sedimentation was caused directly by greater seasonal variations in sediment input due to climate-controlled glacier advances beyond modern limits. While sediment supply is a factor, comparison of the sediment record with tree-ring responses to climate change suggest both summer temperature and winter precipitation are important controls of Holocene variations in sediment yield.",10.1080/11035899901213202,1999,1999,[],False,,

We examine scenarios where a localized monochromatic source along the magnetopause boundary launches MHD fast mode ultralow frequency (ULF) waves into the magnetosphere, where they couple to shear Alfven waves. Sharply peaked field line resonance (FLR) structures are found to form at discrete locations within the magnetosphere in response to the fast mode driver. The extent in local time and relative amplitudes of FLR structures are found to depend strongly on the source location along the magnetopause boundary, indicating how the addition of day/night asymmetry affects the penetration of MHD fast waves within the magnetosphere. This also suggests that observed FLR structures within the magnetosphere may be used to deconvolve the spatial characteristics of the ULF wave source at the magnetopause, giving insight to the excitation mechanism responsible for observed ULF waves. As an example, we consider narrow band ULF activity observed on 25 November 2001 during a high solar wind speed interval following a geomagnetic storm and qualitatively reproduce the spatial and temporal characteristics of observations made by the Prince George SuperDARN radar by constraining the ULF wave source characteristics.",10.1029/2010JA015410,2010,2010,[],False,,

The carbonatite is classified as a calcio- to ferro-carbonatite. Sodic-fenitization is common around the carbonatite and the degree of alteration and frequency of syenite occurrences increase away from the carbonatite plug. The rare earth mineralogy of the Wicheeda carbonatite was defined through the use of petrography, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The REE mineralogy is complex, with multiple stages of primary, late-stage, rapidly cooling crystallization. The mineralogy consists of Ca-REE-fluorocarbonates [including bastnasite-(Ce), parisite-(Ce), and synchysite-(Ce)], Ba-REE-fluorocarbonates [including cordylite-(Ce), kukharenkoite-(Ce), cebaite-(Ce), huangnoite-(Ce), and qaqarssukite-(Ce)], ancylite-(Ce), monazite-(Ce), euxenite-(Y) and allanite-(Ce); the majority of which are LREE-rich.

River otters (Lontra canadensis) have been used as a model species for toxicological studies on the effects of MeHg bioaccumulation due to their position as an apex predator in aquatic systems and sensitivity to environmental disturbance. Although laboratory studies suggest that sublethal MeHg exposure may have detrimental effects on wildlife, they are limited in their ability to reflect real world exposure and forecast population level effects. Few studies have identified the threshold at which MeHg exposure results in a population-level effect for wild populations of river otters in marine or freshwater systems. We used a series of data sets collected over a 7-year period for river otter populations in central British Columbia, Canada, to assess mercury concentrations (river otter fur) and measurements of population status and health relative to a lake with an inactive and reclamated mercury mine along its shoreline (Pinchi Lake). We used a combination of remote cameras, marked individuals, hair snares, and scat counts/inventories to collect measurements of population status and health including: activity levels, population estimates, sex ratios, group sizes, litter sizes, behaviour, stress hormones, diet, and habitat quality. We found that mercury concentrations in river otter inhabiting Pinchi Lake were significantly higher than all other lakes in the study, and were also high relative to other areas in Canada and the United States. We did not, however, detect significant differences between the two lakes in many of the population parameters measured. We discuss the knowledge gaps and challenges of identifying the effects of MeHg for wild populations of mammals, determining sensitive and appropriate methods for measuring these effects, and the implications of our results for monitoring the impacts of natural resources activities. Detailed studies on population effects across a range of exposure and background conditions are required to address these data deficiencies. Typically, river otters are not included as monitoring species in environmental assessments even though their value as an indicator of anthropogenic contaminants has clearly been documented.

We observed distorted sex ratios, attributable to a temperature manipulation during embryonic development, in experiments conducted during 1991 with the anadromous and nonanadromous (kokanee) forms of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) from Takla Lake, British Columbia. Sex ratios ranged from 62 to 84% female, and the biased ratio could not be accounted for by differential mortality by sex. The effect was observed independently in sockeye and kokanee crosses, as well as in the reciprocal hybrids. Similar crosses from Takla Lake in a previous year (1989) in which incubation temperature was not manipulated resulted in normal (1:1) sex ratios. Other populations of sockeye and kokanee from the same year (1991) but undergoing no temperature manipulation maintained normal sex ratios, as did populations from several disparate locations and years (1986-1994). The parsimonious conclusion is that the temperature manipulation during development was responsible for the biased sex ratio through a direct influence on sex differentiation. Hence, the possibility that temperature-dependent sex determination occurs in O. nerka, and perhaps other salmonids, deserves rigorous testing.",10.1139/f95-152,1996,1996,[],False,,

In Hypothesis A, representative of a family of models based on geologic evidence, the Insular and Intermontane superterranes and the Intervening mid-Cretaceous Coast Mountains orogen were situated in their present positions relative to cratonic North America, 90 my ago. In the alternative Hypothesis B, based on paleomagnetic data, the Insular superterrane and the Coast Mountains orogen along: its eastern edge were situated 3000 km south of their present positions, 90 my ago. This crustal element, Baja British Columbia, then moved northward between 90 and 70 Ma along the hypothetical, coast-parallel, Baja B.C. fault system. At 70 Ma, Baja British Columbia was Juxtaposed with the western part of the Intermontane superterrane, which lay 1100 km south of its present position. Between 70 and 50 Ma, the composite block moved northward an additional 1100 km along the hypothetical Intra-Quesnellia fault, located within the Intermontane superterrane. A goal of the hypothetico-deductive scientific method is the elimination of false hypotheses using empirical tests. A review of the logical arguments governing this method shows that if two contradictory hypotheses are judged to have non-negligible prior probabilities-if both have a significant likelihood of being true-then a crucial test can potentially lead to the refutation of one hypothesis and provide empirical support for the alternative. A crucial test is possible when an observational prediction of one model is prohibited by an alternative model. To evaluate whether hypothesis A or B can be ruled out by geologic evidence, we propose four crucial tests independent of paleomagnetic tests. To test the Baja British Columbia hypothesis, potentially useful geologic evidence includes: (1) the provenance of detritus in mid-Cretaceous strata in the Methow and Tyaughton basins; (2) the provenance of detritus in pre-late Campanian strata in the Nanaimo Group; (3) offset geologic features in BaJa British Columbia matching counterparts in southwestern California and northwestern Mexico; and (4) Late Cretaceous or older geologic features limiting offset across the transcurrent Baja B.C. fault to < 1000 km.",10.2475/ajs.297.2.117,1997,1997,[],False,,

Tatin Lake, Hanson Lake and the Counts Lakes are within Middle Jurassic felsic intrusive rocks of the Francois Lake plutonic suite. The objectives are to determine: (i) the extent to which lake sediment geochemistry reflects the presence of adjacent porphyry Mo prospects; (ii) distribution patterns of Mo and other elements in lake sediments, and (iii) the effectiveness of lake sediments as a regional Mo exploration medium. Bottom waters of Tatin Lake are anoxic below 15-17 m depth and a range of limnological regimes, from eutrophic to oligotrophic, are present in three sub-basins. Mo-Cu mineralization occurs northwest of the lake. Hanson Lake is thermally unstratified, with sub-oxic to anoxic conditions occurring locally below 4-5 m depth. A Mo-Cu showing is present about 2.5 km south of the lake, and there is an extensive area of elevated Zn-Pb-Cu in soils to the north. The Counts lakes are a group of small, mostly eutrophic, lakes and ponds downslope of known Mo mineralization. Sediments at Tatin, Hanson and the Counts Lakes contain elevated median Mo concentrations of 8 ppm (max: 23 ppm), 7 ppm (max: 55 ppm) and 42 ppm (max: 165 ppm), respectively, relative to regional background of 1-2 pm. Mo distribution patterns are influenced by proximity to mineralization, basin morphology, limnological variations and the high organic matter content of centre-basin sediments. The distribution of Mo in lake sediments reflect the locations of adjacent quartz-molybdenite veins and their dispersed remnants in soil and till. Anomaly patterns are interpreted to be of hydromorphic origin, with Mo transported to lake basins in sub-surface ground water and, to a lesser extent, surface waters prior to complexing by organic-rich sediments. Most of the highest Mo concentrations in Tatin Lake are in the west end of the lake (up to 14 ppm), in near-shore shallow-water organic sediments near Mo-Cu mineralization and in profundal sediments of the westernmost sub-basin. There is a close association between the distribution of Mo and Lot. Elevated Mo concentrations (11-18 ppm) are closely associated with centre-lake profundal sediments in Hanson Lake. Sediment geochemical patterns in the Counts Lakes are strongly influenced by proximity to Mo mineralization, with the highest Mo concentrations (max: 165 ppm) in the westernmost ponds downslope of known prospects. Centre-basin results from Tatin Lake (12, 7-10, 23 ppm), Hanson Lake (11-12 ppm) and the Counts lakes (49, 160, 60, 33, 38, 56, 54, 83 ppm) exceed regional background by 3-80x. Elevated centre-basin Mo concentrations of at least 12 ppm reflect the presence of adjacent porphyry Mo mineralization. Centre-lake sediments do not however always have the highest Mo concentrations, due to variations in Mo content between sub-basins of the same lake and to the presence of near-shore Mo zoning patterns downslope and down drainage of mineralization. Centre-lake sampling of every lake and sub-basin is recommended for regional geochemical surveys. For follow-up surveys, near-shore sediments should also be sampled, particularly at base of slope and adjacent to drainage inflows, to delineate any lateral zoning patterns which may infer a general direction toward buried mineral deposits.

The problems posed by sampling of surficial materials for Au analysis are well known, but no field investigations have been made into the most appropriate size of lake sediment samples to collect in this part of the Cordillera. Samples collected with the Hornbrook-type sampler typically weigh 50 to 100 g when dry, and doubling the size of the field samples might be expected to yield more representative and reliable An concentrations. To test this hypothesis, a comparative study of two field sample sizes was conducted in Clisbako Lake, adjacent to the Clisbako epithermal gold prospect, to ascertain whether or not there are significant differences in Au concentrations with increasing sample size. Clisbako Lake is located about 100 km west of Quesnel in the Fraser Plateau, an area of low to moderate relief and extensive drift cover. Gold occurs in quartz stockwork and silicified breccia zones within a low-sulphidation adularia-sericite epithermal system hosted in Eocene continental volcanics. Two corresponding lake sediment samples were collected at each of 36 sites: a standard sample obtained from a single drop of the sampler, and a second, larger sample obtained by combining sediment from two drops of the sampler. Sediments were dried, disaggregated and pulverized in a ceramic ring mill prior to analysis for An and additional elements by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Gold concentrations in the centre of the profundal basin (4-8 ppb) are considerably greater than the regional median of 1 ppb in the Nechako Plateau to the north. Elevated concentrations of Au, As (median: 25.5 ppm) and Sb (median: 3.1 ppm) in lake sediments reflect the geochemistry of adjacent zones of epithermal mineralization and alteration. Median concentrations of 9 ppb Au over the entire lake were obtained for both standard and large-size sample suites, and gold distribution patterns are similar for both sample sizes. Equivalency of population means were tested with a two-sample paired duplicate t-test and single-factor analysis of variance (ANOVA) on 34 sample pairs. Results indicate that there is no significant difference between Au concentrations of the standard and large-size lake sediment samples. There is no evidence to suggest that use of larger, more costly, lake sediment samples are more effective or reliable indicators of epithermal Au mineralization in this region than standard-size samples. The standard samples are satisfactory media for regional and property-scale lake sediment geochemical surveys. (C) 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",10.1016/S0375-6742(97)00030-7,1997,1997,[],False,,

Floodwater travelled 330 km down the valley to Hope, British Columbia, and from there to the west into the Salish Sea near Vancouver. The flood was caused by the failure of an ice dam formed by the terminus of glaciers flowing from the central Coast Mountains across the British Columbia Interior Plateau. The ice dam impounded several hundred cubic kilometres of water to a maximum elevation of about 810 m asl (above sea level); at its maximum, the lake at the ice dam was over 250 m deep. Geomorphic and sedimentary evidence for the flood includes streamlined boulder-strewn bars, gravel dune fields, and terraces sloping up Fraser and lowermost Thompson valleys, opposite the present direction of river flow. The gravel bars and flood terraces are underlain by sheets of massive to poorly sorted gravel containing large boulders and rip-up clasts of silt and till. Shortly after the flood, a landslide near the northern margin of the former glacier dam impounded water to an elevation of about 550 m asl. This lake emptied due to overflow and incision of the landslide dam. The outburst flood from glacial Lake Fraser and the subsequent draining of the landslide-dammed lake deeply incised the older sediment fill in Fraser Valley and transported much of this sediment into the protoSalish Sea west of Vancouver, British Columbia and Bellingham, Washington.

Binary logistic regression modelling was used in an attempt to predict variables leading to runway incidents with coyotes at YXS. The highest supported logistic regression model predicting coyote incidents included the variables ‘weekday’, ‘month’ and ‘season’. Although data from camera traps did not help to predict incidents, trend data collected from camera traps mirrored coyote incident data, suggesting that camera traps are useful for capturing times of the day and seasons of the year in which coyotes are active at the airport. Suggestions are provided as to how cameras might be used to track the movement of animals more accurately and what other data could be useful in helping to build risk assessments and models to predict aircraft incidents with mammals of interest.",,2021,2021-06-01,[],False,,

Plants were randomly assigned to treatment categories so that the apical meristems of 50 plants each were assigned to a control or were clipped on one of the following dates 6 weeks apart: 1 June, 16 July, and 30 August 2005. The leader of each aspen was clipped and dieback was left to progress until the onset of winter dormancy. Our results showed that the earlier the simulated browsing occurs in the growing season, the greater the length of stem dieback, up to the maximum of the subapical axillary node below the point of clipping. The average rate at which dieback progressed varied between treatments and decreased throughout the growing season.

A methodology is introduced that corrects gravity data for changes in overburden thickness through the use of a bedrock topography map created by integrating information from a helicopter transient electromagnetic survey with geological survey data, well water data, and gravel pit locations. The approach is tested for a 68 km x 38 kin area in the prospective Nechako interior plateau of British Columbia, Canada. The methodology extends the traditional Bouguer corrections by taking into account the gravitational contribution of the overburden. Results show that the capability of an airborne survey to detect a change in overburden thickness depends primarily on survey line spacing and to a lesser extent on the level of random noise in the gravity data.

In the summer of 2000, trees were vertically uprooted in Prince George, BC using a tripod and winch device to determine if seed source and nursery culture significantly affected the root strength of 5-year-old paper birch. Trees from a seed source in the Skeena region had the greatest uprooting resistance, and the most root biomass, but the least root strength compared to the other three seed sources tested. The Skeena trees may be exhibiting an adaptive strategy which provides maximum root reinforcement across a wide range of environments. Uprooting resistance was similar for the 415D stocktypes grown at Red Rock and Kalamalka nurseries. However, trees grown in 515A styroblock at Kalamalka had the least uprooting resistance and root biomass of all treatments. In addition, the relationship between uprooting resistance and ground line diameter was different between nurseries. The results of this study suggest that regardless of height and diameter leaving the nursery, seed source root resistance and growth continued to be impacted by nursery culture 5 years after planting.

Data were collected by aerial photographic analysis and field observation. Postglacial sediment sources are major gullies created by debris slides and flows, failures in glaciolacustrine terraces, and stream channel degradation. Depositional landforms consist of talus slopes and colluvial and alluvial fans. Contemporary sediment sources include debris slides and flows in established gullies and minor processes on hillslopes.

In 2008, Geoscience BC acquired 330 km of deep vibroseis reflection profiles on the plateau, mostly over the Stikinia arc terrane, but also over its eastern contact with the oceanic Cache Creek terrane. All seven seismic reflection lines reveal a strongly reflective lower crust that extends from 7 to 9 s down to the Moho, which is defined by the downward termination of reflectivity at 11- 12 s. In the uppermost crust, extension occurred by block faulting with faults soling into subhorizontal to shallowly dipping detachments above 10 km depth. Extension in the deeper upper and middle crust, which was partly controlled by antiforms likely related to earlier shortening, was accommodated on a network of anastomosing shear zones that sole out into the top of the reflective lower crust. The lower crustal reflections correlate with seismic P- wave velocities of 6.45- 6.98 km/ s, indicating that the reflective lower crust has a more mafic composition than the middle crust. As in other extensional settings, we suggest that this pervasive fabric of reflectors arises from the intrusion of mantle- derived basaltic magma into zones of ductile shearing, and that differentiation of these melts resulted in the widespread Paleocene to Eocene volcanism. Reflector dips indicate that extension was approximately east- west, consistent with north- northwest- trending horsts separated by basins filled with Paleocene to Eocene volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks.",10.1139/cjes-2013-0142,2014,2014,[],False,,

A series of logistic regression analyses were used to distinguish ever versus never been screened as well as recency of previous screening. Participation rates in screening mammography in Prince George are comparatively high; however, no association was found between social factors and previous mammography use. This suggests women in Prince George are participating in mammography services regardless of social background. Participation rates in Pap test screening in Prince George are high and are similar to provincial averages; however, while a large percentage of women have been screened, this percentage varies across social groups. Immigrant women, single women, and women with less education are over represented among women who have never had a Pap test. In addition, older women are less likely to obtain a recent Pap test when compared to younger women. This study suggests that certain groups of women in northern British Columbia experience low participation in health services, resulting in a higher risk for poor health and a poor quality of life.",10.1023/A:1021269216516,2002,2002,[],False,,

This study examined the utility of chemical and morphological characteristics of PM10 collected and archived by the BC Ministry of Environment, Land and Parks from three monitoring stations to determine the possible sources of PM10 during selected episodic and non-episodic events. Samples from three episodic events (24 h PM10 levels > 50 mug m(-3)) and three non-episodic events (24 h PM10 levels < 50 mug m(-3)) in 1995-1996 were examined using a scanning electron microscope with energy dispersive system. Results show that rounded. spherical and oval shaped particulate were diagnostic for combustion sources, while irregular-shaped particulate were dominant in all samples including road dust. The particulate size distributions indicated that combustion sources contributed more to < 2.5 mum fraction while geologic material is responsible for particulate with diameter between 3 and 4 mum. Principal component analysis of in situ chemical composition suggests that high concentrations of aluminum, silicon and magnesium are indicative of geologic material while carbon. sodium and sulphur are indicative or combustion and industrial sources. Our study suggests that in Prince George. episodic events were influenced by geologic material while the non-episodic events are impacted by industrial, combustion and to some extent by geologic materials. We also found that the combined use of particulate morphology and elemental composition has a good potential to distinguish between geologic material and industrial, combustion sources of PM10 in the Prince George airshed.

Relative to the historical discharge, the upper Nechako River has experienced the greatest degree of water abstraction, and the lower survival of chinook broods originating from the upper river may be due to early emergence of fry caused by elevated fall and winter water temperatures or to higher rates of predation on juveniles and loss of rearing habitat caused by the elimination of the spring freshet.

Apatite in several porphyry copper deposits in British Columbia has a unique set of physical and compositional characteristics that can be used to evaluate the chemical conditions of magmas that formed the causative intrusions or associated hydrothermal alteration. Apatite under visible light and SEM shows no notable variations between unaltered and altered varieties but cathodoluminescence reveals significant differences. Apatite in unaltered rocks displays yellow, yellow-brown, and brown luminescence, whereas in K silicate-altered rocks apatite displays a characteristic green luminescence. The green-luminescent apatite replaces yellow-or brown-luminescent apatite and locally overgrows it. Apatite occurring with muscovite (i.e., phyllic)-altered rocks displays characteristic gray luminescence. The chemistry of apatite, as determined by electron microprobe and laser ICP-MS analyses, directly reflects its alteration and luminescence. The unaltered yellow-luminescent apatite has high concentrations of Mn (0.3-0.5 wt % MnO) and a high Mn/Fe ratio (>1), whereas the brown-luminescent apatite has low Mn, but higher concentrations of S and REE + Y. The green K silicate alteration-related luminescence is caused by lower Mn/Fe ratios (ca. 1) along with depletions of other trace elements such as Cl, S, and Na. Gray-luminescent apatite occurring with muscovite-altered rocks results from significant Mn loss (<0.15% MnO) contemporaneous with depletion in Na, S, Cl, and REE during low pH phyllic alteration in calc-alkalic porphyry deposits. The correlation between apatite texture, luminescence, and chemical composition with the type and intensity of porphyry alteration offers a potentially fast and effective method to utilize it as an indicator for porphyry mineralization in a range of exploration materials including soils, regoliths, and heavy mineral concentrates from glacial and fluvial materials.",10.2113/econgeo.111.6.1397,2016,2016,[],False,,

Urban and exurban landscapes can offer much needed habitat to these space-demanding creatures, thereby buffering habitat losses in other areas and protecting populations of these species, but only if conflicts between these animals and humans can be managed and minimized. In the case of urban black bears, they can become quickly labled as a ""problem"" bear if they become too reliant on human garbage or other food sources such as fruit trees. A ""problem"" bear usually becomes a dead bear. In collaboration with the Northern Bear Awareness Society in Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, UNBC researchers undertook two surveys of Prince George over a 3 year period and a companion survey in the city of Coquitlam, BC to examine attitudes towards urban bears. The research found that residents of both cities, in spite of regular and close encounters with black bears, strongly supported the presence and preservation of bears within an urban setting, largely due to conservation concerns.

Design/methodology/approach The authors have all participated in the development, design and/or delivery of the course and have provided their reflections on the experience. In addition, they sought insights from students and other interested people on the impact and significance of this course. Findings Carbon and energy management is an action learning-based co-created course initiated by the Chamber to address an interest in mitigating climate change amongst local businesses. Among businesses, the carbon economy is under considerable discussion. The increased awareness of climate change, and the need to better manage carbon, has led to local businesses eager to reduce greenhouse gases but lacking the expertise necessary. UNBC students (undergraduate and graduate) learn innovative and practical skills through creating carbon footprint analyses for small- to medium-sized business/non-profit clients, providing recommendations on reducing reliance on fossil fuels and formally presenting their findings to their clients. After five years, 46 businesses and non-profit organizations have participated in the course along with over 30 students and 5 separately hired student interns. The Chamber is now rolling out the program for Canadian Chamber of Commerce interested in similar community-university partnerships. Originality/value This paper describes a course that is a novel approach to university-community partnerships, both in approach and focus area. The linking, through the course, of small- to medium-sized businesses with the provision of plans for carbon reduction developed by university students is an unusual approach. However, there is significant value to all partners in the approach. Allowing the main community partner to serve as the lead in the project also offers an unusual experience and perspective for the university partner, as often such partnerships are largely driven by the post-secondary institution's interests and needs, which can create a challenging power dynamic. Instead, the course offers a lesson in how a university can be clearly in service to the community at the community's invitation. Finally, this paper offers reflections on the value of this type of project for creating sustainability initiatives from the perspective of all participants, students, faculty, university administration, city government, participating businesses and the Chamber of Commerce, demonstrating the critical need for understanding a project as an intersection of all participating actors.",10.1108/IJSHE-02-2020-0071,2020,2020,[],False,,

Measurements in 2008 and 2009 indicate that this net canopy reduction has reduced peak snowpack and melt rate differences between remaining stands (including large clearcuts, younger regenerating stands and dead mature pine stands), relative to a healthy forest canopy with smaller clearcuts. The Distributed Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model (DHSVM) was calibrated and run at 200 m resolution across the catchment, and simulated snowmelt rates and snow-covered area compared relatively well to distributed satellite or ground-based measurements. Snowpack and ablation rates were 10-20% higher during the 2008 and 2009 winters than when running the model for the pre-MPB landscape in 2000 using the same input meteorological data, resulting in almost no difference in the snowcover period. A greater snowpack volume which enters the stream network faster inevitably has implications for streamflows, flood risks and water resources, and these are assessed during the next stage of this research project.

Two-hundred and ninety-six plots, 25.2 m in diameter, were examined to determine the incidence of I. tomentosus, and several sire and soil variables were measured. These included soil moisture and nutrient regime, slope position, soil texture, soil coarseness, humus form, spruce density, tree species composition and soil pH. The incidence of I, tomentosus infection ranged from none to 31% of spruce trees per plot. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in percent infection were found between soil moisture regimes, soil moisture by soil nutrient regimes, and slope position. All of these site and soil variables are used, in British Columbia, to determine a 'site series', which is a site specific ecological classification unit used to determine harvest methods and silviculture prescriptions.

Watersheds over which multiple observation types are available can potentially further benefit from data assimilation by having multiple updated states from which hydrologic predictions can be generated. However, the magnitude and time span of the impact of the assimilation of an observation varies according not only to its type, but also to the variables included in the state vector. This study examines the impact of multivariate synthetic data assimilation using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) into the spatially distributed hydrologic model CEQUEAU for the mountainous Nechako River located in British Columbia, Canada. Synthetic data include daily snow cover area (SCA), daily measurements of snow water equivalent (SWE) at three different locations and daily streamflow data at the watershed outlet. Results show a large variability of the continuous rank probability skill score over a wide range of prediction horizons (days to weeks) depending on the state vector configuration and the type of observations assimilated. Overall, the variables most closely linearly linked to the observations are the ones worth considering adding to the state vector due to the limitations imposed by the EnKF. The performance of the assimilation of basin-wide SCA, which does not have a decent proxy among potential state variables, does not surpass the open loop for any of the simulated variables. However, the assimilation of streamflow offers major improvements steadily throughout the year, but mainly over the short-term (up to 5 days) forecast horizons, while the impact of the assimilation of SWE gains more importance during the snowmelt period over the mid-term (up to 50 days) forecast horizon compared with open loop. The combined assimilation of streamflow and SWE performs better than their individual counter-parts, offering improvements over all forecast horizons considered and throughout the whole year, including the critical period of snowmelt. This highlights the potential benefit of using multivariate data assimilation for streamflow predictions in snow-dominated regions.",10.5194/hess-20-4375-2016,2016,2016,[],False,,

Completion of development (Kemano Completion Proposal), at a cost of over $2 billion, would divert 84 percent of the initial mean annual discharge of the N echako R iver, and 62 percent of the mean annual d ischarge of the N anika River in the Skeena catchment area, to the Kemano River.

These include interference with migration of adults, changes in the quality of spawning gravel, imposition of stress on all stages of the f ish f rom high total gas pressures and from alterations in ambient temperature, changes in the composition of the total fish community, changes in the production and availability of food, stranding of fish, weakening or loss of cues for homing, and increased exposure to predation from fish and birds. A major diff iculty in trying to relate effects to salmon populations lies in distinguishing fish numbers as determined by habitat effects, from numbers determined by the level of recruitment to the rivers as a result of exploitation by the fishery. Three approaches to the problem are; experimental design of impact assessment, modelling changes of discharge and salmon habitat, and analysis of case histories of regulated discharge. The last seems to be the most instructive per unit of effort required. As an approximation to obtaining replication of treatment effects, and to judge the reliability of prediction of effects of llow regulation, case hislories of regulated salmonid rivers were examined, lt was found that negative effects outnumbered positive ones, that prediction was usually incorrect, and that, even where flow regulation was implemented with the express intention of increasing numbers of salmonids the results fell short of expectations. On this evidence it appears that the outcome of a development as demanding of wateras Kemano Completion is difficult to predict in precise quantitative terms and carries some risk for natural ooDUlations.",10.4296/cwrj1101014,1986,1986-01,[],False,,

The lake formed during the decay of the last Cordilleran Ice Sheet and drained-11,500 years ago during a large outburst flood. The fronts of a delta and two subaqueous fans consisting of silt to fine sand are marked by branching networks of wide, nearly flat channels that terminate upstream in digitate, steep-walled amphitheatres. We propose that these channel amphitheatre landforms formed by liquefaction flowslides that were induced by the rapid drawdown of glacial Lake Fraser during the outburst flood. Similar geomorphic forms, which we believe also to be associated with rapid drawdowns of large Late Pleistocene-early Holocene lakes, occur elsewhere in North America. A recent tailings dam failure and an intentional breaching of a 100-year-old hydroelectric dam provide insights into the processes responsible for the landforms. By using geomechanical analysis, we show how rapid lake drawdown can trigger liquefaction flowslides in deposits of silt to fine sand. The novelty of our approach lies in combining geomechanical reasoning with geomorphic analogues to understand histories of ancient glacier-dammed lakes and of the glacial lake outburst floods that are sourced from them.

A 16-member ensemble of SWAT hydrological model (HM) simulations, based on a comprehensive ensemble of the Canadian Regional Climate Model (CRCM) simulations driven by two global climate models (GCMs), with five realizations of the Canadian CGCM3 and three realizations of the German ECHAM5 is established per catchment. This study aims to evaluate, once model bias has been removed by statistical post-processing (SP), how the RCM-simulated climate changes differ from those of the parent GCMs, and how they affect the assessment of climate change-induced hydrological impacts at the catchment scale. The variability of streamflow caused by the use of different SP methods (mean-based versus distribution-based) within each statistical post-processing pathway of climate model outputs (bias correction versus perturbation) is also evaluated, as well as the uncertainty of natural climate variability. The simulations cover 1971–2000 in the reference period and 2041–2070 in the future period. For a set of criteria, results based on raw and statistically post-processed model outputs for the reference climate are compared with observations. This process demonstrates that SP is important not only for GCMs outputs, but also for CRCM outputs. SP leads to a high level of agreement between the CRCM and the driving GCMs in reproducing patterns of observed climate. The ensemble spread of the climate change signal on streamflow is large and varies with catchments and hydrological periods (winter/summer flows). The results of various hydrological indicators show that most of the uncertainty arises from the natural climate variability followed by the statistical post-processing. The uncertainty linked to the choice of statistical pathway is much larger than that associated with the choice of the method in quantifying the hydrological impacts. We find that the incorporation of dynamical downscaling of global models through the CRCM as an intermediate step in the GCM–RCM–SP–HM model chain does not lead to considerable differences in the assessment of the climate change impacts on streamflow for the study catchments.",10.1016/j.jhydrol.2014.11.047,2015,2015-01,[],False,,

The mainstem of the river could be considered to have three distinct reaches where water quality properties were relatively constant. Cluster analysis was a useful technique for establishing similarities and differences for both the tributaries and the mainstem stations. Some limitations of water quality data and the methods used are discussed.

Current support for IRBM is based on a ‘myth’ of inter‐agency co‐ordination. However, increasing complexity and uncertainty in river basin systems has created ‘wicked’ or ‘messy’ land and water management problems. The limited capacity of state institutions to deal effectively with such conditions suggests that the current ‘myth’ must be reformed and that a more powerful system‐response capability founded on inter‐organisational collaboration should be developed. The case for a collaborative institutional approach to IRBM is examined with reference to the Fraser Basin Council in British Columbia, Canada.",10.1080/15715124.2004.9635235,2004,2004,[],False,,

Censuses were conducted during spring, summer, autumn, and winter to investigate how use of riparian habitat changed seasonally. Stream-side riparian zones were characterized by a dense understorey of deciduous vegetation not found in the upslope forest. Nine bird species preferred the riparian understorey for breeding, six preferred it only during migration. Neotropical migrants (16 of 46 species) were more closely associated with stream-sides than year-round residents (11 species). Some breeding birds (five species) were significantly negatively associated with riparian habitats. The density of riparian birds declined with distance upstream but did not decline up to 250 m away from the stream. The more extensive riparian areas downstream supported a greater density of birds in all seasons compared to upstream areas, but more species only in spring and autumn. Species that nested in non-riparian areas in summer used riparian habitat in autumn, making riparian corridors in the northern coniferous forest important during migration.

The present study aims to assess statistical bias correction under nonstationary bias conditions and its implications on the simulated streamﬂow over two snowmelt-driven Canadian catchments. A pseudoreality approach is employed in order to derive a proxy of future observa- tions. In this approach, CRCM–ECHAM5 ensemble simulations are used as pseudoreality observations to correct for bias in the CRCM–CGCM3 ensemble simulations in the reference (1971–2000) period. The cli- mate model simulations are then bias corrected in the future (2041–70) period and compared with the future pseudoreality observations. This process demonstrates that biases (precipitation and temperature) remain after the bias correction. In a second step, the uncorrected and bias-corrected CRCM–CGCM3 simulations are used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) hydrological model in both periods. The bias correction decreases the error on mean monthly streamﬂow over the reference period; such ﬁndings are more mixed over the future period. The results of various hydrological indicators show that the climate change signal on streamﬂow obtained with uncorrected and bias-corrected simulations is similar in both its magnitude and its direction for the mean monthly streamﬂow only. Regarding the indicators of extreme hydrological events, more mixed results are found with site dependence. All in all, bias correction under nonstationary bias is an additional source of uncertainty that cannot be neglected in hydrological climate change impact studies.",10.1175/JHM-D-14-0159.1,2015,2015-07-06,[],False,,

This research reflects collaboration with ethnobotanists, linguists and Indigenous speakers and knowledge holders of First Nations’ languages, and includes recording the names and conceptual relationships of plant species and other plant categories. Identification of factors influencing plant nomenclature and shaping plant classification systems, and how these systems have changed over time and vary from language to language, has been a focus of the research. Most BC First Nations languages incorporate names for between about 120 and 150 different species or basic “generic rank” categories of plants. These tend to be arranged in a shallow hierarchy within a small number of higher order plant categories, such as for “tree,” “bush,” “grass.” In some culturally important species, more detailed sub-categories, within the “generic” taxa, are distinguished with more specific names.

Simultaneously, a Dothistroma needle blight epidemic in northwest BC has been responsible for killing thousands of hectares of pine plantations and has even resulted in the death of mature trees, which is unprecedented. Both of these globally significant forest pest epidemics have been linked to climate change. The beetle epidemic has grossly exceeded the scale of all previously recorded outbreaks, in large part due to a lack of cold winters. In this sense, the link to global warming is relatively straightforward and foreseeable. Of all climate change projections, the prediction of an increase in winter temperatures has been associated with as high a degree of confidence as any. The Dothistroma needle blight epidemic and its link to climate change were not so predictable. Based on weather records over the past four decades, short-term increases in mean summer precipitation correlate closely with historical records of Dothistroma outbreaks in the northwest. The current most severe outbreak has occurred during a prolonged period of above-average summer precipitation. An increase in summer precipitation would more typically be thought of as beneficial for forests, but that increase in moisture has improved the conditions for a pathogen that has outweighed any benefits. Similar trends of increasing incidence and severity for other forest pathogens in BC appear in areas that have been receiving increased summer precipitation. Conversely, in the southern interior of the province decreased summer precipitation and increased drought conditions are resulting in stressed trees which can favour root diseases. Early indications are that climate change will have profound effects on forest health. Some effects will be more predictable than others.",10.1080/07060661.2011.563908,2011,2011,[],False,,

The Fraser River is the longest waterway in BC and supports the world’s most abundant Pacific Ocean salmon populations. Previous modeling and observational studies have demonstrated that the FRB is a snow-dominated system, but with climate change, it may evolve to a pluvial regime. Thus, the goal of this study is to evaluate the changing contribution of snow to the hydrology of the FRB over the latter half of the twentieth century. To this end, a 0.25° atmospheric forcing dataset is used to drive the VIC model from 1949 to 2006 (water years) at a daily time step over a domain covering the entire FRB. A model evaluation is first conducted over 11 major subwatersheds of the FRB to quantitatively assess the spatial variations of snow water equivalent (SWE) and runoff (R). The ratio of the spatially averaged maximum SWE to R (RSR) is used to quantify the contribution of snow to the runoff in the 11 subwatersheds of interest. From 1949 to 2006, RSR exhibits a significant decline in 9 of the 11 subwatersheds (with p < 0.05 according to the Mann–Kendall test statistics). To determine the sensitivity of RSR, the air temperature and precipitation in the forcing dataset are then perturbed. The ratio RSR decreases more significantly, especially during the 1990s and 2000s, when air temperatures have warmed considerably compared to the 1950s. On the other hand, increasing precipitation by a multiplicative factor of 1.1 causes RSR to decrease. As the climate continues to warm, ecological processes and human usage of natural resources in the FRB may be substantially affected by its transition from a snow to a hybrid (nival/pluvial) and even a rain-dominated system.",10.1175/JHM-D-13-0120.1,2014,2014-03-25,[],False,,

We now face the challenge of managing these populations to avoid extirpation. Two goals of this study were to identify extinction thresholds related to small size and inadequate habitat for this species. The minimum viable population size (MVP) is the threshold size above which populations support recruitment and grow and below which populations fail to support recruitment and decline. We estimated a single, cross-population MVP using data from multiple populations and quantile regression, which removed the effects of factors other than population size. Only two populations (those in the Bonneville and Dalles reservoirs on the Columbia River), both with significant increasing trends, were larger than our MVP estimate. We detected significant decreasing trends in two populations—those below Bonneville Dam and in the Kootenai River. To discover how site-specific differences in river habitat influence MVP, we used a population viability analysis (PVA) model that incorporated Allee mechanisms. The PVA model identified a river segment length below which extinction was certain regardless of initial population size. Above this threshold, simulated populations in river segments that were longer or that provided more frequent recruitment opportunities were able to persist with smaller initial sizes. Two priorities emerged for white sturgeon: monitoring age structure and understanding the circumstances preventing recruitment to age 1. Our results ultimately guided us toward thresholds in rearing habitat and age structure that promise to develop into more useful conservation tools than MVP for this and similar long-lived species.",10.1577/T09-069.1,2010,2010-09-01,[],False,,

A flow-duration curve represents the annual flow-frequency characteristics of rivers by depicting the cumulative frequencies for average ranked flows in a river. Generally the process requires the empirical estimation of the mean flow at each of 365 ranks. A model requiring only five parameters is developed by combining the principles of order statistics and traditional flow-frequency analyses and is applied to flow-duration curves for rivers in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Results from the model may be interpreted both statistically and physically and allow the identification of hydrologically similar regions. Streamflows in British Columbia are generated from a number of distinct physical processes operating in highly diverse environments. The mixture of the streamflow-generating processes requires that the statistical model be capable of encompassing the different flow-frequency regimes. Identification of hydrologic regions also depends on the inclusion of these generating processes. The model presented incorporates the physical generating processes of streamflow in both the statistical representation of flow-duration curves and their interpretation. Similarly, the spatial model presents hydrologic regions that correspond to the known physical environment.

BC forest biomass has also become a major source of wood pellets, exported primarily for bioenergy to Europe, although the sustainability and net carbon emissions of forest bioenergy in general are the subject of current debate. We simulated the temporal carbon balance of BC wood pellets against different reference scenarios for forests affected by MPB in the interior BC timber harvesting area using the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3). We evaluated the carbon dynamics for different insect-mortality levels, at the stand- and landscape level, taking into account carbon storage in the ecosystem, wood products and fossil fuel displacement. Our results indicate that current harvesting practices, in which slash is burnt and only sawdust used for pellet production, require between 20–25 years for beetle-impacted pine and 37–39 years for spruce-dominated systems to reach pre-harvest carbon levels (i.e. break-even) at the stand-level. Using pellets made from logging slash to replace coal creates immediate net carbon benefits to the atmosphere of 17–21 tonnes C ha−1, shortening these break-even times by 9–20 years and resulting in an instant carbon break-even level on stands most severely impacted by the beetle. Harvesting pine dominated sites for timber while using slash for bioenergy was also found to be more carbon beneficial than a protection reference scenario on both stand- and landscape level. However, harvesting stands exclusively for bioenergy resulted in a net carbon source unless the system contained a high proportion of dead trees (>85%).

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000–2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m-2 yr-1 on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to 75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959–1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses.",10.1038/nature06777,2008,2008,[],False,,

Results show that First Nation forest sustainability issues are in effect a combination of forest conditions and values. Inclusion of forest values in C&amp;I frameworks is necessary because: (1) aboriginal communities do not dissociate culture from the environment and thus forest values from forest condition, (2) they have an impact on resulting forest management strategies and decisions, and (3) they offer a holistic approach to sustainability issues and a better picture of local environmental contexts.",10.1016/j.foreco.2007.12.051,2008,2008,[],False,,

Variation at 14 microsatellite loci was surveyed for sea-type and lake-type Sockeye Salmon and Kokanee sampled from 121 populations in the two river drainages. An index of genetic differentiation, F-ST, over all populations and loci was 0.087, with individual locus values ranging from 0.031 to 0.172. Standardized to an ecotype sample size of 275 individuals, the least genetically diverse ecotype was sea-type Sockeye Salmon with 203 alleles, whereas Kokanee displayed the greatest number of alleles (260 alleles), with lake-type Sockeye Salmon intermediate (241 alleles). Kokanee populations from the Columbia River drainage (Okanagan Lake, Kootenay Lake), the South Thompson River (a major Fraser River tributary) drainage populations, and the mid-Fraser River populations all clustered together in a neighbor-joining analysis, indicative of a monophyletic origin of the Kokanee ecotype in these regions, likely reflecting the origin of salmon radiating from a refuge after the last glaciation period. However, upstream of the mid-Fraser River populations, there were closer relationships between the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype and the Kokanee ecotype, indicative of the Kokanee ecotype evolving independently from the lake-type Sockeye Salmon ecotype in parallel radiation. Kokanee population structure within the entire Fraser River drainage suggested a polyphyletic origin of the ecotype within the drainage.

This review of recent research focuses on the themes of sediment yield, land-use impact, fine-sediment transport, bed material transport and river morphology and numerical modelling of fluvial landscape development. Research on sediment yield and denudation has confirmed that Canadian rivers are often dominated by riparian sediment sources. Studies of the effects of forestry on erosion, in-stream sedimentation and habitat are prominent, including major field experimental studies in coastal and central British Columbia. Studies of fine-sediment transport mechanisms have focused on the composition of particles and the dynamics of flocculation. In fluvial dynamics there have been important contributions to problems of turbulence-scale flow structure and entrainment processes, and the characteristics of bedload transport in gravel-bed rivers. Although much of the work has been empirical and field-based, results of numerical modelling of denudational processes and landscape development also have begun to appear. The nature of research in Canada is driven by the progress of the science internationally, but also by the nature of the Canadian landscape, its history and resource exploitation. Yet knowledge of Canadian rivers is still limited, and problems of, for example, large pristine rivers or rivers in cold climates, remain unexplored. Research on larger scale issues of sediment transfer or the effects of hydrological change is now hampered by reductions in national monitoring programmes. This also will make it difficult to test theory and assess modelling results. Monitoring has been replaced by project- and issues-based research, which has yielded some valuable information on river system processes and opened opportunities for fluvial scientists. However, future contributions will depend on our ability to continue with fundamental fluvial science while fulfilling the management agenda.

The Kemano project of the Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd. begun in 1950, was the largest industrial scheme in the area. A key feature of the first stage of it was a dam which diverted about 40% of flow of the south branch of the Nechako River, through a tunnel in the mountains, to the Pacific Ocean. In 1987 an agreement for the Kemano Completion Project (KCP), which would have diverted 87% of the flow, was signed. This final phase of the project would have put important fisheries resources of the upper Fraser River at high risk. Mitigation for fisheries protection were inadequate or untested in the system at the time. Potential cumulative impacts of water abstraction, elevated pollution levels, increased water temperature and natural sediment were not addressed. In January 1995 KCP was cancelled but there remain at present no adequate measures to protect the fish and the river ecosystem. These measures are to be negotiated in the future. Future management of the whole Kemano development must provide biologically realistic flow and temperature regimes in the Nechako River, and must deal with cumulative impacts of population and industrial growth. To achieve ‘sustainability’ of fisheries in the Nechako River and upper Fraser watershed the present approach to the Kemano development must be changed fundamentally. The future of the Kemano development must be set in the context of the whole future of the upper Fraser system. Continued growth and development, as has occurred in the upper Fraser and total basin, can not go on without inimical changes to ecosystem conditions and loss of fisheries resources.",10.1007/BF00222540,1996,1996-10-01,[],False,,

Many hope that collection and monitoring of such indicators will provide important policy guidance to decision-makers and provide a means for tracking sustainable development. This project was designed with the following goals: (i) to select indicators that could be linked to an operational definition for sustainable development within the Fraser River Basin (British Columbia); (ii) to assess the accessibility, quality and relevance of the best available data for developing such indicators; (iii) to apply modeling techniques for discerning the linkages among indicators; and (iv) to provide recommendations for further indicator selection and modeling research. The major methodological conclusions reached were: (i) it is important to link sustainable development goals to movements of a small slate of individual indicators as single indicators can rarely be linked to any specific sustainable development goal; (ii) the poor quality, inaccessibility and irrelevance of existing data are pervasive constraints to reliable indicator modeling; (iii) modeling is most appropriate at aggregated spatial scales such as provinces or large watersheds, while modeling at smaller ecosystem-based spatial levels is feasible but unreliable; and (iv) linking the use of deterministic and qualitative modeling approaches is a useful means for projecting indicators and discerning important policy linkages, while conventional statistical modeling approaches are frequently inappropriate because of unreliable or non-commensurable data. This has profound implications for indicator selection and modeling. In contrast to much of the current indicator work, which relies on selecting a large number of detailed specific indicators, it would be more fruitful and less costly to focus attention on a small number of indicators within selected indicator classes (such as economic, social, environmental or human health indicators). The precise specification of the indicator within each of these classes is of less consequence. Indicator modeling work should focus on larger scale systems, as opposed to smaller ecosystem units. Such work is most suited to identifying qualitative policy trade-offs and implications, rather than to forecasting specific indicators. Data gathering efforts can be scaled down substantially and should be informed, but not unduly constrained, by available model frameworks. Greater focus is required on modeling frameworks that can use incomplete data sets or qualitative information, and linking existing quantitative model structures to external qualitative models.",,1999,1999,[],False,,

We demonstrate how the anti-homophony effect is best understood in a diachronic-evolutionary context rather than a synchronicphonological one: “epenthesis” is really the blocking of syncope (as a regular historical sound change).

Making his headquarters at Fort Vancouver, in the State of Washington, he travelled up and down the Columbia by canoe or on foot, sometimes with an Indian guide, sometimes with the Hudson’s Bay Company’s men, but often alone with his dog. Difficult and exhausting as were his journeys, he was happy in the rich harvest of plants which he obtained. His expectations were fully realized. During the six months following his arrival in the country he collected about 500 different specimens (499 to be exact), obtaining as far as possible from 12 to 24 samples of each specimen. Little escaped the keen observation of the young student of natural history. His attention was not confined to vegetation; specimens of birds, insects, and animals were also obtained. After two years’ painstaking labour in the Columbia River region from 1825 to 1827, and a very hard journey south towards California to find the sugar pine he returned to England. After a two years’ sojourn in England, during which he was feted and lionized for his botanical discoveries, he came back to Western America in 1830. This time he came trained and equipped for doing work quite different from that formerly undertaken, having added the taking of geographical and astronomical observations to his former pursuits. Leaving Fort Vancouver March 20, 1833, he travelled with the express as far as Fort Okanagan. Douglas also undertook the making of field-sketches along the route and did a continuous series of the country travelled from Fort Okanagan to the Quesnel River, showing the natural configuration, with notes on trees, vegetation, and soil. Leaving Fort Kamloops the brigade went on to Fort Alexandria, where the horses were changed for boats. The journey was also up-stream on the Nechako and Stuart rivers. Douglas went up the Nechako to Fort Fraser, on Fraser Lake, and probably went overland from there to Fort St. James. After a very brief stay at Fort St. James, during which he took some observations, he and Johnson embarked in a small birch-bark canoe and descended the Stuart and Nechako rivers. At Fort George they stayed a day or two with George Linton, clerk in charge there, and then began descending the Fraser. And now disaster was added to disappointment. On June 13, at the “Stony Islands,” as he called them, they were wrecked in the rapids; the canoe was smashed to pieces. Douglas was carried down the rapids and into the whirlpool below, and he was swept about in the turbulent waters for an hour and forty minutes, before being washed on to the rocky shore. He lost everything he had except his instruments, his astronomical journal, notes and charts, and his barometrical observations. The last months of Douglas’s life were spent in the Sandwich Islands. He arrived in Honolulu in December, 1833, and spent the next few months in exploring the island of Hawaii. He collected a large number of ferns.

In August, 1834, while crossing the island alone with his dog he fell into a pit used for trapping wild cattle, and was gored to death. Some say he was pushed in, and in this way murdered for his money. Whichever it was, it was a horrible death, and an untimely one, for he was only 34 years old.

The purpose of this study was to collaborate with City staff and other organizations to undertake action-oriented research with the goal of creating a local adaptation strategy. Steps taken toward this goal included: producing downscaled climate scenarios; facilitating a workshop with local practitioners to prioritize impacts; gathering public feedback regarding impacts; and triangulating sources of information to determine community adaptation priorities. Changes to forests and increased flooding are the top local adaptation priorities, and impacts related to transportation, severe weather and water supply are high priorities.

The abundance of P released from the fine glaciolacustrine, and organic rich sediments was resulting in excess algal and weed growth. It was postulated that iron-phosphate reduction at redox potentials below approximately 200 mV and/or bacterially mediated orthophosphate (PO4-P) releases could be occurring. The development of an appropriate nutrient management strategy required that the process associated with the sediment P release be determined. The MINTEQA2 geochemical model was used to predict the release of orthophosphate (PO4-P) into the interstitial water with the assumption that P is present alternately as strengite, variscite and hydroxyapatite. The predicted release of PO4-P from these P containing minerals was compared to the concentration of PO4-P and total phosphorus (TP) in the overlying hypolimnion. In order to improve the accuracy of the model prediction, the proportion of the sediment present as iron-bound phosphate was estimated. A significant correlation between the observed hypolimnetic TP and interstitial PO4-P concentrations as predicted from iron-bound P dissolution (r(2) = 0.59) was found. Total phosphorus release rates to the hypolimnion were also found to be strongly correlated to the iron-bound P component of the sediment (r(2) = 0.88). Multivariate regression analyses showed significant relationships between hypolimnetic PO4-P and sediment iron-bound P, Eh, and interstitial Fe (r(2) = 0.76). These results provided sufficient evidence to conclude that PO4-P in the system is predominantly bound to Fe-containing minerals and therefore could be managed using treatment techniques that address iron-bound phosphates.

Among Aboriginal communities, distrust of police is common, due partly to legacies of colonial policing. In response to the paucity of research among Aboriginal people who use drugs, this paper aims to: (1) Describe the policing experiences of young Aboriginal people who use drugs; (2) Identify policing activities associated with unsafe injection practices; and (3) Elucidate barriers to positive police relations. Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. This mixed-methods study (N=372) used period prevalence from 2007 to 2010 to describe policing experiences, mixed effects regression models to identify correlates of policing activities, and thematic qualitative analysis to assess attitudes to police relations. Results: Many participants were stopped by police (73%), experienced physical force by police (28%), had drug equipment confiscated (31%), and changed location of drug use because of police (43%). Participants who reported dealing drugs (40%) were significantly more likely to experience police engagement. Among participants in Prince George, 4% reported to have had non-consensual sex with members of the criminal justice system. Policing activity was significantly associated with syringe sharing, rushed injection, and reused syringe. Due to personal experience, practical concerns, and intergenerational legacies of unfair policing practices, most participants did not want a positive relationship with police (57%). Desire for a positive relationship with police was directly associated with being helped by police, and inversely associated with being stopped by police and experiencing physical force by police. Conclusion: Policing activities may be impacting the well-being of Aboriginal people who use drugs. Due to focused prosecution of street-level drug dealing, some police may favor enforcement over harm reduction.

As part of the modernization, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins), Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (CCB) were affected. Prescribers and pharmacists had six months to discuss the changes with patients, and change medications if deemed necessary. Purpose: To quantify the changes made to prescriptions and to adjust to the Modernized Reference Drug Program. Methods: A retrospective chart review was conducted at two clinics in Prince George, BC. Charts for patients that were prescribed any drugs in the affected classes were reviewed to determine if, and when, they had been changed, and by which health care professional. In December 2016, a clinical pharmacist, integrated within the study clinics, informed prescribers of the changes, and made patient-specific clinical notes within the charts. The notes described the changes and recommended alternative agents and appropriate dosing in order to assist the prescriber to have a conversation with the patient regarding the switch. Results: Out of 429 unique patients, 233 patients were prescribed a Statin, 229 patients an ACEI, 110 an ARB and, 83 a CCB. Sixty-five drug changes were indicated to reflect the modernization, and with guidance from a clinical pharmacist, nurse practitioners (NPs), and family physicians (FPs), 65% of these identified drugs were switched to reflect the modernization. Community pharmacists made no drug changes in the study sample, despite the prescriptive authority and compensation available to do so.

The watershed provides critical reproductive habitats for anadromous chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and sockeye salmon (O. nerka) and year-round habitat for the endangered Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus) population. In this study, the chemical quality of sediment in the upper Nechako River and its major tributaries was examined for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), legacy organochlorine (OC) pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and furans (PCDFs), labile (exchangeable) metals/metalloids, and major nutrients (N and P). sigma PCB and sigma PBDE were detected in channel bottom sediments at all Nechako River and tributary sites; hexachlorobenzene (HCB) and 4,4 '-DDE (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) were also detected at most sites. Organophosphorus and phenoxy acid herbicides were not detected in any samples. While sigma PCB, sigma PBDE, HCB, and 4,4 '-DDE concentrations in bottom sediments were always well below provincial and federal guidelines for the protection of aquatic life, concentrations of total labile As (As-T), Cr-T, Cu-T, Fe-T, Mn-T, Ni-T, and Zn-T in suspended and/or bottom sediments often exceeded provincial threshold effect levels (TEL) and, in some cases, approached or exceeded probable effect levels. Distinct Cu-T, Ni-T, Pb-T and Zn-T concentration maxima in suspended sediments were linked to road and urban densities. Historical PCDD, PCDF and PAH data show that concentrations in bottom sediment samples were highest at a site in the lower Nechako River between Miworth and the City of Prince George where PCDD and PCDF concentrations exceeded the interim federal TEL. Nitrogen and P concentrations in bottom sediments were negatively correlated with water velocity and sediment texture; the evidence suggests that reductions in velocity resulting from the 1952 diversion of the Nechako River have increased the nutrient content of bottom substrates.",10.1080/07011784.2018.1531063,2019,2019,[],False,,

A large amount of road-deposited sediment (RDS) lies on the road network of Prince George, a city of about 80,000 people, in British Columbia, Canada. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the total mass of RDS within the city, and how this varied over time and space; and (2) to determine the temporal and spatial variations in the particle-size fractions of the RDS. Materials and methods Samples of RDS were collected using a grid network during two different time periods in the snow-free season in 2009. Composite samples for each grid (n = 46) were fractionated into five grain-size classes (> 500, 250-500, 125-250, 63-125, < 63 mu m) using stainless steel sieves. Fractionated sediment samples were weighed to obtain a mass for each size class for each grid cell. Results and discussion The total amount of RDS (all particle-size fractions) in the city of Prince George was estimated to be 746 x 10(3) and 204 x 10(3) kg for the summer and fall 2009 sampling periods, respectively. Based on a total road length of 1,030 km within the sampled area of the city, this equates to an average of 724 and 198 kg per km of road, for the summer and fall sampling periods, respectively. The RDS was dominated by the > 500-mu m fraction, and there was a trend of decreasing amounts (by mass) for the finer particle-size fractions. In terms of the most important particle-size fraction from an air and water quality perspective, the < 63-mu m particle-size fraction accounted for, on average, 6.5% and 4.8% of the total RDS mass for the summer and fall 2009 sampling periods, respectively; it is estimated that an additional approximately 2% was lost to the air during sample collection, and thus values may be closer to 9% and 7%, respectively. This equates to averages of between 47-61 and 10-13 kg per km of road for the summer and fall periods, respectively. Total amounts of RDS were greatest in the city centre, compared to the outlying areas, reflecting the greater density of roads in the former, although there were some hotspots which may reflect land use activities such as light-industry and pulp and paper mills. Conclusions These findings have implications for air and water quality in the city and surrounding area, including the role of RDS in contributing to airborne fine particulates (i.e. PM10 and PM2.5) and the fine-grained sediment (< 63 mu m) transported within storm sewers to receiving waterways, such as the Fraser and Nechako Rivers.",10.1007/s11368-011-0383-y,2011,2011,[],False,,

Results show good performances of the particle filters with improvements of the accuracy of initial conditions by more than 65% compared to simulations without data assimilation for both the hydrological and the thermal component. All thermal forecasts returned continuous ranked probability scores under 0.8 degrees C when using a set of 40 initial conditions and meteorological forecasts comprising 20 members. A greater contribution of the initial conditions to the total uncertainty of the system for 1-dayforecasts is observed (mean ensemble spread = 1.1 degrees C) compared to meteorological forcings (mean ensemble spread = 0.6 degrees C). The inclusion, of meteorological uncertainty is critical to maintain reliable forecasts and proper ensemble spread for lead times of 2 days and more. This work demonstrates the ability of the particle filters to properly update the initial conditions of a coupled hydrological and thermal model and offers insights regarding the contribution of two major sources of uncertainty to the overall uncertainty in thermal forecasts.

This study examined numerical simulations of precipitation over the Terrace-Kitimat Valley, an industrializing corridor in the Coast Mountains of northern British Columbia, Canada. Modelling uncertainty was explored for 1 year of output from the Weather Research and Forecasting model at 1-km grid spacing for three atmospheric forcing datasets and two planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes. The observed total precipitation ranged from 1170 to 2380 mm and was often underestimated by more than 40% when using the North American Regional Reanalysis as atmospheric forcing data or the Mellor-Yamada-Nakanishi-Niino level 3 (MYNN3) parameterization as PBL scheme. Persistent low bias from model configurations using these configurations suggested that merely selecting an alternative atmospheric forcing dataset does not ameliorate systematic error occasioned by a poorly performing PBL parameterization. Hence, the choice of the PBL scheme and the meteorological dataset is important for spatial estimation of precipitation using WRF. Model output best corresponded with annual gauge measurements when simulations with the Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ) PBL scheme were forced with ERA5. The North American Mesoscale Analyses (NAM-ANL) however demonstrated better performance for monthly variation and high-intensity precipitation than ERA5.

PM2.5 mass, sulphate (SO42-) and light absorbing carbon (ABS) were determined for all samples and the relationship between ambient concentration and personal exposure was investigated. Overall, lower particle exposures and a lower personal-ambient regression slope were found for Prince George children compared to results from other longitudinal studies of children. This suggests that in this setting indoor environments may have less influence from ambient sources and greater influence from non-ambient sources. Comparison of personal exposures and ambient concentrations for each individual indicated higher Spearman correlations for SO42- (median = 0.95) and ABS (median = 0.73) compared to total PM2.5 mass (median = 0.55). A large degree of individual variability in the personal-ambient correlation was found for PM2.5 mass, while SO42- showed very consistent results, supporting its use as an indicator of exposure to particulate matter of ambient origin. ABS was slightly more variable than SO42- due to the influence of non-ambient or very local sources in a low number of samples. The impact of local meteorology was also investigated and inversion conditions were connected to all high ambient levels (> 30 mu g m(-3)). In addition, associations were found between inversion strength and personal exposure. This finding suggests that reduction of ambient concentrations during stagnant periods would result in lower personal exposure levels.

Average ambient levels and personal exposures during this time period were 13.8 mu g m(-3) and 16.4 mu g m(-3) respectively. From the data pooled across individuals, use of the two different tracers indicated identical estimates of median exposure to ambient PM2.5 (7.5 mu g m(-3)) and similar estimates of non-ambient generated exposure (6.4 and 5.0 mu g m(-3)) and infiltration (0.49 and 0.52) for the sulphate and elemental carbon approach, respectively.

These results support the use of elemental carbon as a tracer of ambient generated exposure and the use of ambient data as estimates of longitudinal changes in children's exposure in this setting. The importance of both ambient and non-ambient sources of PM2.5 is emphasized by their almost equal contribution to total personal exposures.

We have adopted this approach to examine the relatedness among natural isolates of two uncharacterized caterpillar-infecting baculoviruses, Malacosoma californicum pluviale nucleopolyhedrovirus (McplMNPV) and Malacosoma disstria nucleopolyhedrovirus (MadiMNPV), which infect two closely related host species with little to no cross-infectivity. We designed two degenerate primers (BVP1 and BVP2) based on protein motifs conserved among baculoviruses. McplMNPV and MadiMNPV viral DNA was obtained from naturally infected caterpillars collected from geographically distinct sites in the Southern Gulf Islands and Prince George regions of British Columbia, Canada. Sequencing of 0.9 kb PCR amplicons from six McplMNPV and six MadiMNPV isolates obtained from a total of eight sites, revealed very low nucleotide variation among McplMNPV isolates (99.2-100% nucleotide identity) and among MadiMNPV isolates (98.9-100% nucleotide identity). Greater nucleotide variation was observed between viral isolates from the two different caterpillar species (only 84.7-86.1% nucleotide identity).

While Indigenous rights, inherently tied in Canada to recognition by the settler colonial state, have limited application in achieving social justice or decolonization for Indigenous peoples, we argue that Indigenous rights can be used as a complementary discourse to Indigenous resurgence, within broader discourses of Indigenous justice, to lend legal and political weight to arguments for cultural safety and human rights in health care.

There is, however, evidence that more complex introgressive relationships are common in nature. Here, we use field observations and genomic analysis, including the sequencing and assembly of a novel reference genome, to study an emergent hybrid zone involving two colliding hybrid zones of three woodpecker species: red-breasted, red-naped, and yellow-bellied sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus ruber, S. nuchalis, and S. varius). Surveys of the area surrounding Prince George, British Columbia, Canada, show that all three species are sympatric, and Genotyping-by-Sequencing identifies hybrids from each species pair and birds with ancestry from all three species. Observations of phenotypes and genotypes of mated pairs provide evidence for assortative mating, though there is some heterospecific pairing. Hybridization is more extensive in this tri-species hybrid zone than in two di-species hybrid zones. However, there is no evidence of a hybrid swarm and admixture is constrained to contact zones, so we classify this region as a tension zone and invoke selection against hybrids as a likely mechanism maintaining species boundaries. Analysis of sapsucker age classes does not show disadvantages in hybrid survival to adulthood, so we speculate the selection upholding the tension zone may involve hybrid fecundity. Gene flow among all sapsuckers in di-species hybrid zones suggests introgression probably occurred before the formation of this tri-species hybrid zone, and might result from bridge hybridization, vagrancies, or other three-species interactions.",10.1111/mec.16650,2022,2022,[],False,,

Wildlife responses to forestry cutblocks (defined areas where trees were harvested) vary as a function of forest succession, which differs across systems. Across their distribution, moose (Alces alces) and forestry are often closely associated. Moose are predicted to select for cutblocks because of greater browse quantity in early successional vegetation, but moose responses to cutblocks are inconsistent across studies. Our objective was to compare moose spatial responses to cutblocks as a function of year since cut between study areas (Prince George South [PGS] and Bonaparte [BP]) while considering differences in vegetation composition and regrowth to better inform forestry planning in British Columbia, Canada. We characterized cutblocks by dominant tree species as a proxy for vegetation composition and estimated the normalized burn ratio (NBR) from multispectral satellite imagery as an index of vegetation regrowth (i.e., structure). We then examined the use of cutblocks by moose dependent upon vegetation composition and NBR using generalized additive mixed effects models. Next, we used locations of collared moose and nearby available locations to examine moose responses as a function of year since cut and used those responses to group cutblocks into age classes, which were incorporated into resource selection functions (RSF) to compare moose responses between study areas. Vegetation composition differed between study areas, and although cutblocks in both study areas followed similar regrowth trajectories, NBRs for cutblocks > 13 years post-logging in PGS exceeded those in BP. Moose demonstrated greater use of locations within cutblocks with intermediate NBRs and dominanted by spruce (Picea engelmannii x glauca) versus Douglas fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca). Moose responses as a function of year since cut varied seasonally, but across seasons, moose tended to avoid new cutblocks (1-8 years), select for regenerating cutblocks (9-24 years), and avoid older cutblocks (25-40 years). In both study areas, RSFs revealed that moose avoided new cutblocks, but moose in PGS were more likely to select for regenerating cutblocks in comparison to BP. Our analyses suggest that the use of cutblocks by moose is a function of year since cut, vegetation composition, and vegetation regrowth, likely resulting from differences in browse quantity and lateral cover. To maintain stable moose populations, managers should consider vegetation composition and regrowth during forestry planning, and future research should focus on identifying region-specific forestry thresholds for moose.",10.1016/j.foreco.2020.118763,2021,2021,[],False,,

The factors associated with transitioning to the use of injection drugs among young Aboriginal people in Canada are not well understood. Methods: The Cedar Project is a prospective cohort study (2003-2007) involving young Aboriginal people in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia, who use illicit drugs. Participants' venous blood samples were tested for antibodies to HIV and the hepatitis C virus, and drug use was confirmed using saliva screens. The primary outcomes were use of injection drugs at baseline and tranisition to injection drug use in the six months before each follow-up interview. Results: Of 605 participants, 335 (55.4%) reported using injection drugs at baseline. Young people who used injection drugs tended to be older than those who did not, female and in a relationship. Participants who injected drugs were also more likely than those who did not to have been denied shelter because of their drug use, to have been incarcerated, to have a mental illness and to have been involved in sex work. Transition to injection drug use occurred among 39 (14.4%) participants, yielding a crude incidence rate of 19.8% and an incidence density of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years. In unadjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use was associated with being female (odds ratio [OR] 1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.06-3.72), involved in sex work (OR 3.35, 95% CI 1.75-6.40), having a history of sexually transmitted infection (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.07-3.78) and using drugs with sex-work clients (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.19-5.32). In adjusted analysis, transition to injection drug use remained associated with involvement in sex work (adjusted OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.45-10.71). Interpretation: The initiation rate for injection drug use of 11.5 participants per 100 person-years among participants in the Cedar Project is distressing.

In the period from August to November 2001, a variety of procedures were used to ensure that all eligible residents of the Valley received a copy of our questionnaire, and 687 useable questionnaires were obtained for our working dataset. Health status was measured by SF-36 and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control healthy days items. Thirty-one items were used to measure the Provincial Health Officer's designated determinants of health in four clusters, namely, biological, social and economic, health behaviours and health services determinants. Quality of life was measured by satisfaction levels in 13 specific domains of life (e.g., family, financial security), four global items (e.g., happiness, life satisfaction) and one global Subjective Well-Being Index. Besides obtaining baseline figures on all our measures for the Valley, we made some comparisons among our figures and those from other areas, e.g., Prince George, BC. Most of the measures indicated that the health status and quality of life of Bella Coola Valley residents were lower than those of Prince George residents. For the sample as a whole, SF-36 scores on the eight dimensions ran from 82.3 (physical functioning) to 50.0 (social functioning), with a mean of 62.7. Residents in the Valley averaged 6.5 days in the past 30 in which their health was physically not good, 5.5 days when it was mentally not good and 4.1 days when their health limited their usual daily activities. Eleven percent of respondents described their general health as ""excellent"" and another 27% said it was,'very good"". On a 7-point scale from 1 = very dissatisfied to 7 = very satisfied, respondents had average life satisfaction and satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores of 5.5. For specific domains of life, the lowest mean level of satisfaction was reported for federal and provincial government officials (3.3) and the highest was reported for living partners and personal safety around home (5.8). Regarding bivariate relations, each of the eight dimensions of SF-36 was significantly correlated with a single item measure of general health, and five of the eight were significantly correlated with the number of good health days. Happiness and the Subjective Well-Being Index were positively but moderately correlated with six of the eight dimensions, and life satisfaction was positively correlated with five. Age was negatively related to general health, but positively related to life satisfaction. Not being of aboriginal descent was positively related to all of the four global health indicators and to the Subjective Well-Being Index. Education was positively related to the four global health measures but not to the three global quality of life measures. The Social Support and Good Family Indexes were positively related to all seven global measures. There was a positive correlation between six of the seven global measures and the frequency with which respondents participated in activities sponsored by voluntary organizations. Frequency of smoking was negatively associated with every global dependent variable except the Physical Health Index. Frequency of skipping meals was negatively associated and average hours of sleep per night was positively associated with all seven global measures. Trning to multivariate relationships, the four clusters of health determinants explained from 12% (SF-36 Mental Health Index) to 24% (general health) of the variance in the dependent global health variables, and from 20% (happiness) to 26% (Subjective Well-Being Index) of the variance in the dependent global quality of life variables. Adding domain satisfaction scores to the total set of predictors allowed us to explain from 20% (SF-36 Mental health Index) to 29% (general health) of the variance in the dependent global health variables, and from 39% (happiness) to 62% (life satisfaction) in the dependent global quality of life variables. By including measures of social support and good family relationships in our set of health determinants, we practically guaranteed that the latter would be relatively strongly predictive of global quality of life.",10.1007/s11205-004-4512-5,2005,2005,[],False,,

A total of 875 people completed 23-page questionnaires, the average age of the respondents was 69 and the range ran from 55 to 95 years. Responses to the SF-36 questionnaire indicated that for male respondents aged 55-64, the mean score for the 8 dimensions was 74.4. This mean was practically identical to that of the United States norm for such people (74.5) and lower than that for the United Kingdom (77.4). For male respondents aged 65 and older, the mean was 68.3. This was numerically higher but again practically the same as that of the norm for the United States (68.1). For females aged 55-64, the mean score for 8 dimensions was 73. This was superior to that of the United States norm of (70.6) for such people and lower than that for the United Kingdom (74.6).

Comparing 18 average figures for our respondents on satisfaction with specific domains of life (e.g., financial security, health, friendships) and life as a whole with those of average adults in Prince George in November 1999, we found that in all but two cases the older people's scores were higher. Only in the cases of satisfaction with health and overall happiness were older people's scores lower, and the differences were not statistically significant. Eleven percent of our respondents reported that they had been a victim of a crime in the last year, compared to 38% in our 1997 adult victimization survey. Older people had a more benign view than ordinary adults of the growth of crime in their neighbourhood and city, although exactly 64% of both groups thought that crime had increased in Canada. Although older people had a more optimistic view than other adults of the increase in crime in their neighbourhoods, fewer of the former than the latter felt safe out at night. Nevertheless, compared to adults surveyed in 1997, the behaviour of respondents in our survey of older people was not as constrained by concerns of criminal victimization. Two or three of the 8 SF-36 health dimensions explained 37% of the variation in life satisfaction scores, 34% of variation in happiness scores, 34% in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores and 22% in satisfaction with one's overall standard of living.

The main aim of the survey was to measure respondents' assessments of local police services in Prince George, and their relative impact on the quality of respondents' lives. Generally speaking, the evaluations were quite favourable. For example, in response to the question 'what kind of a job do you think the RCMP are doing', 30% said a 'very good job' and 38% said a 'fairly good job', compared to 2% who said they were doing a 'very poor job' and 4% more a 'fairly poor job'. Compared to a 1997 survey, fewer people thought that crime had increased in the past few years, which is actually consistent with official crime statistics. The biggest perceived problem was with speeding and careless driving, although respondents rated traffic and highway enforcement as the least important of a dozen kinds of police activities. People most appreciated police work aimed at preventing crimes. Of the things people did to protect themselves from becoming a victim, keeping items in their cars out of sight headed the list. As in previous surveys in this community, highest levels of satisfaction were expressed for living partners and family relations generally. Estimating the relative impact of three police/crime related variables ( satisfaction with feelings of personal safety around one's home and in one's community, and with local policing services) on the quality of life measured in five different ways in the context of 12 other variables, it was found that only the last variable ( satisfaction with policing services) had a statistically significant association to the quality of life measured in three of the five ways. Forty percent of the variation in happiness scores and 63% of the variation in life satisfaction scores could be explained by five and six predictors, respectively, without any significant association with satisfaction with policing services. Sixty-two percent of the variation in satisfaction with respondents' overall quality of life scores could be explained by eight predictors, with satisfaction with policing services as the third most influential predictor behind satisfaction with respondents' self-esteem and friendships. Sixty-one percent of the variation in satisfaction with respondents' standard of living scores was explained by seven predictors, with satisfaction with policing services being least influential.

A randomly drawn household sample of 315 adult residents of Prince George, British Columbia served as the working data-set. Examining zero-order correlations, among other things, it was found that playing a musical instrument a number of times per year was positively associated with general health (r = 0.37), while singing alone a number of hours per week was negatively associated with general health (r = -0.19). The strongest positive associations with life satisfaction are satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking and embroidery, needlepoint or cross-stitching, at r = 0.39 and r = 0.32, respectively. The satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking (r = 0.35) and buying works of art (r = 0.32) were the most positive influences on happiness. The strongest associations with the Index of Subjective Well-Being are the satisfaction obtained from gourmet cooking (r = 0.37) and the satisfaction obtained from knitting or crocheting (r = 0.34). Examining multivariate relations, it was found that eight predictors combined to explain 59% of the variance in life satisfaction scores, with self-esteem satisfaction (beta = 0.35) and friendship satisfaction (beta = 0.27) most influential. Among the arts-related predictors in the eight, singing alone was fairly influential and negative beta = -0.18), while the satisfaction obtained from reading to others (beta = 0.08) and the Index of Arts as Self-Health Enhancers (beta = 0.11) were somewhat less influential. When the arts-related predictors were combined with a set of domain satisfaction predictors, total explanatory power was increased by only 3 percentage points. Seven predictors could explain 58% of the variance in satisfaction with the overall quality of life scores. Of the arts-related predictors, only time spent going to non-art museums was significant (beta = 0.07). Arts-related predictors did not increase explanatory power at all beyond that obtained from domain satisfaction variables alone. Eight predictors explained 42% of the variance in happiness scores, with the most influential predictors including satisfaction with self-esteem (beta = 0.37) and financial security (beta = 0.21), followed by the Index Arts as Self-Developing Activities (beta = 0.18). Arts-related predictors added 3 percentage points of explanatory power to that obtained from domain satisfaction scores. Seven predictors could explain 65% of the variance in scores on the Index of Subjective Well-Being, led by self-esteem satisfaction (beta = 0.35) and financial security satisfaction (beta = 0.30). The Index of Arts as Community Builders had a modest influence (beta = 0.11), but all together, arts-related predictors increased our total explanatory power by a single percentage point. Summarizing these multivariate results, it seems fair to say that, relative to the satisfaction obtained from other domains of life, the arts had a very small impact on the quality of life (measured in four somewhat different ways) of a sample of residents of Prince George who generally cared about the arts. Even in absolute terms, arts-related activities could only explain from 5% to 11% of the variance in four plausible measures of the self-perceived quality of respondents' lives. By comparing the composition of our sample with census data from 2001, it was demonstrated that the sample was not representative of residents of our city.

Young women involved in sex work are particularly vulnerable. The purpose of this study is to determine HIV-related vulnerabilities associated with sex work amongst young Aboriginal women in two Canadian cities. Methods: This study is based on a community-based cohort of Aboriginal young people (status and non-status First Nations, Inuit and Metis) between the ages of 14 and 30 who used injection or non-injection illegal drugs (street drugs) in the previous month. Participants lived in Vancouver, Canada, or Prince George, a remote, northern Canadian city. Between October 2003 and July 2005, 543 participants were recruited by word of mouth, posters, and street outreach. A baseline questionnaire was administered by Aboriginal interviewers, and trained nurses drew blood samples for HIV and HCV antibodies and provided pre- and post-test counselling. This study included 262 Young women who participated at baseline. Analyses were conducted to compare socio-demographics, drug use patterns, injection practices, sexual experiences, and HIV and HCV prevalence between young women who reported being involved in sex work in the last 6 months (n = 154) versus young women who did not (n = 108). Logistic regression was used to identify factors independently associated with recent sex work involvement. Results: Both sexual violence and drug using patterns were found to be markedly different for women having recently been involved in sex work. Multivariate analysis revealed daily injection of cocaine (AOR = 4.4; 95% CI: 1.9, 10.1 and smoking crack (AOR = 2.9; 95% CI: 1.6, 5.2) in the previous 6 months, and lifetime sexual abuse (AOR = 2.5; 95% CI: 1.4, 4.4) to be independently associated with sex work. Interpretation: Harm reduction and treatment programs that address historical and lifetime trauma amongst Aboriginal people and prioritize emotional and physical safety for young Aboriginal women involved in sex work are required.

Aspects addressed include estimation of the dispersion parameter, estimation of regression coefficients and their standard errors, and the performance of model selection tests. The effects of varying amounts of overdispersion and differing underlying variance structure on this performance were of particular interest. This study is related to work reported by Breslow (1990) although the context is quite different. Preliminary work led to the conclusion that estimation of the dispersion parameter should be based on Pearson's chi-square statistic rather than the Poisson deviance. Regression coefficients are well estimated, even in the presence of substantial overdispersion and when the model for the variance function is incorrectly specified. Despite potential greater variability, the empirical estimator of the covariance matrix is preferred because the model-based estimator is unreliable in general. When the model for the variance function is incorrect, model-based test statistics may perform poorly, in sharp contrast to empirical test statistics, which performed very well in this study.",10.2307/3315402,1994,1994,[],False,,

The genesis of these deposits is related to the emplacement of intermediate to felsic, hypabyssal, generally porphyritic intrusions that are commonly formed at convergent plate margins. Porphyry deposits of the Canadian Cordillera occur in association with two distinctive intrusive suites: calc-alkalic and alkalic. In the Canadian Cordillera, these deposits formed during two separate time periods: Late Triassic to Middle Jurassic (early Mesozoic), and Late Cretaceous to Eocene (Mesozoic-Cenozoic). Deposits of the early Mesozoic period occur in at least three different are terranes (Wrangellia, Stikinia and Quesnellia) with a single deposit occurring in the oceanic assemblage of the Cache Creek terrane. These terranes were located outboard from continental North America during formation of most of their contained early Mesozoic porphyry deposits. Some of the deposits of this early period may have been emplaced during terrane collisions. Metal assemblages in deposits of the calc-alkalic suite include Mo-Cu (Brenda), Cu-Mo (Highland Valley, Gibraltar), Cu-Mo-Au-Ag (Island Copper, Schaft Creek) and Cu-Au (Kemess, Kerr). The alkalic suite deposits are characterized by a Cu-Au assemblage (Copper Mountain, Afton-Ajax, Mt. Milligan, Mount Polley, Galore Creek). Although silver is recovered from calc-alkalic and alkalic porphyry copper mining operations, silver data are seldom included in the published reserve figures. Those available are in the range of 1-2 grams per tonne (g.t(-1)). Alkalic suite deposits are restricted to the early Mesozoic and display distinctive petrology, alteration and mineralization that suggest a similar tectonic setting for both Quesnellia and Stikinia in Early Jurassic time. The younger deposits, late Mesozoic to Cenozoic in age, formed in an intracontinental setting, after the outboard host are and related terranes accreted to the western margin of North America. These deposits are interpreted to occur in continental are settings, and individual deposits are hosted by a variety of older country rocks. These younger deposits also show a spectrum of metal associations: Cu-Mo (Huckleberry, Berg), Cu-Au (-Mo) (Bell, Granisle, Fish Lake, Casino), Mo (Endako, Boss Mountain, Kit-sault, Quartz Hill), Mo-W (Logtung), Au-W (Dublin Gulch) and Au (Ft. Knox). There may be a continuum between Mo, Mo-W, Au-Mo-W and Au deposits.

To make quick and inexpensive preliminary assessments that are reproducible, we propose using a statistical, remote sensing-based approach to estimate the probability of catastrophic drainage of moraine-dammed lakes. We completed a comprehensive inventory of 175 moraine-dammed lakes in the southern Coast Mountains of British Columbia, Canada. By applying logistic regression analysis to the data set, we identified and weighted the following four independent predictor variables that best discriminate drained lakes from undrained lakes: moraine height-to-width ratio, presence/absence of an ice-core in the moraine, lake area, and main rock type forming the moraine. With an appropriate classification cutoff value, the predictive model correctly classifies 70% of drained lakes and 90% of undrained lakes, for an overall accuracy of 88%. Our model provides engineers and geoscientists with a tool for making first-order estimates of the probability of catastrophic drainage from moraine-dammed lakes in southwestern British Columbia.

The article argues that this conflict between Canadian and Witsuwit'en law reflects fundamental tensions between their respective foundations in relations of the commodity and the gift. Within settler capitalist society, the value of a commodity is constructed relationally through a political economy of exchange that aims to speed transactions to maximize profits. With an ongoing drive for time-space compression, there is continual pressure in settler capitalism to develop new infrastructure that can speed the circulation of commodities. In Witsuwit'en society, the gift presents a contrasting logic of place-time extension. Rather than focusing on closing transactions to increase profits, gift giving stretches reciprocal obligations into the past and future. Contrasting these distinct conceptions of the relationship between value and time, the article argues that the Witsuwit'en struggle with Coastal GasLink should be understood as conflict between colonial temporal enclosures and a radical promise to open futures different to those engendered by the colonial present.",10.4337/jhre.2020.03.06,2020,2020,[],False,,

Subsequent to 1964 there was a rapid decline, principally in 1967, and recruitment failure has continued since that time. Flow regulation, which began in 1952 with the completion of Kenney Dam, preceded recruitment failure by 15 years and therefore flow regulation does not supply a simple unicausal explanation for recruitment failure. We propose that sediment input from an upstream channel avulsion in 1961, in combination with elevated flows in 1964 and 1967, led to alterations to riverbed substrates in critical white sturgeon habitat. Using air photos and specific gauge analysis, we identified a ""sediment wave"" in the upper Nechako River.

Stratigraphic correlation of the lake sediments suggests that an extensive lake system occurred in the region during the Olympia Nonglacial Interval. Late Wisconsinan ice initially moved along major valleys, with glaciofluvial outwash deposited in front of the advancing ice. Advance-phase glaciolacustrine sediments are rare but significant, as slope failures are spatially associated with areas where they are preserved. The distribution of these sediments and associated deltaic deposits indicates that advance-phase glacial lakes occurred up to approximately 855 m asl, at least several metres above the modern reservoir level. Sediments deposited in front of the ice margin were overridden during ice advance and are best preserved in large valleys. At the glacial maximum, ice flowed northeasterly throughout the study region. Crag and tails, flutings, and drumlinoid ridges with a generally consistent northeast trend are the dominant landforms.

In recent years, record high river temperatures during spawning migrations of Fraser River sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) have been associated with high mortality events, raising concerns about long-term viability of the numerous natal stocks faced with climate warming. In this study, the effect of freshwater thermal experience on spawning migration survival was estimated by fitting capture-recapture models to telemetry data collected for 1474 adults (captured in either the ocean or river between 2002 and 2007) from four Fraser River sockeye salmon stock-aggregates (Chilko, Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams). Survival of Adams sockeye salmon was the most impacted by warm temperatures encountered in the lower river, followed by that of Stellako-Late Stuart and Quesnel. In contrast, survival of Chilko fish was insensitive to the encountered river temperature. In all stocks, in-river survival of ocean-captured sockeye salmon was higher than that of river-captured fish and, generally, the difference was more pronounced under warm temperatures. The survival-temperature relationships for ocean-captured fish were used to predict historic (1961-1990) and future (2010-2099) survival under simulated lower river thermal experiences for the Quesnel, Stellako-Late Stuart and Adams stocks. A decrease of 9-16% in survival of all these stocks was predicted by the end of the century if the Fraser River continues to warm as expected. However, the decrease in future survival of Adams sockeye salmon would occur only if fish continue to enter the river abnormally early, towards warmer periods of the summer, as they have done since 1995. The survival estimates and predictions presented here are likely optimistic and emphasize the need to consider stock-specific responses to temperature and climate warming into fisheries management and conservation strategies.",10.1111/j.1365-2486.2010.02241.x,2011,2011,[],False,,

A consistent spatial pattern of high-elevation (1600-2400m a.s.l.), ice-marginal meltwater channels is evident across central British Columbia.

Our reconstruction shows a successive westward retreat of the ice margin from the western foot of the Rocky Mountains, accompanied by the formation and rapid evolution of a glacial lake in the upper Fraser River basin. The final stage of deglaciation is characterized by the frontal retreat of ice lobes through the valleys of the Skeena and Omineca Mountains and by the formation of large esker systems in the most prominent topographic lows of the Interior Plateau.

We demonstrate that maximum velocities measured at the highest radar frequency are similar to1.3 times larger than those at the lowest frequency. We also show that for observations inside the instability cone, the velocity magnitude strongly decreases with aspect angle and the rate of the decrease is scale sensitive. The effect can be described by the fluid theory formula if the nominal electron collision frequencies are replaced by anomalous collision frequencies that are similar to5 times larger.

New U/Pb (n = 6) and laser 40Ar/39Ar (n = 10) isotopic age dates reported in this paper suggest there are two distinct ages of plutons: the Topley intrusive suite with isotopic ages between 218 and 193 Ma; and, east of Babine Lake, the new Spike Peak intrusive suite with isotopic ages ranging from 179 to 166 Ma. West of the main plutonic belt is a thick volcanic succession of subaerial, porphyritic andesite flows, volcanic breccias, and rhyolitic ash-flow tuffs that have isotopic ages between 185 and 174 Ma. These rocks are assigned to the Saddle Hill Formation of the Hazelton Group. The plutonic roots of this proximal arc assemblage are most likely the coeval and compositionally similar plutons of the Spike Peak intrusive suite that have been unroofed in the area east of the Takla Fault.

Prescriptions were designed to represent a range of possible harvesting options outlined by the Forest Practices Code of B.C., or associated best management practice guidelines. Five years after the completion of harvesting treatments, temperatures remained four to six degrees warmer, and diurnal temperature variation remained higher than in the control streams regardless of treatment. Initially, the high-retention treatment acted to mitigate the temperature effects of the harvesting, but 3 successive years of windthrow was antecedent to reduced canopy density and equivalent temperature impacts. We speculate that late autumn reversals in the impacts of forest harvesting also occur. Temperature impacts in this study remained within the tolerance limits of local biota.

This model is tested using the current electric vehicle fleet and charging infrastructure of Prince George, British Columbia, as a case study with a hypothetical short notice forest fire scenario.

The objective of this research is to develop an approach for investigating the spatial distribution of forest pattern across a study area where forest harvesting, other anthropogenic activities, and topography, are all influencing forest pattern.

Multivariate cluster analysis (with the CLARA algorithm) is used to group landscape objects containing forest pattern information into SPR. Of the six generated SPR, the second cluster (SPR2) is the most prevalent covering 22% of the study area. On average, landscapes in SPR2 are comprised of 55.5% forest cover, and contain the highest number of patches, and forest/non-forest joins, indicating highly fragmented landscapes. Regionalization of landscape pattern metrics provides a useful approach for examining the spatial distribution of forest pattern.

Sediment core profiles have been interpreted as evidence that inputs to lakes have increased. Some investigators have argued, however, that mercury may be sufficiently mobile in sediments to generate profiles that are misinterpreted as historical records. This argument can be tested where the histories of inputs of mercury are known independently from other kinds of information. We have such cases in Canadian lakes and we have been able to assemble sediment core records for comparison with known source histories. Three cases are represented by Clay Lake in Ontario where the source was a chlor-alkali plant with a known history of mercury discharges, Giauque Lake in the Northwest Territories where mercury was used at a gold mine to extract gold from ore, and Stuart Lake in British Columbia where a mercury mine operated for a known period at Pinchi Lake, the lake immediately upstream from Stuart Lake. In these cases lake sediment cores were dated using lead-210 and cesium-137 and then slices were analysed for mercury. The histories of mercury deposition derived from the cores agreed well with the known histories of inputs.

While it is very important to burn less fossil fuel and to employ alternative energy sources, other carbon-reduction options must also be considered. Given that forests comprise a large portion of the global landbase and that they play a very significant role in the global carbon cycle, it is logical to examine how forest management practices could effect reductions in carbon emissions. Many papers that discuss forest carbon sinks or sources refer only to the short term (<20 years). This paper focuses on the sustainable carbon storage contributions of a forest over the long term. This paper explains that long-term carbon storage and reduced carbon fluctuation can be achieved by a combination of improved forest management and efficient transfer of carbon into wood products. Here we show how three different forest management scenarios affect the overall carbon storage capacity of forest and wood products combined over the long term. We used a timber supply model and scenario analysis to predict forest carbon and other resource conditions over time in the Prince George Forest District, a 3.4-million-ha landbase in northern British Columbia. We found that the high-harvest scenario stores 3% more carbon than the low-harvest scenario and 27% (120 million tonnes) more carbon than the no-harvest scenario even though only 1.2-million ha is in timber harvesting landbase. Our results tell us that forest management practices that maintain and increase forest area, reduce natural disturbances in the forest, improve forest conditions, and ensure the appropriate and timely transfer of carbon into wood products lead to increasing overall carbon storage, thereby reducing carbon in the atmosphere.

Pollen data from a rare new interglacial site suggest a colder than present Middle Wisconsinan climate. Ice flow during the last glaciation was dominantly southeasterly, but in the Babine Range a regional, westerly ice-flow event occurred. Evidence for westerly flow diminishes eastward of Babine Lake, suggesting that the valley was near the eastward limit of an interior ice divide. Deglacial sediments include ice-marginal debris-flow, glaciofluvial, and glaciolacustrine sediments. Raised-delta elevations indicate that Glacial Lake Babine extended nearly 150 m above present lake level to 850 m asl, and higher, earlier phases may have existed locally.

Eocene pre- and postmineral plagioclase-rich dykes (51.9 +/- 1.8 to 51.3 +/- 1.8 Ma) and late diabase dykes (50.4 +/- 1.8 Ma; all by K-Ar on whole rock) may be correlative with trachyandesite volcanics of the Goosly Lake Formation, part of the Eocene Endako Group. These volcanics have been dated elsewhere at 55.6 +/- 2.5 to 48.8 +/- 1.8 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock and biotite, respectively. Mineralization at Silver Queen is therefore similar in age to, but slightly younger than, the producing Equity mine located 30 km to the northeast, which is estimated at 58.5 +/- 2.0 Ma by K-Ar on whole rock.",10.1139/e92-073,1992,1992,[],False,,

Thus far, little is known about how these partnerships have factored into indigenous pursuits of territorial autonomy. This article describes how the Cheslatta T'en, a Dakelh (Carrier) community in north-central British Columbia, established a measure of control over their homeland after forming an alliance with local nonnative residents. Cheslatta leaders used cultural exchanges and social networks generated by the alliance to fashion territorial initiatives that, when taken together, channel popular environmentalism, provincial forestry policies, and ancestral ethnoecology into collective identity, action, and authority. As a result, the band has attained political influence over its traditional lands without participating in the province's treaty settlement process. Interethnic partnerships in rural areas are particularly relevant to political ecology because they reveal how the common experience of powerlessness can generate new forms of resource management that synthesize diverse constructions of nature. In this way, the paper contributes to the growing empirical work on such alliances and to emerging frameworks for a political ecology of social movements. It also adds to the ethnographic literature on the colonial encounter in British Columbia by highlighting the role of interethnic collaboration in contemporary rural resource management projects.",10.17730/humo.62.1.63afcv8lk0dh97cy,2003,2003,[],False,,

Slide Mountain Terrane is made up of dolerites, pillow basalts associated with cumulate gabbros and peridotites ranging in age from Carboniferous to Permian. Cache Creek Terrane consists of tectonic slices of Paleozoic platform carbonates, undated cumulate gabbros intruded by dolerites, foliated ultramafic rocks and mafic volcanic rocks interbedded within Upper Triassic siliceous and volcaniclastic sediments. Among the Permian (Slide Mountain) and Upper Triassic (Cache Creek) volcanic rocks, four types have been distinguished. Type 1 is geochemically similar to N-MORB. Type 2 is mildly to highly enriched in LREE, Ti, Zr, Hf, Nb, Ta and Th, and differs from Type 1 by lower epsilonNd and higher Pb isotopic ratios. It displays alkaline affinities. Types 3 and 4 occur only in the Cache Creek Terrane. Type 3 has flat REE patterns similar to oceanic plateau basalts and isotope compositions intermediate between Types 1 and 2. Type 4 is distinguished from Type 3 by convex REE patterns and higher Pb isotopic ratios. Cumulate peridotites and gabbros are LREE-depleted and their high epsilonNd suggest that they derived from the melting of a depleted MORB-type mantle source. The foliated ultramafic rocks are either serpentinized harzburgites (Trembleur ultramafics) or dunites, harburgites and minor lherzolites (Murray Ridge), which are, intruded by undeformed pyroxenite veins. The ultramafic rocks have very low contents of rare earth elements (REE) and incompatible elements, and U-shaped REE patterns. The pyroxene-bearing peridotites are distinguished from the Trembleur harzburgites by an absence of Nb negative anomalies and lower (Sr-87/Sr-86)(i) ratios. Slide Mountain and Cache Creek Terranes formed in different tectonic settings. Slide Mountain basin, fringing the North American margin, was probably floored by oceanic crust locally thickened by oceanic island magmas. Indeed, in the Slide Mountain Terrane, N-MORB type basalts predominate and are associated with minor alkaline volcanic rocks within the same thrust sheet. Correlations between incompatible elements and values of the epsilonNd of the Slide Mountain rocks suggest that the N-MORB-type basalts and alkaline rocks are genetically linked. N-MORB type basalts and alkaline volcanic rocks could derive from the mixing of depleted MORB-type and enriched Oceanic island Basalt-type mantle sources. The Cache Creek Terrane may represent remnants of a Late Triassic oceanic plateau because plume-related volcanic rocks predominate while N-MORB type rocks are represented solely by cumulate gabbros and sheeted dykes. The Murray Ridge peridotites could represent the roots of the oceanic plateau. We conclude that the Slide Mountain and Cache Creek Terranes contributed to the growth of the North American continent as when they were accreted to the craton during the Early Triassic and Jurassic times.

Due to preferential logging of lodgepole pine, the availability of subalpine fir in British Columbia is projected to increase significantly, in some regions to as high as 30 percent of the softwood harvest. Logs for the vencer products studied came from five subalpine fir trees (one dominant, one codominant, and three intermediate) from a Canadian Forest Products Ltd.

Participants cycled for a median of 65 (interquartile range: 39-76) minutes per session, with frequent variability noted between participants and different hemodialysis sessions for the same participant. Nine patients completed the European Quality of Life Health Questionnaire prestudy, with 5 (56%) also completing it poststudy. Interviews with 9 patients, 4 nurses, and 1 physiotherapist led to the identification of themes instrumental to implementation: a supportive community dialysis unit, shared responsibility, knowledge of patients/providers, and benefits associated with engagement. Themes that were identified as being key to acceptability in this remote dialysis unit were trust, connection, and engagement through common values. Limitations: Due to dialysis unit size, we had a small number of participants. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility of implementing best practice in a remote community and provides insight into the elements of context and participation that contribute to acceptability in the implementation of intradialytic cycling.",10.1177/20543581211056233,2021,2021,[],False,,

The aim of this paper was (1) to further test the assessment framework by evaluating its applicability for smaller municipalities, (2) to evaluate and categorize local progress in three small cities, namely Campbell River, Prince George and Revelstoke, and (3) to contrast these climate actions with actions taken by larger municipalities in BC, using the same assessment framework. This assessment revealed that key external support made available to expand on their Integrated Community Sustainability Plans provided for striking similarities among the three case studies regarding their strategies and plan formulations for which actions were largely transformative or reformative. However, the three small cities were lacking periodic reporting and monitoring of actions and presented shorter timeframes of up to 20-50 years for their planning horizons, all of which negatively impact their prioritization strategies. The main difference between larger and smaller cities was found among actions related to the feedback and evaluation category of the framework, with smaller cities performing more poorly. Greater shift in priorities away from climate change-related actions were evident in smaller local governments, signalling their more vulnerable position regarding changes in leadership in local and provincial administrations. This study highlights the key role that strategic alliances, networks, and external champions as partners play in planning and implementing climate action and in increasing public interest in sustainability. Thus, these should be fostered and promoted to keep building local capacity and effectively accelerate greater change through e.g., strengthening their capacity to implement, monitor and evaluate climate actions.",10.1016/j.crsust.2020.100010,2020,2020,[],False,,

Growing evidence suggests that using mobile phones for health (mHealth) may be a powerful way to support connection with health services, including HIV prevention and treatment. Objective: This study examined the patterns of mobile phone ownership and use among young Indigenous people who have used drugs living with or vulnerable to HIV and explored the acceptability of mHealth to support access to health care in this population. Methods: The Cedar Project is a cohort study involving young Indigenous people who have used drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. This mixed methods exploratory study involved 131 Cedar Project participants enrolled in our WelTel mHealth program. At enrollment, participants completed a questionnaire related to mobile phone use and interest in mHealth. Data were linked to Cedar Project questionnaires and serodata. We present comparative statistics (quantitative) and results of a rapid thematic analysis (qualitative) related to mobile phone patterns and interest in receiving mHealth. Results: Less than half of the participants (59/130; 45.4%) reported owning a phone. Among those with a phone, the majority owned a smartphone (46/59; 78%). Most participants with a phone reported having an unlimited texting plan (39/55; 71%), using the internet on their phone (44/59; 75%), and texting daily (44/55; 80%).

We report mortality rates among young Indigenous people who use drugs in British Columbia and explore predictors of mortality over time. METHODS: We analyzed data collected every 6 months between 2003 and 2014 by the Cedar Project, a prospective cohort study involving young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios using Indigenous and Canadian reference populations. We identified predictors of mortality using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression. RESULTS: Among 610 participants, 40 died between 2003 and 2014, yielding a mortality rate of 670 per 100 000 person-years. Young Indigenous people who used drugs were 12.9 (95% confidence interval [CI] 9.2-17.5) times more likely to die than all Canadians the same age and were 7.8 (95% CI 5.6-10.6) times more likely to die than Indigenous people with Status in BC. Young women and those using drugs by injection were most affected. The leading causes of death were overdose (n = 15 [38%]), illness (n = 11 [28%]) and suicide (n = 5 [12%]). Predictors of mortality included having hepatitis C at baseline (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 2.76, 95% CI 1.47-5.16), previous attempted suicide (adjusted HR 1.88, 95% CI 1.01-3.50) and recent overdose (adjusted HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.00-8.09).

Programs that support healing from lifetime trauma, support connection to culture, and reduce drug-related harms are critical to preventing HIV among young Indigenous people who use drugs. The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth intervention proposed here is a structured mobile-phone initiative to connect young Indigenous people who use drugs with Cedar Case Managers in a community-based setting. The intervention consists of a package of supports, including a mobile phone and cellular plan, weekly two-way text messaging, and support from Cedar Case Managers. Methods: The Cedar Project WelTel mHealth study is a multi-site Zelen pre-randomized trial to measure the effect of a two-way supportive text-message intervention to reduce HIV vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use illicit drugs in two Canadian cities. The trial is nested within the Cedar Project, an ongoing cohort study addressing HIV and hepatitis C vulnerability among young Indigenous people who use drugs in Vancouver and Prince George, British Columbia. The Cedar Project Partnership, an independent body of Indigenous Elders, leaders, and health/social service experts, governs all aspects of the study. Two hundred participants will be followed over a 16-month period, with HIV propensity score at 6 months as the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes include HIV propensity at 1 year, HIV risk, resilience, psychological distress, access to drug-related services, and connection to culture measured at 6 months and 1 year. Primary analysis is by intention to treat. Discussion: Culturally safe interventions that address barriers to HIV prevention while supporting the strength of young Indigenous people who use drugs are urgently needed. Despite presenting a tremendous opportunity to connect young, highly transient Indigenous people who use drugs to prevention services, supportive two-way mHealth programs have yet to be tested for HIV prevention in a community-based setting with this population.",10.1186/s13063-016-1250-3,2016,2016,[],False,,

Until recently, the logs and tree stems pulled from the bottom of lakes, reservoirs and waterways were assumed good only for pulp. The Nechako reservoir timber does not have enough fibre strength for the Council of Forest Industries to approve it for use as stress-grade lumber. But Nichols and IML have found a way to circumvent the problem. They extracted a sample of logs from the bottom of Nechako reservoir and shipped them to Oregon for testing.

This study focuses on climate change impacts on the snow hydrology of the Fraser River basin (FRB) of British Columbia (BC), Canada, using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model (VIC). Statistically downscaled forcing datasets based on 12 models from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are used to drive VIC for two 30-yr time periods, a historical baseline (1980-2009) and future projections (2040-69: 2050s), under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. The ensemble-based VIC simulations reveal widespread and regionally coherent spatial changes in snowfall, snow water equivalent (SWE), and snow cover over the FRB by the 2050s. While the mean precipitation is projected to increase slightly, the fraction of precipitation falling as snow is projected to decrease by nearly 50% in the 2050s compared to the baseline. Snow accumulation and snow-covered area are projected to decline substantially across the FRB, particularly in the Rocky Mountains. Onset of springtime snowmelt in the 2050s is projected to be nearly 25 days earlier than historically, yielding more runoff in the winter and spring for the Fraser River at Hope, BC, and earlier recession to low-flow volumes in summer. The ratio of snowmelt contribution to runoff decreases by nearly 20% in the Stuart and Nautley subbasins of the FRB in the 2050s. The decrease in SWE and loss of snow cover is greater from low to midelevations than in high elevations, where temperatures remain sufficiently cold for precipitation to fall as snow.",10.1175/JHM-D-16-0012.1,2017,2017,[],False,,

It comprises the Pimainus Formation (mafic to felsic lava, volcaniclastic and interbedded epiclastic rocks) and the overlying Spius Formation (andesitic lava flows). Including previous work, we have 55 sites distributed among 15 localities representing most of the > 3000 m thickness. Forty-seven sites (286 oriented cores, 457 specimens), mainly andesites, yielded acceptable data. The beds are gently to moderately tilted, partly due to synvolcanic deformation. Samples taken from a sequence of flows at any one locality have, with one exception, well-grouped magnetization directions. Polarities are all normal, as expected for rocks laid down in the Cretaceous Normal Superchron. Declinations always are clockwise of that expected of cratonic North America, indicating 60 degrees rotation of the Spences Bridge Group as a whole. However, declinations differ from locality to locality, implying relative interlocality rotations about vertical axes. Hence inclination-only analysis has been used to estimate dispersion, mean inclination, and paleolatitude. Minimum dispersion for the Spius Formation (27 sites) was achieved after 80% untilting, but the changes between 80 and 100% untilting are insignificant, indicating that magnetization was acquired predominantly before tilting. By contrast, minimum dispersion for the Pimainus Formation (20 sites) was achieved after 50% untilting, indicating that magnetization was acquired after synvolcanic tilting when buried beneath the overlying Spius Formation. Polished thin section studies show that magnetite in the Pimainus Formation has undergone extensive low temperature hydrothermal alteration, whereas magnetite in the Spius Formation shows little alteration. Throughout the range of tilt correction, from 0% to 100%, the mean inclinations of both formations were less than expected from observations obtained from mid-Cretaceous rocks of cratonic North America. The best estimate of paleolatitude (from the Spius Formation) is 50.8 degrees +/- 5.0 degrees (P=0.05), which is 9.5 degrees +/- 5.7 degrees less than would be expected had the rocks had been rigidly attached to North America. This corresponds to displacement from the south of 1100 +/- 600 km. Displacement between the northern Intermontane Belt and craton probably was accommodated along major strike-slip faults (Northern Rocky Mountain Trench, Finlay, Pinchi etc.). In the south, our results require a major dextral fault (the Intra-Quesnellia fault) to be situated during Late Cretaceous or Paleocene time within or marginal to the Omineca Belt, along which about 1000 km of dextral motion occurred. This could be a southern extension of the Pinchi Fault whose trace is now obscured by Eocene extension and tectonic denudation. The results also indicate that the largest tectonic discontinuity in the Canadian Cordillera occurs not to the east of the Intermontane Belt, as commonly assumed, but to the west, because the displacements relative to cratonic North America observed from the Intermontane Belt are only about one third of those observed from the-Coast Belt.",10.1029/94JB03012,1995,1995,[],False,,

The TLVC showed that most of the thermocline deflections at the dam could be accounted for by considering the first two basins upstream of the dam, Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and that the thermocline deflections were dominated by the first (H1) and second (H2) horizontal baroclinic modes of the combined basins. Calibration of the TLVC against the field data showed that the H1 and H2 modes were strongly damped, with effectively no free thermocline oscillations. This strong damping had two effects: high coherence between the wind and thermocline deflections and phase lags between thermocline deflections at different locations. The damping in Nechako Reservoir is stronger than in many lakes, and results from both high velocities within the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes and drag due to submerged trees, which cover 30% of the bed.

Similar to lakes of simpler geometry, the first-vertical first-horizontal mode (V1H1) of Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes was found to be the most energetic mode. This V1H1 dominance is attributed to similarity between the relatively uniform distributions of along-thalweg wind and surface-layer flow for the V1H1 mode. Two bathymetric features, the geometric constriction between Knewstubb and Natalkuz Lakes, and changes in thalweg orientation relative to the wind field act to create subbasins in which wind forcing causes local metalimnetic tilts. These subbasin scale tilts deepen the metalimnion at the downwind ends of the subbasins, raise the metalimnion at the upwind ends, and are superimposed on the lake-wide V1H1 tilt. The metalimnetic tilts in the subbasins are attributed to higher horizontal modes that are equivalent to V1H1 modes of the subbasins. Because the thickness of the metalimnion is significant, the subbasin metalimnetic tilts occur with variations in the metalimnetic thickness along the subbasins; the metalimnion is compressed at the downwind end and expanded at the other end of each subbasin. This variability in thickness leads to metalimnetic intrusions following the relaxation of wind forcing. The findings of this study contribute to characterizing the baroclinic response to wind in lakes of complex bathymetry. In particular, this study helps in understanding the effect of bathymetric features on modal composition of the baroclinic response.",10.1002/lno.11328,2020,2020,[],False,,

However, it has been a difficult basin to explore because of the presence of Tertiary volcanic outcrop. The volcanic outcrop makes the use of conventional seismic exploration methods difficult owing to a strong velocity inversion at its base. An alternative is the passive source method known as ambient noise surface wave tomography. The method, which examines the high-frequency surface wave field that is obtained from noise analysis, is sensitive to large-scale crustal structure and has been successfully applied to measuring the depths of sedimentary basins. Station-to-station Green's functions within the basin were estimated by cross-correlating the vertical components of the seismic noise data recorded by 12 POLARIS (Portable Observatories for Lithosphere Analysis and Research Investigating Seismicity) and CNSN (Canadian National Seismgraph Network) seismic stations between September 2006 and November 2007. The resulting Green's functions were dominated by Rayleigh waves. The dispersion characteristics of the Rayleigh waveforms were measured within the microseismic band. Inversion of the dispersion curves produced 1-D and 2-D thickness models and 2-D group velocity models for the Nechako Basin and its surrounding region. The velocity models indicate two low group velocity structures within the basin that might represent sedimentary packages, and some pockets of high-velocity zones that show the presence of volcanic rocks within and on the basin.

Intervention Participants were randomized into 2 groups, a tampon group and a menstrual cup group. Using online diaries, participants tracked 1 menstrual cycle using their regular method and 3 menstrual cycles using the method of their allocated group. Main outcome measures Overall satisfaction; secondary outcomes included discomfort, urovaginal infection, cost, and waste. Results Forty-seven women in each group completed the final survey, 5 of whom were subsequently excluded from analysis (3 from the tampon group and 2 from the menstrual cup group). Overall satisfaction on a 7-point Likert scale was higher for the menstrual cup group than for the tampon group (mean [standard deviation] score 5.4 [1.5] vs 5.0 [1.0], respectively; P = .04).

For the Ecstall pluton of British Columbia, the inclination of magnetic remanence directions steepens to the east from 16degrees to 81degrees [Butler et al., J. Geophys. Res. 107 (2002)] between 24 and 12 kin west of a thermal boundary with the Coast Mountains batholith (CMB). The CMB was at 700-800degreesC between 60 and 52 Ma. The. stable remanent magnetization is in ilmenohematite grains with exsolved lamellae of ferrian ilmenite. It has the characteristic properties of lamellar magnetism [Robinson et al., Nature 418 (2002) 517-520] which is acquired with exsolution in ilmenohematite below 390degreesC [Ghiorso, Phys. Chem. Minerals 25 (1997) 28-38]; thus, it is thermal chemical remanent magnetization (TCRM). Our heat flow calculations show that the thermal effects of Eocene CMB on the adjacent 91 Ma Ecstall pluton were enough to reset the remanent magnetization directions. Reheating to the temperatures necessary for TCRM is supported by K/Ar and Ar/Ar cooling dates on hornblende and biotite, which young from west to east towards the CMB in concert with the change in inclinations. Thus, the progressive steepening of magnetization inclinations is attributed to reheating during the Eocene of the 91 Ma Ecstall pluton by the CMB. This reheating followed post-solidification northward latitudinal displacement of the pluton. The amount of translational displacement of the coastal terranes of British Columbia prior to 60 Ma hinges on the interpretation of discordant magnetizations from plutons that may have cooled slowly after emplacement in the mid to lower crust, as was the case for the Ecstall pluton. Many of these plutons contain ilmenohematite as an accessory magnetic phase. Our interpretation for the low temperature acquisition of TCRM in the Ecstall pluton may have far-reaching implications for understanding enigmatic discordant paleomagnetic directions reported from plutons of the western Canadian Cordillera.

Multiple sediment proxies of lake production, as well as nitrogen and carbon stable isotopes, all portray relatively complacent stratigraphies, despite well-monitored changes in salmon returns over the most recent 60 years. The separation of autochthonous from total sediment organic matter did not clarify the identification of the nitrogen isotopic fingerprint of marine-derived nutrients (MDN). Slight shifts in diatom assemblages are better interpreted as responses to either early human activities in the catchment or post-Little Ice Age climate warming. The low proportion of MDN in the lake's annual budget (3% N and 7% P) is the probable reason their influence is not expressed in lake sediments. Thus, paleolimnology is incapable of providing unequivocal inferences concerning historical salmon abundances in Fraser Lake, in contrast to lakes from southern Alaska, where the same techniques have yielded unambiguous results. Sediment MDN proxies, together with catchment characteristics and escapement data, were collated for an additional nine sockeye nursery lakes spanning southern Alaska to southern BC. Primary production and biogeochemical cycling in Alaskan nursery lakes appears largely driven by MDN from sockeye returns, whereas BC lakes are more strongly influenced by allochthonous organic matter and lake-water residence times. Alaskan lakes possess the limnological features that are prerequisite for meaningful salmon reconstructions using paleolimnology, while lakes from southern BC do not. This does not suggest that MDN are unimportant in southern BC lakes but rather that they are not readily disentangled from other factors that shape the paleolimnological record.",10.4319/lo.2007.52.5.2053,2007,2007,[],False,,

Our objective was to assess medical student experience and comfort with common urologic clinical encounters and to determine whether any differences exist between the distributed education sites at the University of British Columbia (UBC). Methods: Questionnaires assessing urologic education were delivered simultaneously to all final-year UBC medical students attending campuses in Vancouver, Victoria and Prince George. Results were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: Overall, 55.8% of students felt their exposure to urology was adequate in the medical curriculum; learners in the Northern Program (Prince George) ranked their clinical and didactic experiences significantly higher.

Using a laboratory swim flume and volitionally swimming adult fish carrying EMG transmitters, we developed relationships between EMG pulse intervals and swim speeds. A bioenergetics model was used to estimate reach-specific energy use per metre for each individual based on the average swim speed, migration time, body size, and river temperature. Migration was most energetically efficient (i.e., migration costs per unit distance traveled were relatively low) for females compared with males, large males compared with small males, and 1995 males compared with 1993 males. In all three cases, differences in swim speed patterns were primarily responsible for differences in energy use. For both sexes and in both years, migrations through reaches that contained a constriction (caused by an island, gravel bar, or large rock outcropping) were energetically inefficient compared with that through reaches with no constrictions. The high energetic costs at constrictions seem to result from long travel times probably caused by turbulent flow patterns that may generate confusing migrational cues.",10.1139/cjfas-55-8-1821,1998,1998,[],False,,

Rivers are partitioned into eastward and westward flowing rivers based on flow direction from the Coast Mountains. Thus, eastward and westward runoff trends and influence of topography on runoff are explored. Our findings indicate that rivers flowing eastward to the Nechako and Chilcotin plateaus contribute the lowest annual runoff compared to westward rivers where runoff is high. Low interannual runoff variability is evident in westward rivers and their alpine watersheds, whereas eastward rivers exhibit high interannual runoff variability. On Vancouver Island, some of the rivers with the highest annual runoff exhibit high interannual variability. A significant (p < .05) negative correlation exists between mean annual runoff (R-m) and latitude, gauged area, mean elevation, and its corresponding coefficient of variation. However, a significant positive correlation was found between the glacierized area of mountainous regions and Rm. The mean coefficient of variation in annual runoff is significantly negatively correlated with latitude and glacierized area, but significantly positively correlated with longitude. Annual and seasonal runoff trend analyses of each river were performed for an early (1936-2015), a middle (1966-2015), and a late (1986-2015) period using the Mann-Kendall test. Trend analyses revealed a shift towards more positive detectable (signal-to-noise ratio > 1) trends in annual and seasonal runoff from the middle to the late period across the study domain. Most positive detectable seasonal runoff trends in the middle period occur in spring in glacierized westward rivers located > 1,200 m, whereas in the late period, they all occur in fall and are regionally coherent around Vancouver Island and south coastal BC. Rivers draining eastward exhibit more positive trends over 1986-2015 compared to westward rivers.

Interpretation reveals that dextral transtension in the Early to Middle Eocene created NNW-trending, en echelon, strike-slip faults linked by pull-apart basins, which locally contain a thickness of Eocene volcaniclastic rocks of >3 km. This structural pattern is consistent with regional observations that suggest the transfer of slip from the Yalakom fault to the north via a series of en echelon strike-slip faults. In the Middle to Late Eocene, faults associated with a change in the direction of stress, echoed by the north-trending right-lateral Fraser fault, reactivated and cut earlier structures. A simple model agrees with local observations, that northeast-directed compression was subparallel to the relic Cretaceous grain. Cretaceous rocks are discontinuous throughout the basin and may be remnants of a broader basin, or a number of contemporaneous basins, formed in a regional transpressional tectonic setting that caused northeast-directed thrusting along the eastern side of the Coast Plutonic Complex. Results suggest that thrusting affected most of the SE Nechako Basin, as observed across the Intermontane Belt to the northwest and southeast.

Before the freshwater portion of the migration, sockeye salmon (Quesnel, Chilcotin, and Nechako stock complexes) were captured in Johnstone Strait (similar to 215 km from river entry), gastrically implanted with radio transmitters, and sampled for blood, gill tissue, and energetic status before release. Analyses focused solely on individuals that successfully reached natal subwatersheds. Migration speeds were assessed by an extensive radiotelemetry array. Individuals from the stock complex that migrated the longest distance (Nechako) traveled at speeds slower than those of other stock complexes. Females traveled slower than males. An elevated energetic status of fish in the ocean was negatively correlated with migration speed in most river segments. During the transition from the ocean to the river, migration speed was negatively correlated with mean maximum water temperature; however, for the majority of river segments, it was positively correlated with migration speed. Physiological status measured in the ocean did not explain among-individual variability in river migration speeds.

Interpretive analysis was grounded in the themes identified in the data. Results: Fatigue was perceived to have cognitive, emotional and physical dimensions and to exert a profound effect on the lives of many people with SCI, such that pleasurable activities were often eschewed to enable the accomplishment of more mundane tasks. Factors most consistently associated with fatigue were pain, depression and hopelessness, side effects of medications, poor quality sleep, spasticity, poor posture, diet, and the effort required to accomplish routine and self-care tasks. Conclusions: Fatigue is a complex phenomenon, interlinked with pain, depression and hopelessness that significantly diminishes the quality of life following SCI.

In Canada, Mountain Beavers are limited to extreme southwestern British Columbia because the Fraser River is an effective barrier to northward dispersal along the Coast Mountains, and because climates become too dry to support Mountain Beavers east and north of the Cascade Mountains. Typical habitat on the east side of the Cascade Mountains consists of sites with damp soils, often near streams, at elevations between 1200 and 1800 m. Principal summer food species found in haypiles within forests were Sitka Valerian (Valeriana sitchensis), Horsetail (Equisetum spp.), Twisted Stalk (Streptopus spp.), Thimbleberry (Rubus parviflorus), and Cow-parsnip (Heracleum lanatum). Narrow-leaved Fireweed (Epilobium angustifolium) was the most common food in haypiles in clearcuts. Densities of underground nest sites in small (< 2.5 ha) areas of high quality habitat reached up to 5.8 nests/ha.

However, tree diameter did not directly predict absolute lipid content, and relative lipid content decreased with tree diameter in males. Larger beetles emerged earlier in the emergence period with relative lipid content remaining constant throughout emergence. All relationships had considerable unexplained variation.

The dominant annual sediment transporting event in the channels is the snowmelt flood events, with lesser activity usually accomplished during summer floods. Annually in August, the channel bed material is reworked by the Early Stuart sockeye salmon spawning, as the fish excavate the streambed to deposit and bury their eggs. These nesting cavities are called redds. Results from 67 tracer recovery experiments over five years were highly variable, subject to the magnitude of floods and the returning population of salmon. Overall, the depositional pattern from nival flood events usually demonstrated a high degree of clast mobilization, long travel distances (up to 150 m), and mean depths of burial up to 18 cm. Summer flood events showed somewhat lower rates of mobilization, distances of travel, and depths of burial. Although the fish did not move the tracers very far, their effect on the bed was generally quite pervasive - up to 100 percent of the clasts were mobilized, and the depth of burial was considerable (mean burial depths up to 14 cm). The amount of vertical mixing of sediment by salmon was often on the same order of magnitude as flood events. The significant vertical mixing of sediments by the fish has important implications for the mobility of sediment in the stream. Since any armoring layer formed during high flows throughout the year is subject to the bioturbation of salmon, this suggests that the transport threshold in the creeks remains relatively low.

The Nechako Watershed, located mainly in the sub-boreal spruce biogeoclimatic zone, spans 47,200 km(2) in area [1]. The regional climate experiences a prominent seasonal cycle in air temperature and precipitation, with subfreezing temperatures and snow accumulating during winter. Waterways therefore experience extended near 0 degrees C water/ice temperatures during the winter season. The accumulation of snow yields snowmelt-generated peaks in discharge during the spring freshet period in unregulated tributaries [2]. Regional studies on climate reveal recent warming trends that are anticipated to persist through the 21st century, with a projected mean air temperature increase of similar to 2 degrees C by the 2050's [3]. In response to warming air temperatures, regional water temperatures are also on the rise, with an average warming trend of 0.7 degrees C from 1950 to 2015 [4]. Changing water temperatures are important in understanding ecological and environmental impacts on riverine systems, including aquatic species such as fish (e.g., sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), all endemic species to the Nechako Watershed), invertebrates, and microorganisms. Managing water temperatures during the fish spawning season is crucial as elevated temperatures induce stress and affect reproduction success [5]. Starting with a pilot project in summer of 2019, we expanded in situ monitoring of water temperature to 29 sites; however, for the purposes of this paper, only data from 24 sites are included (some sites have limited data samples or loggers could not be retrieved in the field). Currently, 25 sites are fully operational and collecting data, all deployed to sample and record data at 15-minute intervals starting at the top of the hour. Site data collection occurs at minimum once annually (typically during summer/early fall), along with site and logger maintenance. Field notes are taken to identify any potential issues with data collection, such as loggers dewatering during low flows, duration of logger removal for data collection, and any other environmental concerns that should later be considered during data analysis. The assembled data are useful to build long-term time series of observed water temperatures within the Nechako Watershed and as a baseline for future projects. The data are also used to determine the effectiveness of the Summer Temperature Management Program at the Nechako Reservoir and Skins Lake Spillway [1]. Therefore, these data can be used in the future to better identify the optimal discharge from the reservoir to minimize ecological effects on the watershed. (C) 2022 The Author(s).

Colonial legal regimes situate indigeneity as a condition of temporal stasis, perpetuating the logic of territorial dispossession and erasure. Drawing on research in India and Canada, we focus on Indigenous experiences to theorize the relationship between colonial legal regimes, territory, temporality, and infrastructure. In the Indigenous territories of the Lepchas in the Indian Himalaya and the Dakelh in British Columbia, Canada, hydropower infrastructure effected displacements of Indigenous space-times and sovereignty. Although Indigenous peoples continue to assert legal claims challenging these massive infrastructural projects, colonial legal regimes normalize the often violent imposition of the space-times of state and capitalist development. The Dakelh have challenged the enduring impacts of a 1950s river diversion project; however, Canadian courts legitimized historic displacements, delimiting constitutional protections to current existing Dakelh rights. For the Lepchas, a recent infrastructural boom in the Indian Himalaya is threatening special constitutional provisions upholding tribal customary laws, raising concern among younger Lepchas over the future of their ancestral lands. Despite these threats, we demonstrate how Lepcha and Dakelh relations to time and territory exceed colonial containments. They call into question how the colonial present normalizes historic and ongoing displacements and demand responsibility for the past to craft alternative futures.",10.1080/24694452.2021.1978837,2022,2022,[],False,,

This study determined the contemporary and historical sources of fine-grained (< 63-mu m) sediment in a large, regulated river basin and linked changes in sources to activities in the basin. The river has seen declines in chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, and the endangered Nechako white sturgeon populations, and sediment (both fine-grained and sands) transport and deposition have been identified as potential causes of these declines. Materials and methods Samples of suspended sediment and potential source materials were collected from numerous sites distributed throughout the upper Nechako River Basin in British Columbia, Canada. A floodplain sediment core was also collected in order to reconstruct sediment sources over the last similar to 70 years. Discriminating fingerprint properties were used within the MixSIAR model to apportion sources among sub-basins and land-use types. Results were compared to records of precipitation and Nechako River discharge trends, and to changes in landscape development. Results and discussion Contributions from the erosion of channel banks dominated the suspended sediment load at most sites. Changes in sediment sources during the 2015 field season reflected snowmelt and patterns of water release from the Nechako Reservoir that affected the sediment-carrying capacity of tributaries and the Nechako River main stem. Spatial variations in 2015 also reflected the distribution of land use (e.g., forested or agricultural land) as well as topography (e.g., slope steepness). Over the last similar to 70 years, variations in sediment sources and the characteristics of the sediment (e.g., organic matter content and particle size composition) were linked to the construction of the Kenney Dam (operational in 1954) and the impacts of deforestation by the forestry and agricultural industries. Superimposed on these have been wildfires and a major mountain pine beetle infestation leading to higher erosion rates in the affected areas. Conclusions The sediment source fingerprinting technique, in combination with historical information on the hydrometeorology and the land use and river management in the basin, has provided valuable information with which to understand sediment dynamics in the Nechako River Basin. Such an approach can help to disentangle how large river systems respond to a combination of natural and anthropogenic pressures.",10.1007/s11368-019-02299-2,2019,2019,[],False,,

This paper aims to enhance our understanding of the role of connectedness to nature in promoting individual-level climate action in a unique setting where climate research and action are lacking: Canada's Provincial North. To begin to understand possible pathways, we also examined whether climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and climate action. We used data collected via postal surveys in two Provincial North communities, Thunder Bay (Ontario), and Prince George (British Columbia) (n = 628). Results show that connectedness to nature has a direct positive association with individual-level climate action, controlling for gender and education. Results of parallel mediation analyses further show that connectedness to nature is indirectly associated with individual-level climate action, mediated by both climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends. Finally, results suggest that climate worry and talking about climate change with family and friends serially mediate the relationship between connectedness to nature and with individual-level climate action. These findings are relevant for climate change engagement and action, especially across Canada's Provincial North, but also in similar settings characterized by marginalization, heightened vulnerability to climate change, urban islands within vast rural and remote landscapes, and economies and social identities tied to resource extraction. Drawing on these findings, we argue that cultivating stronger connections with nature in the places where people live, learn, work, and play is an important and currently underutilized leverage point for promoting individual-level climate action. This study therefore adds to the current and increasingly relevant calls for (re-)connecting with nature that have been made by others across a range of disciplinary and sectoral divides.",10.3390/cli9100146,2021,2021,[],False,,

The study presented in this thesis attempts to provide insight into this topic. Working under the umbrella of a collaborative research effort between Tl'azt'en Nation and the University of Northern British Columbia, I administered a questionnaire containing four hypothetical Aboriginal tourism product descriptions and 31 individual features of Aboriginal tourism products to 337 visitors of northern British Columbia during the summer of 2007. I analyzed the data and established a profile of the travelers and their Aboriginal tourism product preferences. Based upon the identified primary features of Aboriginal tourism products I made several recommendations regarding tourism product development. Following this, I conducted a cluster analysis based on visitors' interest in these particular product features and in an attempt to segment the market for Aboriginal tourism in northern British Columbia. I identified three distinct clusters as the Culture Seekers, the Nature-Culture Observers and the Sightseers. The first two segments appear to hold the strongest potential for rural First Nation communities.

Thus, resource programs are commonly used to manage water quality conditions for endemic species. In a river system like the Nechako River system, central British Columbia, a water management program was established in the 1980s to alter water release in the summer months to prevent water temperatures from exceeding a 20 degrees C threshold downstream during the spawning season of Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). Such a management regime could have consequences for other resident species like the white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus). Here, we use a hydrothermal model and white sturgeon life stage-specific experimental thermal tolerance data to evaluate water releases and potential hydrothermal impacts based on the Nechako water management plan (1980-2019). Our analysis focused mainly on the warmest five-month period of the year (May to September), which includes the water release management period (July-August). Our results show that the thermal exposure risk, an index that measures temperature impact on species physiology of Nechako white sturgeon across all early life stages (embryo, yolk-sac larvae, larvae, and juvenile) has increased substantially, especially in the 2010s relative to the management program implementations' first decade (the 1980s). The embryonic life stage was the most impacted, with a continuous increase in potential adverse thermal exposure in all months examined in the study.

Grabs samples were also collected from two key tributaries and a large culvert.Results and discussionSome elements (e.g., As, Mn and P) decreased in a downstream direction due to inputs from agricultural sources in the headwaters, while others (e.g., Cr, Cu, Pb and Zn) increased downstream reflecting inputs from urban sources in the lower part of the watershed. Several PTEs increased significantly due to a large culvert which supplied road-deposited sediment (RDS) and other urban materials. In some cases (e.g., As, Mn, Zn) PTE concentrations exceeded Canadian sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the protection of aquatic organisms. While concentrations were similar for most years, they were elevated in 2016 which may reflect higher rainfall prior to sample collection. The average total storage of fine-grained sediment in the channel bed of McMillan Creek was 155 t (4198 g m(-2)), while for PTEs this ranged from 0.01 kg (0.0002 g m(-2)) for Hg to 1130 kg (30.7 g m(-2)) for Mn.ConclusionsThe channel bed of an urban river stored large amounts of fine sediment, PTEs and P, with concentrations that exceeded SQGs for some elements.

Our observations indicate that most of these events are not associated with surficial processes such as landslides, but rather, we hypothesize that the interaction of the Anahim Volcanic Belt and Coast Shear Zone has weakened the lithosphere in this region, leading to current-day strain localization and high heat flow that manifest seismicity, including swarm-like activity.",10.1139/cjes-2023-0057,2023,2023 DEC,[],False,,

While our findings are specific to the operation of the Nechako Reservoir, the issues that emerge are likely common to many reservoirs in areas where reservoir inflow regimes are currently snow-storage dominated. We found that projected changes in the timing of water availability have little to no influence on hydropower generation commitments. However, larger water releases will be required to avoid compromising reservoir safety, possibly endangering downstream fish habitat through scouring. Furthermore, the temperature of water released from the reservoir is projected to more frequently exceed a level, 20 degrees C, that is detrimental to migrating sockeye salmon. Water released is subject to further warming as it travels towards the lower reaches of the Nechako River used by migrating salmon. Hence, there is a need to adapt reservoir operations to ensure reservoir safety and mitigate adverse effects on salmon habitat.",10.1007/s10584-023-03632-y,2023,2023 DEC,[],False,,

The Sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka), a keystone species in north western aquatic ecosystems of North America, is profoundly affected by thermal regime changes in rivers, and it holds a pivotal role in ecological and economic contexts due to its life history, extensive distribution, and commercial fishery. In this study, we explore the effects of climate change on the thermal regime of the Nechako River (British Columbia, Canada), a relatively large river partially controlled by the Skins Lake Spillway. The CEQUEAU hydrological-thermal model was calibrated using discharge and water temperature observations. The model was forced using the Fifth generation of ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis data for the past and meteorological projections (downscaled and bias-corrected) from climate models for future scenarios. Hydrological calibration was completed for the 1980-2019 period using data from two hydrometric stations, and water temperature calibration was implemented using observations for 2005-2019 from eight water temperature stations. Changes in water temperature were assessed for two future periods (2040-2069 and 2070-2099) using eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 climate models and using two Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios (4.5 and 8.5 W/m2 by 2100) for each period. Results show that water temperatures above 20 degrees C (an upper threshold for adequate thermal habitat for Sockeye salmon migration in this river) at the Vanderhoof station will increase in daily frequency. While the frequency of occurrence of this phenomenon is 1% (0-9 days/summer) based on 2005-2019 observations, this number range is 3.8-36% (0-62 days/summer) according to the ensemble of climate change scenarios.

The Nechako River Basin (NRB) is a large, regulated basin in north-central British Columbia, Canada that has been impacted by numerous landscape disturbances, including a severe wildfire in 2018. Aims. The aims of this study were to quantify the post-wildfire temporal and spatial extent of contamination by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) of both soils and riverine sediments, and to identify the primary sources of PAHs in the watershed. Methods. Soil samples were collected at burned and unburned sites in 2018 and at the burned sites in 2020 and 2021. Sediment samples were collected at three tributaries impacted by wildfire and three Nechako River mainstem (i.e. main channel) sites from 2018 to 2021. Samples were analysed for parent PAHs. Key results. PAH concentrations decreased in soil samples from 2018 to 2021 but are not below the concentrations found in unburned samples. Tributary sediment samples showed higher concentrations immediately post-fire relative to the mainstem Nechako River, but in the years since, that trend has reversed. Conclusions. PAHs persist in terrestrial and aquatic environments for years following wildfire, but at concentrations below various quality guidelines. PAHs were primarily derived from the wildfires, with some mixed sources at the downstream sites. Implications.

In addition, many rivers globally are impacted by dams, which have many negative effects on fishes by altering flow, blocking fish passage, and changing sediment composition. However, in some systems, dams present an opportunity to manage river temperature through regulated releases of cooler water. For example, there is a government mandate for Kenney dam operators in the Nechako river, British Columbia, Canada, to maintain river temperature <20 degrees C in July and August to protect migrating sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). However, there is another endangered fish species inhabiting the same river, Nechako white sturgeon (Acipenser transmontanus), and it is unclear if these current temperature regulations, or timing of the regulations, are suitable for spawning and developing sturgeon. In this study, we aimed to identify upper thermal thresholds in white sturgeon embryos and larvae to investigate if exposure to current river temperatures are playing a role in recruitment failure. We incubated embryos and yolk-sac larvae in three environmentally relevant temperatures (14, 18 and 21 degrees C) throughout development to identify thermal thresholds across different levels of biological organization. Our results demonstrate upper thermal thresholds at 21 degrees C across physiological measurements in embryo and yolk-sac larvae white sturgeon. Before hatch, both embryo survival and metabolic rate were reduced at 21 degrees C. After hatch, sublethal consequences continued at 21 degrees C because larval sturgeon had decreased thermal plasticity and a dampened transcriptional response during development. In recent years, the Nechako river has reached 21 degrees C by the end of June, and at this temperature, a decrease in sturgeon performance is evident in most of the traits measured. As such, the thermal thresholds identified here suggest current temperature regulations may not be suitable for developing white sturgeon and future recruitment.",10.1093/conphys/coad032,2023,2023 JAN 1,[],False,,

To produce such ensembles, probabilistic meteorological forecasts can be fed into hydrological and water temperature models for different lead-times. This study aims to gauge the impact of the meteorological forecast quality on the accuracy and reliability of water temperature forecast ensembles generated through the HEC-RAS process-based hydrothermal model. The Nechako River, a managed river system in British Columbia, Canada, is used in this case study. The thermal forecasts were generated and evaluated from 2017 to 2020. The tested hypothesis is that improvements in the meteorological forecasts would result in reducing the uncertainty and improving the accuracy of the water temperature forecast ensembles at various lead-times. The results of this study show that the thermal forecasts were indeed improved in terms of their sharpness and their individual accuracy, but no significant impacts were noted over the accuracy of the ensembles. Reliability was also investigated, and it was revealed that water temperature forecast ensembles were initially under-dispersed over the Nechako River, and that this issue was exacerbated when the HEC-RAS model was forced with better quality ensemble weather forecasts. The presence of lakes along the river and the meteorological forecast's reliability are considered and discussed as causes for this issue. Overall, it was concluded that a reduction of the meteorological inputs' uncertainty did not improve the uncertainty representation of water temperature forecasts for this system.",10.1080/07011784.2022.2163189,2023,2023 APR 3,[],False,,

Traction material, brake wear, tire wear, and other particles entrained in snow during winter become re-suspended into the air as the snow melts. Characterization of within-season variability of road dust composition and weather conditions is critical to understanding its acute health impacts. Sixty 24-hour samples of PM10 were collected with a high-volume sampler at a near-road site in Prince George, British Columbia. Near-road samples were collected intermittently in winter and daily in spring. All samples were analyzed for 18 trace elements. We used data from a nearby regulatory monitor to estimate daily coarse fraction (PM10-2.5). Proportion of PM10-2.5 in PM10 was used to classify days as high or low road dust based on a threshold of 65% PM10-2.5. We identified clusters of near-road samples based on weather parameters and PM10 components using Bayesian profile regression (BPR). Twenty-one near-road PM10 samples were classified as high road dust days and 34 as low road dust days. Concentrations of total trace elements and specific trace elements were significantly higher on high road dust days (aluminum, chromium, iron, lead, tin, vanadium, and zinc). High road dust days also had low relative humidity and precipitation and higher temperature and air pressure. We identified five clusters of near-road PM10 mixtures that suggested an interaction between temperature and humidity for road dust impacts. Samples from a near-road site indicated days highly affected by springtime road dust are distinct from other days based on particulate mixtures and meteorological factors. Higher loading of trace element mixtures in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for acute toxicity of road dust. Relationships between road dust and weather may facilitate further research into health effects of road dust as the climate changes. Implications: Non-tailpipe emissions driven by springtime road dust in northern latitude communities is increasing in importance for air pollution control and improving our understanding of the health effects of chemical mixtures from particulate matter exposure. High-volume samples from a near-road site indicated that days affected by springtime road dust are substantively different from other days with respect to particulate matter mixture composition and meteorological drivers. The high load of trace elements in PM10 on high road dust days has important implications for the acute toxicity of inhaled air and subsequent health effects.

Eight passive solar design scenarios applied to two house designs were analyzed in terms of (i) reducing annual HVAC energy consumption and (ii) solar heating fraction. A calibrated model of the Canadian Centre for Housing Technology Twin Houses was developed using EnergyPlus and provided the simulation platform for this research. The results show that with basic passive solar design measures, solar gains contribute a considerable fraction of a typical single-family dwellings heating requirements in cold climates such as Canada (21-32%) with optimized passive solar designs attaining significant higher percentages (32-74%). This is generally higher than other similar studies. Based on the results very large solar fractions can be achieved with optimized passive solar design. The results of this study have relevance to individual building design as well as planning decisions regarding density and urban design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The general synchrony of outbreaks suggested that a large-scale extrinsic factor, such as weather, was at play. However, the imperfect synchrony of outbreaks suggested that local stand characteristics. such as canopy structure, composition of tree species and host plant quality, probably played a major role in preconditioning outbreaks.

The Cedar Project is a community-based study aiming to identify variables associated with ever being on methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) among young Aboriginal people using drugs and to discuss possible barriers to MMT in this population. Design and Methods. This is a prospective cohort study with recruitment by health-care providers, outreach, and word of mouth in Vancouver and Prince George. Participants included 605 Aboriginal participants who were age 14-30 years, reported illicit drug use in the month prior to enrolment, and provided written informed consent. Variables associated with ever being on MMT were analysed through chi(2)-testing and multivariate logistic regression, limited to people reporting opioid use (n = 397). Results. Less than half of participants reporting daily injection of opioids had ever been on MMT. In adjusted multivariate logistic regression analyses, older age [odds ratio (OR) 1.17; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08-1.28)]; female gender (OR 3.76; 95% CI 2.00-7.07); hepatitis C antibody positivity (OR 2.76; 95% CI 1.53-4.95); and daily opioid injection (OR 2.59; 95% CI 1.46-4.61) were positively associated with ever being on MMT. Weekly or more alcohol use (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.21-0.87) was negatively associated with ever being on MMT. Discussion and Conclusion. MMT access by young Aboriginal people is low. The associations between MMT use and other variables need further study to steer efforts directed at recruitment into MMT. The removal of barriers to MMT and inclusion of young Aboriginal people in the development of treatment programs based on Indigenous values are urgently required to help Aboriginal people who use drugs.

Finally, the kappa coefficient of agreement was used to quantify the degree of correspondence between the classified images. The results indicated that the spectral variability of the within-year image set exceeded the variability in the between-year image set and differences in class area were highly variable over the range of image acquisition dates.

The most interesting finding is the strong relationship between pest incidence and provenance distance to the western limit of the natural range of jack pine (Pinus banksiana Lamb.): the closer a lodgepole pine provenance is to the edge of jack pine distribution, the higher is its resistance to the pests. We hypothesize that jack pine introgression may have played a significant role in the evolution of pest defense in lodgepole pine.

Abstract This study investigated historical climate trends in northern British Columbia, Canada, through the use of tree-ring proxies, and established a means of reconstructing intra-annual climate patterns from wood density, fibre properties and tree-ring width data. Specific attention was given to investigating how dendroclimatological analyses of intra-ring wood and fibre properties could be interpreted to improve the strength of proxy climate records. Trees were sampled at six sites in northern British Columbia. Spruce trees were collected from the Smithers area, whilst Douglas-fir trees were sampled at the northern latitudinal extent of their range near Babine and Francois Lakes, and at a precipitation-limited site near Valemount. Wood cores were analysed by Windendro (R) software with an ITRAX scanning densitometer, and by the SilviScan system located at the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Research Organization. A mean June temperature proxy record dating to 1805 and a July-August mean temperature proxy record for Smithers extending from 1791 to 2006 were constructed from spruce ring width and maximum density chronologies. Douglas-fir ring width, spruce minimum density, and Douglas-fir maximum cell-wall thickness chronologies were used to reconstruct a May-June precipitation record extending from 1820 to 2006, and a July-August total precipitation record for Fort St. James that extends from 1912 to 2006. The results of the study demonstrate that a combination of multivariate and single-variate analyses provide detailed insights into seasonal radial growth characteristics.

The purpose of this article is to report on a set of successful strategies trialed with rural and FN communities in Canada. The strategies discussed were designed as part of a larger mixed-method study examining the effectiveness of Group Medical Visits (GMVs) on the quality of primary healthcare (PHC) in both FN reserve and northern communities in British Columbia (BC). Methods: Community partners and the study's decision-maker partners helped to identify and recruit primary care practices and reserve communities who were offering GMVs. Eleven communities (6 rural and 5 FN reserve) within the Northern Health Authority, BC participated in the study. Participants completed a survey either in person or via telephone. Content analysis was conducted on team meeting and field notes, focusing on issues related to the data collection process. Financial analysis was conducted on monetary resources spent on recruitment efforts in the various communities. Data were recorded regarding the number of times potential participants were contacted and mode of interview. Descriptive statistics were used to examine whether there were differences by mode of data collection, gender, and FN status. Logistic regression was used to examine whether FN status remained statistically significant after controlling for sex, education, employment status, age and health status. Results: Once people were contacted, participation rate was 68% with 269 (n=90 men, n=179 women) people. Of those who participated in the survey, 42% were from FN communities. Content analysis revealed two overarching categories: (1) communication and coordination of the geographically dispersed research team and participating communities was maintained using synchronous and asynchronous methods; and (2) flexibility was needed to tailor recruitment strategies. Financial resources required to achieve equitable recruitment across these communities can cost up to 17 times more than travel to sites accessible by a direct flight or car. The farther away from Prince George (BC's capital in the north), the more resources were needed to ensure equitable recruitment from a community. Community partners played a critical role in recruiting potential participants. Team members, particularly those from urban areas, require support to successfully navigate working in small northern communities. Conclusions: Achieving equity in recruitment requires flexibility, trusting partnerships within each community and regular communication among the research team.

Snow water equivalent (SWE) was measured on or near April 1, 1995 to 1997, and a forest inventory was completed at 64 points (15-m grid spacing) in each of nine stand types including mature and juvenile forests and clearcuts. Semivariograms revealed little evidence of spatial correlation among sample points, indicating that each sample could be considered statistically independent for analysis. Within the study stands, no strong spatial trends were evident through quadratic trend surface analysis. The within-stand coefficient of variation (CV) generally decreased with increasing mean accumulation. Spearman's rank correlation analysis and principal components analysis (PCA) indicated a weak to moderate similarity in snow accumulation patterns from year to year. Site-scale canopy measures do not appear to provide a reliable basis for parameterizing the variability of within-stand snow deposition. Through the fitting of general linear models (GLM), year alone accounted for 33% of the variability in snow water equivalent within stands, on average.

These forestry experts were somewhat concerned about the impacts of climate change, and they appeared unlikely to oppose strategies for preparing for and adapting to climate change. The respondents felt that the effects of climate change on forests and forest-based communities are not well understood by the general public or forest managers. They also felt that there is a relatively high level of uncertainty about the effects of climate change, especially with respect to forest-based communities.

Pre-mineralization suites range in composition from diorite to granodiorite. The synmineralization Jurassic-Cretaceous Francois Lake suite includes two granodiorite- to monzogranite-bearing subsuites. Postmineralization phases include the Eocene Sam Ross Creek monzogranite. The batholith spans a silica range of 44-80 wt.% and consists of metaluminous to slightly peraluminous, low- to high-K, I-type granitoids; the Sam Ross Creek phase is an A-type granite. Positive epsilon (Nd)(T) values (+1.1 to +7.2) indicate derivation predominately from juvenile source materials, but with variable input from an older crustal component. Evidence suggests generation of older plutonic suites in a juvenile arc-type setting and younger K-rich felsic suites via recycling of juvenile arc crust without significant mantle-derived contributions. Three distinct Mo-deposition events in the Endako camp are linked to repeated generations of oxidized, highly evolved monzogranitic phases (pre-ore dykes, aplitic Nithi and Casey intrusions) belonging to both Francois Lake subsuites. Late pre-ore dykes with ""Casey-like"" geochemical signatures, along with massive unmineralized Casey intrusions near the Endako deposit, could reflect repeated injections from an underlying magma chamber that remained molten during the youngest Mo-deposition event.

Using a climate index based on precipitation and air temperature anomalies, we find extreme forest fire seasons (those that burned >5% of a watershed's area) are most likely to occur when a warm/dry summer is preceded by multiple seasons of cool/wet conditions. Using the climate suitability class (CSC) model to explore the relationship between climate and MPB outbreaks, we validate previous findings that lower-than-average precipitation, warm growing season temperatures, and lack of extremely cold temperatures during winter are connected to MPB outbreaks within central BC. However, the CSC model needs improvements to accurately assess MPB suitability in northern watersheds that are located outside the model's calibration region, either through weighted variables or lower degree day thresholds. Minimal runoff response occurs from these forest disturbances, with the most prominent runoff change being related to the 2014 fire season in the Osilinka and Mesilinka watersheds.

The Low Pollution Sectors and Conditions (LPSC) method is based on existing measured long-term data sets and is designed for locations where particulate matter (PM) monitors are only influenced by local anthropogenic emission sources from particular wind sectors. The LPSC method combines the analysis of measured hourly meteorological data, PM concentrations, and geographical emission source distributions. PM background levels emerge from measured data for specific wind conditions, where air parcel trajectories measured at a monitoring station are assumed to have passed over geographic sectors with negligible local emissions. Seasonal and annual background levels were estimated for two monitoring stations in Prince George, Canada, and the method was also applied to four other small cities (Burns Lake, Houston, Quesnel, Smithers) in northern British Columbia. The analysis showed reasonable background concentrations for both monitoring stations in Prince George, whereas annual PM10 background concentrations at two of the other locations and PM2.5 background concentrations at one other location were implausibly high. For those locations where the LPSC method was successful, annual background levels ranged between 1.8 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) and 2.5 +/- 0.1 mu g/m(3) for PM2.5 and between 6.3 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3) and 8.5 +/- 0.3 mu g/m(3) for PM10. Precipitation effects and patterns of seasonal variability in the estimated background concentrations were detectable for all locations where the method was successful. Overall the method was dependent on the configuration of local geography and sources with respect to the monitoring location, and may fail at some locations and under some conditions. Where applicable, the LPSC method can provide a fast and cost-efficient way to estimate background PM concentrations for small cities in sparsely populated regions like northern British Columbia. Implications: In rural areas like northern British Columbia, particulate matter (PM) monitoring stations are usually located close to emission sources and residential areas in order to assess the PM impact on human health. Thus there is a lack of accurate PM background concentration data that represent PM ambient concentrations in the absence of local emissions. The background calculation method developed in this study uses observed meteorological data as well as local source emission locations and provides annual, seasonal and precipitation-related PM background concentrations that are comparable to literature values for four out of six monitoring stations.",10.1080/10962247.2013.789091,2013,2013,[],False,,

Past studies have leveraged temporal or spatiotemporal sequences of historical LC data to forecast changes with DL models. However, these studies do not adequately assess the association between neighborhood size and DL model capability to forecast LCCs, where neighborhood size refers to the spatial extent captured by each data sample. The objectives of this research study were to: (1) evaluate the effect of neighborhood size on the capacity of DL models to forecast LCCs, specifically Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN-TCN), and (2) assess the effect of auxiliary spatial variables on model capacity to forecast LCCs. First, each model type and neighborhood setting configuration was assessed using data derived from multitemporal MODIS LC for the Regional District of Bulkley-Nechako, Canada, comparing subareas exhibiting different amounts of LCCs with trends obtained for the full region. Next, outcomes were compared with three other study regions. The modeling results were evaluated with three-map comparison measures, where the real-world LC for the next timestep, the real-world LC for the previous timestep, and the forecasted LC for the next year were used to calculate correctly transitioned areas. Across all regions explored, it was observed that increasing neighborhood sizes improved the DL model's capabilities to forecast short-term LCCs. CNN-TCN models forecasted the most correct LCCs for several regions while reducing error due to quantity when provided additional spatial variables. This study contributes to the systematic exploration of neighborhood sizes on selected spatiotemporal DL techniques for geographic applications.",10.3390/rs14194957,2022,2022,[],False,,

No definite continuity between the two belts has been established in the pre-mid-Cretaceous geology, but this area may be a long-lived, episodic magmatic are and nearby are-related basin. The stratigraphic contrasts may reflect inherent differences between an are and related basinal sequence. Triassic volcanic-are sequences are part of the Stikine (western belt) and Cadwallader (eastern belt) terranes, which may be part of the same are. The Jurassic is represented by one dated pluton in the west compared with almost continuous deposition of volcanogenic elastic rocks in the east. Lower Cretaceous sequences in the west and east may represent a volcanic are and back-are basin. The Taylor Creek Group (Albian) is the first definitive link between the two belts and represents an are and intra-are or back-are basin. The structural evolution of the two belts also differs significantly. The early Late Cretaceous Eastern Waddington thrust belt comprises all major structures in the west, but only has minor expression in the east. Most of the structures in the east are part of the latest Cretaceous(?) to early Tertiary dextral-strike-slip, Yalakom fault system.

There is, however, a rich variation in responses that depends on factors such as the topographic complexity of the basin and the strength of maritime influences. We illustrate the potential effects of a strong maritime influence by studying future changes in cold season flow variability in the Fraser River Basin (FRB) of British Columbia, a large extratropical watershed extending from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific Coast. We use a process-based hydrological model driven by an ensemble of 21 statistically down-scaled simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5), following the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP 8.5). Warming under RCP 8.5 leads to reduced winter snowfall, shortening the average snow accumulation season by about one-third. Despite this, large increases in cold season rainfall lead to unprecedented cold season peak flows and increased overall runoff variability in the VIC simulations. Increased cold season rainfall is shown to be the dominant climatic driver in the Coast Mountains, contributing 60 % to mean cold season runoff changes in the 2080s. Cold season runoff at the outlet of the basin increases by 70 % by the 2080s, and its interannual variability more than doubles when compared to the 1990s, suggesting substantial challenges for operational flow forecasting in the region. Furthermore, almost half of the basin (45 %) transitions from a snow-dominated runoff regime in the 1990s to a primarily rain-dominated regime in the 2080s, according to a snowmelt pulse detection algorithm. While these projections are consistent with the anticipated transition from a nival to a nival-pluvial hydrologic regime, the marked increase in FRB cold season runoff is likely linked to more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers in the region projected in the CMIP5 models, providing in-sights for other maritime-influenced extratropical basins.",10.5194/hess-23-811-2019,2019,2019,[],False,,

The device is based on a passive magnetic sensor that produces signals of 10(-2) to 10(-5) V as its magnetic field is disturbed by passing clasts. A series of 82 sensors is housed in an aluminum beam placed across the stream, inserted such that its surface is flush with the gravel bed. The device can be raised or lowered to compensate for bed aggradation and scour. A data acquisition system gathers voltage signals from the sensors at rates of 30 to 100 Hz. This device is sensitive enough to record the movement of most volcanic, metamorphic, granitic and ultramafic clasts larger than a few millimetres. O'Ne-ell Creek watershed is a 68 km(2) tributary basin of the Middle River drainage system in the northern headwaters of the Fraser River. Bedload transport generally occurs twice a year in the Stuart-Takla streams: once during spring floods and again during salmon spawning activity. Bedload moved only during two days in 1998, at the peak of the relatively small nival food in May. Nevertheless, the device detected at least 3 x 10(6) passing clasts. A continuous record of bedload transport was obtained, showing a pulsating pattern of activity seemingly independent of stage, lateral movement of the transport zone, and a sudden onset of bed movement with a tapered cessation. We anticipate that more sophisticated calibration of the sensors and accelerated sampling rates will provide detailed information on the size and/or velocity and magnetic permeability of particles moving over the device, and will contribute to a better understanding of bedload transport.

Design Multisite, prospective, interventional cohort study. Setting Two urban community health centres in Vancouver and Prince George, BC. Participants Two hundred sixty-nine HIV-positive patients (18 years of age or older) who received primary care at either of the study sites. Intervention Systematic implementation of the CCM during an 18-month period. Main outcome measures Documented pneumococcal vaccination, documented syphilis screening, documented tuberculosis screening, antiretroviral treatment (ART) status, ART status with undetectable viral load, CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL, and CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/mL while not taking ART compared during a 36-month period. Results Overall, 35% of participants were women and 59% were aboriginal persons. The mean age was 45 years and most participants had a history of injection drug use that was the presumed route of HIV transmission. During the study follow-up period, 39 people died, and 11 transferred to alternate care providers. Compared with their baseline clinical status, study participants showed statistically significant (P<.001 for all) increases in pneumococcal immunization (54% vs 84%), syphilis screening (56% vs 91%), tuberculosis screening (23% vs 38%), and antiretroviral uptake (47% vs 77%), as well as increased viral load suppression rates among those receiving ART (72% vs 90%). Stable housing at baseline was associated with a 4-fold increased probability of survival. Aboriginal ethnicity was not associated with better or worse outcomes at baseline or at follow-up. Conclusion Application of the CCM approach to HIV care in a marginalized, largely aboriginal patient population led to improved disease screening, immunization, ART uptake, and virologic suppression rates. In addition to addressing underlying social determinants of health, a paradigm shift away from an ""infectious disease"" approach to a ""chronic disease management"" approach to HIV care for marginalized populations is strongly recommended.",,2013,2013,[],False,,

Numerical simulations indicate that these earthquakes would produce long-duration ground motions and would thus be capable of inducing a large number of reversals of inelastic deformations in engineered structures. Efforts have now been undertaken to account for this damage potential in building codes. In this paper, inelastic design spectra are developed for Cascadia subduction earthquakes for four sites in British Columbia. These spectra are compared with elastic design spectra that have been developed recently for the same sites based on empirical attenuation relationships for Cascadia events. The approach used to develop the inelastic spectra aims at providing the same level of protection against structural failure for both subduction events and crustal or subcrustal earthquakes. Force modification factors are first determined for structures exhibiting various failure modes and ductility levels when subjected to representative crustal and subcrustal earthquake ground motions. Thereafter, design spectra are developed for the same structures to prevent structural collapse under simulated Cascadia subduction ground motions. The study reveals that the elastic spectra do not reflect adequately the damage potential of Cascadia earthquakes. These elastic spectra generally are unconservative for Tofino and Victoria. For Vancouver and Prince George, the elastic spectra overestimate the demand, especially for short-period structures.",,1998,1998,[],False,,

Early research on the impacts of the NMP revealed a high degree of social connectedness. The objective of the present study was to explore the role of social capital in supporting the regional training site and the benefits accrued to a broad range of stakeholders and network partners. Methods: In this qualitative study, 23 semi-structured interviews were conducted with community leaders in 2007. A descriptive content analysis based on analytic induction technique was employed. Carpiano's Bourdieu-based framework of 'neighbourhood' social capital was adapted to empirically describe how social capital was produced and mobilized within and among networks during the planning and implementation of the NMP. Results: Results from this study reveal that the operation of social capital and the related concept of social cohesion are multifaceted, and that benefits extend in many directions, resulting in somewhat unanticipated benefits for other key stakeholders and network partners of this medical education program. Participants described four aspects of social capital: (i) social cohesion; ii) social capital resources; (iii) access to social capital; and (iv) outcomes of social capital. Conclusions: The findings of this study suggest that the partnerships and networks formed in the NMP planning and implementation phases were the foundation for social capital mobilization. The use of Carpiano's spatially-bounded model of social capital was useful in this context because it permitted the characterization of relations and networks of a tight-knit community body. The students, faculty and administrators of the NMP have benefitted greatly from access to the social capital mobilized to make the NMP operational. Taking account of the dynamic and multifaceted operation of social capital helps one move beyond a view of geographic communities as simply containers or sinks of capital investment, and to appreciate the degree to which they may act as a platform for productive network formation and expansion.",,2011,2011,[],False,,
